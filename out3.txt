Title: Physiological characterization of single-gene lysis proteins.
Abstract: Single-strand RNA (ssRNA) and single-strand DNA phages elicit host lysis using a single gene, in each case designated as <i>sgl</i>. Of the 11 identified Sgls, three have been shown to be specific inhibitors of different steps in the pathway that supplies lipid II to the peptidoglycan (PG) biosynthesis machinery. These Sgls have been called "protein antibiotics" because the lytic event is a septal catastrophe indistinguishable from that caused by cell wall antibiotics. Here, we designate these as type I Sgls. In this formalism, the other eight Sgls are assigned to type II, the best-studied of which is protein L of the paradigm F-specific ssRNA phage MS2. Comparisons have suggested that type II Sgls have four sequence elements distinguished by hydrophobic and polar character. Environmental metatranscriptomics has revealed thousands of new ssRNA phage genomes, each of which presumably has an Sgl. Here, we describe methods to distinguish type I and type II Sgls. Using phase contrast microscopy, we show that both classes of Sgls cause the formation of blebs prior to lysis, but the location of the blebs differs significantly. In addition, we show that L and other type II Sgls do not inhibit the net synthesis of PG, as measured by radio-labeling of PG. Finally, we provide direct evidence that the Sgl from <i>Pseudomonas</i> phage PP7 is a type I Sgl, in support of a recent report based on a genetic selection. This shows that the putative four-element sequence structure suggested for L is not a reliable discriminator for the operational characterization of Sgls.

Rating: ChatCompletionMessage(content='The abstract does not directly discuss modifying the MS2 phage lysis protein to not require binding to DNAJ, which is the goal of the research in phage therapy against multidrug-resistant E. coli. While the abstract talks about different types of Sgls and their mechanisms of action, the specific focus on modifying the MS2 phage lysis protein to avoid binding to DNAJ is not addressed. Additionally, the abstract does not discuss the relevance of these findings to phage therapy against multidrug-resistant E. coli. Overall, this abstract appears to be more focused on characterizing different types of Sgls rather than specifically addressing the goal of modifying the MS2 phage lysis protein.\n\nRating: 2/10', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)

Title: Comparing the Fate and Transport of MS2 Bacteriophage and Sodium Fluorescein in a Karstic Chalk Aquifer.
Abstract: Groundwater flow and contaminant migration tracing is a vital method of identifying and characterising pollutant source-pathway-receptor linkages in karst aquifers. Bacteriophages are an attractive alternative tracer to non-reactive fluorescent dye tracers, as high titres (>10<sup>12</sup> pfu mL<sup>-1</sup>) can be safely released into the aquifer, offering improved tracer detectability. However, the interpretation of bacteriophage tracer breakthrough curves is complicated as their fate and transport are impacted by aquifer physicochemical conditions. A comparative tracer migration experiment was conducted in a peri-urban catchment in southeast England to characterise the behaviour of MS2 bacteriophage relative to sodium fluorescein dye in a karstic chalk aquifer. Tracers were released into a stream sink and detected at two abstraction boreholes located 3 km and 10 km away. At both sites, the loss of MS2 phage greatly exceeded that of the solute tracer. In contrast, the qualitative shape of the dye and phage breakthrough curves were visually very similar, suggesting that the bacteriophage arriving at each site was governed by comparable transport parameters to the non-reactive dye tracer. The colloid filtration theory was applied to explain the apparent contradiction of comparable tracer breakthrough patterns despite massive phage losses in the subsurface. One-dimensional transport models were also fitted to each breakthrough curve to facilitate a quantitative comparison of the transport parameter values. The model results suggest that the bacteriophage migrates through the conduit system slightly faster than the fluorescent dye, but that the former is significantly less dispersed. These results suggest that whilst the bacteriophage tracer cannot be used to predict receptor concentrations from transport via karstic flow paths, it can provide estimates for groundwater flow and solute contaminant transit times. This study also provides insight into the attenuation and transport of pathogenic viruses in karstic chalk aquifers.

Title: Mitigation of viruses of concern and bacteriophage surrogates via common unit processes for water reuse: A meta-analysis.
Abstract: Water reuse is a growing global reality. In regulating water reuse, viruses have come to the fore as key pathogens due to high shedding rates, low infectious doses, and resilience to traditional wastewater treatments. To demonstrate the high log reductions required by emerging water reuse regulations, cost and practicality necessitate surrogates for viruses for use as challenge organisms in unit process evaluation and monitoring. Bacteriophage surrogates that are mitigated to the same or lesser extent than viruses of concern are routinely used for individual unit process testing. However, the behavior of these surrogates over a multi-barrier treatment train typical of water reuse has not been well-established. Toward this aim, we performed a meta-analysis of log reductions of common bacteriophage surrogates for five treatment processes typical of water reuse treatment trains: advanced oxidation processes, chlorination, membrane filtration, ozonation, and ultraviolet (UV) disinfection. Robust linear regression was applied to identify a range of doses consistent with a given log reduction of bacteriophages and viruses of concern for each treatment process. The results were used to determine relative conservatism of surrogates. We found that no one bacteriophage was a representative or conservative surrogate for viruses of concern across all multi-barrier treatments (encompassing multiple mechanisms of virus mitigation). Rather, a suite of bacteriophage surrogates provides both a representative range of inactivation and information about the effectiveness of individual processes within a treatment train. Based on the abundance of available data and diversity of virus treatability using these five key water reuse treatment processes, bacteriophages MS2, phiX174, and Qbeta were recommended as a core suite of surrogates for virus challenge testing.

Title: Evaluation of woodchips-amended biosand filter for nitrate and MS2 bacteriophage reduction.
Abstract: In this study, two types of woodchip-amended biosand filters (Filter A sand: woodchip = 33%: 67% versus Filter B sand: woodchip = 50%: 50%, by volume) were constructed, and their abilities to remove MS2 bacteriophage and nitrate were investigated. The results indicated that Filter A and Filter B could reduce nitrate up to 40 and 36%, respectively, indicating that the nitrate reduction increased with the increase in woodchip proportion. The study underscores a positive correlation between nitrate reduction and proportional increase in woodchip content, implying the potential for fine-tuning nitrate removal by varying sand-woodchip compositions. W-BSFs could remove MS2 bacteriophage to 1.91-log10 (98.8%) by Filter A and 1.88-log10 (98.7%) by Filter B over 39 weeks. The difference in sand-woodchip proportion did not significantly impact the MS2 reduction, demonstrating that a single W-BSF can maintain its virus removal performance fairly well over a long-term period. These results indicated that the nitrate reduction could be adjusted by varying sand-woodchip contents without impacting virus removal performance. Microbial community analysis indicated that the nitrate removal by the W-BSFs could be attributed to the denitrifying bacteria, such as the family Streptomycetaceae, the genera Pseudomonas, and Bacillus, and relative abundances of the phylum Nitrospirae.

Rating: ChatCompletionMessage(content='This study investigates the impact of sand-woodchip composition in biosand filters on nitrate reduction and MS2 bacteriophage removal.

Title: Lateral flow immunoassay based on surface-enhanced Raman scattering using pH-induced phage-templated hierarchical plasmonic assembly for point-of-care diagnosis of infectious disease.
Abstract: The outbreak of emerging infectious diseases gave rise to the demand for reliable point-of-care testing methods to diagnose and manage those diseases in early onset. However, the current on-site testing methods including lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) suffer from the inaccurate diagnostic result due to the low sensitivity. Herein, we present the surface-enhanced Raman scattering-based lateral flow immunoassay (SERS-LFIA) by introducing phage-templated hierarchical plasmonic assembly (PHPA) nanoprobes to diagnose a contagious disease. The PHPA was fabricated using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) assembled on bacteriophage MS2, where inter-particle gap sizes can be adjusted by pH-induced morphological alteration of MS2 coat proteins to provide the maximum SERS amplification efficiency via plasmon coupling. The plasmonic probes based on the PHPA produce strong and reproducible SERS signal that leads to sensitive and reliable diagnostic results in SERS-LFIA. The developed SERS-LFIA targeting severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies for a proof of concept had <100 pg/mL detection limits with high specificity in serum, proving it as an effective diagnostic device for the infectious diseases. Clinical validation using human serum samples further confirmed that the PHPA-based SERS-LFIA can distinguish the patients with COVID-19 from healthy controls with significant accuracy. These outcomes prove that the developed SERS-LFIA biosensor can be an alternative point-of-care testing (POCT) method against the emerging infectious diseases, in combination with the commercially available portable Raman devices.

Title: Biological Properties of Recently Described Wild Bramble <i>Rubus oklejewiczii</i> against the Species from Similar Niches.
Abstract: The aim of this study was to compare the biological properties, such as antiviral, antibacterial, and antioxidant, of recently described pentaploid species <i>Rubus oklejewiczii</i> with tetraploid taxa growing in similar habitats including <i>R. plicatus</i>, <i>R. gracilis</i>, and <i>R. wimmerianus</i>. The antiviral potential was analyzed against bacteriophages with different genetic material: phi6 (a surrogate for the SARS-CoV-2 virus), T7, phiX174, and MS2. Antibacterial properties of fruit and leaf extracts were determined against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Bacillus cereus</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and <i>Salmonella enterica</i>. The total phenolic content, as well as anthocyanins, ascorbic acid, pH, and antioxidant properties (FRAP and DPPH) were determined. <i>R. oklejewiczii</i> leaf extract was characterized by the weakest antibacterial and antiviral properties, which was closely correlated with the lowest content of polyphenolic compounds and antioxidant properties. The strongest biological properties were observed for <i>R. wimmerianus</i> leaves. Fruit extracts were characterized by lower phenolic content and antioxidant activities than leaves, with the lowest values observed for <i>R. oklejewiczii</i> extract. The antibacterial properties of fruit extracts were strongest for <i>R. gracilis</i>. The strongest antiviral potential was observed for <i>R. oklejewiczii</i> and <i>R. wimmerianus</i> fruit extracts against the bacteriophage phi6, which correlated with the lowest pH and the highest ascorbic acid content. The positive effect of the higher ploidy of <i>R. oklejewiczii</i> for most of the analyzed biological properties was not observed except for the antiviral potential of fruit extract. Due to its large and tasty fruits, this species seems to be very promising for cultivation and attractive for consumers, even though most of its biological properties were not any better compared to other examined tetraploid species.

Title: Effect of coat-protein concentration on the self-assembly of bacteriophage MS2 capsids around RNA.
Abstract: Self-assembly is a vital part of the life cycle of certain icosahedral RNA viruses. Furthermore, the assembly process can be harnessed to make icosahedral virus-like particles (VLPs) from coat protein and RNA <i>in vitro</i>. Although much previous work has explored the effects of RNA-protein interactions on the assembly products, relatively little research has explored the effects of coat-protein concentration. We mix coat protein and RNA from bacteriophage MS2, and we use a combination of gel electrophoresis, dynamic light scattering, and transmission electron microscopy to investigate the assembly products. We show that with increasing coat-protein concentration, the products transition from well-formed MS2 VLPs to "monster" particles consisting of multiple partial capsids to RNA-protein condensates consisting of large networks of RNA and partially assembled capsids. We argue that the transition from well-formed to monster particles arises because the assembly follows a nucleation-and-growth pathway in which the nucleation rate depends sensitively on the coat-protein concentration, such that at high protein concentrations, multiple nuclei can form on each RNA strand. To understand the formation of the condensates, which occurs at even higher coat-protein concentrations, we use Monte Carlo simulations with coarse-grained models of capsomers and RNA. These simulations suggest that the formation of condensates occurs by the adsorption of protein to the RNA followed by the assembly of capsids. Multiple RNA molecules can become trapped when a capsid grows from capsomers attached to two different RNA molecules or when excess protein bridges together growing capsids on different RNA molecules. Our results provide insight into an important biophysical process and could inform design rules for making VLPs for various applications.

Title: A Novel Thermostable and Processive Reverse Transcriptase from a Group II Intron of <i>Anoxybacillus flavithermus</i>.
Abstract: Reverse transcriptases (RTs) are a family of enzymes that synthesize DNA using an RNA template and are involved in retrovirus propagation and telomere lengthening. In vitro, RTs are widely applied in various methods, including RNA-seq, RT-PCR, and RT-LAMP. Thermostable RTs from bacterial group II introns are promising tools for biotechnology due to their higher thermostability, fidelity, and processivity compared to commonly used M-MuLV RT and its mutants. However, the diversity of group II intron-encoded RTs is still understudied. In this work, we biochemically characterized a novel RT from a thermophilic bacterium, <i>Anoxybacillus flavithermus</i>, which was isolated from a hot spring in New Zealand and has an optimal growth temperature of around 60 °C. The cloned RT, named Afl RT, retained approximately 40% of the specific activity after a 45 min incubation at 50 °C. The optimal pH was 8.5, the optimal temperature was between 45 and 50 °C, and Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions were found to be an optimal cofactor. The processivity analysis with MS2 phage gRNA (3569 b) demonstrated that Afl RT elongated fully up to 36% of the template molecules. In reverse transcription and RT-qLAMP, the enzyme allowed up to 10 copies of MS2 phage genomic RNA to be detected per reaction. Thus, Afl RT holds great potential for a variety of practical applications that require the use of thermostable and processive RTs.

Title: Aggregation-Induced Emission-Armored Living Bacteriophage-DNA Nanobioconjugates for Targeting, Imaging, and Efficient Elimination of Intracellular Bacterial Infection.
Abstract: Intracellular bacterial infections bring a considerable risk to human life and health due to their capability to elude immune defenses and exhibit significant drug resistance. As a result, confronting and managing these infections present substantial challenges. In this study, we developed a multifunctional living phage nanoconjugate by integrating aggregation-induced emission luminogen (AIEgen) photosensitizers and nucleic acids onto a bacteriophage framework (forming MS2-DNA-AIEgen bioconjugates). These nanoconjugates can rapidly penetrate mammalian cells and specifically identify intracellular bacteria while concurrently producing a detectable fluorescent signal. By harnessing the photodynamic property of AIEgen photosensitizer and the bacteriophage's inherent targeting and lysis capability, the intracellular bacteria can be effectively eliminated and the activity of the infected cells can be restored. Moreover, our engineered phage nanoconjugates were able to expedite the healing process in bacterially infected wounds observed in diabetic mice models while simultaneously enhancing immune activity within infected cells and <i>in vivo</i>, without displaying noticeable toxicity. We envision that these multifunctional phage nanoconjugates, which utilize AIEgen photosensitizers and spherical nucleic acids, may present a groundbreaking strategy for combating intracellular bacteria and offer powerful avenues for theranostic applications in intracellular bacterial infection-associated diseases.
