Title: Physiological characterization of single-gene lysis proteins.
Abstract: Single-strand RNA (ssRNA) and single-strand DNA phages elicit host lysis using a single gene, in each case designated as <i>sgl</i>. Of the 11 identified Sgls, three have been shown to be specific inhibitors of different steps in the pathway that supplies lipid II to the peptidoglycan (PG) biosynthesis machinery. These Sgls have been called "protein antibiotics" because the lytic event is a septal catastrophe indistinguishable from that caused by cell wall antibiotics. Here, we designate these as type I Sgls. In this formalism, the other eight Sgls are assigned to type II, the best-studied of which is protein L of the paradigm F-specific ssRNA phage MS2. Comparisons have suggested that type II Sgls have four sequence elements distinguished by hydrophobic and polar character. Environmental metatranscriptomics has revealed thousands of new ssRNA phage genomes, each of which presumably has an Sgl. Here, we describe methods to distinguish type I and type II Sgls. Using phase contrast microscopy, we show that both classes of Sgls cause the formation of blebs prior to lysis, but the location of the blebs differs significantly. In addition, we show that L and other type II Sgls do not inhibit the net synthesis of PG, as measured by radio-labeling of PG. Finally, we provide direct evidence that the Sgl from <i>Pseudomonas</i> phage PP7 is a type I Sgl, in support of a recent report based on a genetic selection. This shows that the putative four-element sequence structure suggested for L is not a reliable discriminator for the operational characterization of Sgls.

Rating: This abstract is moderately relevant to the research objective. It discusses the classification of MS2 phage lysis protein (Sgl) and provides insights into its functionality and mechanism of cell lysis. The details about type II Sgls, to which MS2 belongs, could be crucial in understanding how to modify the protein. However, the abstract doesnâ€™t specifically discuss the interaction of MS2 L protein with DNAJ or strategies to modify it, which is the primary objective. Thus, this paper might provide fundamental information on the MS2 lysis protein but likely won't provide a direct solution. Rating: 6/10.

Title: Comparing the Fate and Transport of MS2 Bacteriophage and Sodium Fluorescein in a Karstic Chalk Aquifer.
Abstract: Groundwater flow and contaminant migration tracing is a vital method of identifying and characterising pollutant source-pathway-receptor linkages in karst aquifers. Bacteriophages are an attractive alternative tracer to non-reactive fluorescent dye tracers, as high titres (>10<sup>12</sup> pfu mL<sup>-1</sup>) can be safely released into the aquifer, offering improved tracer detectability. However, the interpretation of bacteriophage tracer breakthrough curves is complicated as their fate and transport are impacted by aquifer physicochemical conditions. A comparative tracer migration experiment was conducted in a peri-urban catchment in southeast England to characterise the behaviour of MS2 bacteriophage relative to sodium fluorescein dye in a karstic chalk aquifer. Tracers were released into a stream sink and detected at two abstraction boreholes located 3 km and 10 km away. At both sites, the loss of MS2 phage greatly exceeded that of the solute tracer. In contrast, the qualitative shape of the dye and phage breakthrough curves were visually very similar, suggesting that the bacteriophage arriving at each site was governed by comparable transport parameters to the non-reactive dye tracer. The colloid filtration theory was applied to explain the apparent contradiction of comparable tracer breakthrough patterns despite massive phage losses in the subsurface. One-dimensional transport models were also fitted to each breakthrough curve to facilitate a quantitative comparison of the transport parameter values. The model results suggest that the bacteriophage migrates through the conduit system slightly faster than the fluorescent dye, but that the former is significantly less dispersed. These results suggest that whilst the bacteriophage tracer cannot be used to predict receptor concentrations from transport via karstic flow paths, it can provide estimates for groundwater flow and solute contaminant transit times. This study also provides insight into the attenuation and transport of pathogenic viruses in karstic chalk aquifers.

Rating: This abstract is not particularly relevant to the goal of using the MS2 phage for phage therapy against multidrug resistant E. coli, as it primarily discusses the use of the virus as a tracer rather than being explicit about its utility in therapy or how to modify the lysis protein. However, it does explore MS2 in a complex environment, which may have tangential relevance to engineering the phage for therapy. Rating: 2/10

Title: Mitigation of viruses of concern and bacteriophage surrogates via common unit processes for water reuse: A meta-analysis.
Abstract: Water reuse is a growing global reality. In regulating water reuse, viruses have come to the fore as key pathogens due to high shedding rates, low infectious doses, and resilience to traditional wastewater treatments. To demonstrate the high log reductions required by emerging water reuse regulations, cost and practicality necessitate surrogates for viruses for use as challenge organisms in unit process evaluation and monitoring. Bacteriophage surrogates that are mitigated to the same or lesser extent than viruses of concern are routinely used for individual unit process testing. However, the behavior of these surrogates over a multi-barrier treatment train typical of water reuse has not been well-established. Toward this aim, we performed a meta-analysis of log reductions of common bacteriophage surrogates for five treatment processes typical of water reuse treatment trains: advanced oxidation processes, chlorination, membrane filtration, ozonation, and ultraviolet (UV) disinfection. Robust linear regression was applied to identify a range of doses consistent with a given log reduction of bacteriophages and viruses of concern for each treatment process. The results were used to determine relative conservatism of surrogates. We found that no one bacteriophage was a representative or conservative surrogate for viruses of concern across all multi-barrier treatments (encompassing multiple mechanisms of virus mitigation). Rather, a suite of bacteriophage surrogates provides both a representative range of inactivation and information about the effectiveness of individual processes within a treatment train. Based on the abundance of available data and diversity of virus treatability using these five key water reuse treatment processes, bacteriophages MS2, phiX174, and Qbeta were recommended as a core suite of surrogates for virus challenge testing.

Rating: While this abstract examines the effectiveness of bacteriophages, including MS2, in water treatment processes, it does not delve into the specifics of modifying the MS2 phage lysis protein or its interaction with DNAJ. While it can be argued that it indirectly relates to the use of phages in therapy, it does not specifically address the aim of using MS2 phage in phage therapy on multidrug resistant E. coli. Therefore, its relevance to the research question is low.

Title: Heat inactivation of aqueous viable norovirus and MS2 bacteriophage.
Abstract: This study aimed to compare the heat inactivation kinetics of viable human norovirus with the surrogate, MS2 bacteriophage as well as assess the decay of the RNA signal.

Rating: This abstract is not very relevant to the goal of modifying the MS2 phage lysis protein so that it can be used in phage therapy on multidrug resistant E. coli. It mostly concerns heat inactivation kinetics and norovirus, which are quite unrelated to the specific goal of this study. Rating: 2/10.

Title: Evaluation of woodchips-amended biosand filter for nitrate and MS2 bacteriophage reduction.
Abstract: In this study, two types of woodchip-amended biosand filters (Filter A sand: woodchip = 33%: 67% versus Filter B sand: woodchip = 50%: 50%, by volume) were constructed, and their abilities to remove MS2 bacteriophage and nitrate were investigated. The results indicated that Filter A and Filter B could reduce nitrate up to 40 and 36%, respectively, indicating that the nitrate reduction increased with the increase in woodchip proportion. The study underscores a positive correlation between nitrate reduction and proportional increase in woodchip content, implying the potential for fine-tuning nitrate removal by varying sand-woodchip compositions. W-BSFs could remove MS2 bacteriophage to 1.91-log10 (98.8%) by Filter A and 1.88-log10 (98.7%) by Filter B over 39 weeks. The difference in sand-woodchip proportion did not significantly impact the MS2 reduction, demonstrating that a single W-BSF can maintain its virus removal performance fairly well over a long-term period. These results indicated that the nitrate reduction could be adjusted by varying sand-woodchip contents without impacting virus removal performance. Microbial community analysis indicated that the nitrate removal by the W-BSFs could be attributed to the denitrifying bacteria, such as the family Streptomycetaceae, the genera Pseudomonas, and Bacillus, and relative abundances of the phylum Nitrospirae.

Rating: While this study provides interesting information about the removal of MS2 bacteriophage using different types of woodchip-amended biosand filters, it doesn't provide direct information about modifying the MS2 phage lysis protein or DNAJ binding which is essential for our research. Therefore, it is not highly relevant to our specific goal. Rating: 2/10.

Title: Lateral flow immunoassay based on surface-enhanced Raman scattering using pH-induced phage-templated hierarchical plasmonic assembly for point-of-care diagnosis of infectious disease.
Abstract: The outbreak of emerging infectious diseases gave rise to the demand for reliable point-of-care testing methods to diagnose and manage those diseases in early onset. However, the current on-site testing methods including lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) suffer from the inaccurate diagnostic result due to the low sensitivity. Herein, we present the surface-enhanced Raman scattering-based lateral flow immunoassay (SERS-LFIA) by introducing phage-templated hierarchical plasmonic assembly (PHPA) nanoprobes to diagnose a contagious disease. The PHPA was fabricated using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) assembled on bacteriophage MS2, where inter-particle gap sizes can be adjusted by pH-induced morphological alteration of MS2 coat proteins to provide the maximum SERS amplification efficiency via plasmon coupling. The plasmonic probes based on the PHPA produce strong and reproducible SERS signal that leads to sensitive and reliable diagnostic results in SERS-LFIA. The developed SERS-LFIA targeting severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies for a proof of concept had <100Â pg/mL detection limits with high specificity in serum, proving it as an effective diagnostic device for the infectious diseases. Clinical validation using human serum samples further confirmed that the PHPA-based SERS-LFIA can distinguish the patients with COVID-19 from healthy controls with significant accuracy. These outcomes prove that the developed SERS-LFIA biosensor can be an alternative point-of-care testing (POCT) method against the emerging infectious diseases, in combination with the commercially available portable Raman devices.

Rating: The abstract is not directly relevant to the goal of using the MS2 phage in phage therapy on multidrug resistant e. Coli. While it mentions the use of bacteriophage MS2 in the creation of SERS-LFIA diagnostic tests, this is different from considering modifications of the bacteriophage lysis protein and its interaction with DNAJ, or from specific applications in phage therapy. Similarly, while the study is about infectious diseases, it specifically focuses on diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, not on E. coli or phage therapy for multidrug-resistant strains. Given these parameters, I would rate this abstract a 2/10 for relevance to the specified research goal.

Title: Biological Properties of Recently Described Wild Bramble <i>Rubus oklejewiczii</i> against the Species from Similar Niches.
Abstract: The aim of this study was to compare the biological properties, such as antiviral, antibacterial, and antioxidant, of recently described pentaploid species <i>Rubus oklejewiczii</i> with tetraploid taxa growing in similar habitats including <i>R. plicatus</i>, <i>R. gracilis</i>, and <i>R. wimmerianus</i>. The antiviral potential was analyzed against bacteriophages with different genetic material: phi6 (a surrogate for the SARS-CoV-2 virus), T7, phiX174, and MS2. Antibacterial properties of fruit and leaf extracts were determined against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Bacillus cereus</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and <i>Salmonella enterica</i>. The total phenolic content, as well as anthocyanins, ascorbic acid, pH, and antioxidant properties (FRAP and DPPH) were determined. <i>R. oklejewiczii</i> leaf extract was characterized by the weakest antibacterial and antiviral properties, which was closely correlated with the lowest content of polyphenolic compounds and antioxidant properties. The strongest biological properties were observed for <i>R. wimmerianus</i> leaves. Fruit extracts were characterized by lower phenolic content and antioxidant activities than leaves, with the lowest values observed for <i>R. oklejewiczii</i> extract. The antibacterial properties of fruit extracts were strongest for <i>R. gracilis</i>. The strongest antiviral potential was observed for <i>R. oklejewiczii</i> and <i>R. wimmerianus</i> fruit extracts against the bacteriophage phi6, which correlated with the lowest pH and the highest ascorbic acid content. The positive effect of the higher ploidy of <i>R. oklejewiczii</i> for most of the analyzed biological properties was not observed except for the antiviral potential of fruit extract. Due to its large and tasty fruits, this species seems to be very promising for cultivation and attractive for consumers, even though most of its biological properties were not any better compared to other examined tetraploid species.

Rating: This abstract has very low relevance to the goal of modifying the MS2 phage lysis protein for use in phage therapy against multidrug-resistant E. coli. Although it does mention MS2 phage, it's in the context of assessing the antiviral properties of different fruit and leaf extracts against various bacteriophages, including MS2. However, there's no specific information or discussion about potentially modifying MS2's lysis protein or its interaction with DNAJ, which is the main goal. Rating: 1/10.

Title: Effect of coat-protein concentration on the self-assembly of bacteriophage MS2 capsids around RNA.
Abstract: Self-assembly is a vital part of the life cycle of certain icosahedral RNA viruses. Furthermore, the assembly process can be harnessed to make icosahedral virus-like particles (VLPs) from coat protein and RNA <i>in vitro</i>. Although much previous work has explored the effects of RNA-protein interactions on the assembly products, relatively little research has explored the effects of coat-protein concentration. We mix coat protein and RNA from bacteriophage MS2, and we use a combination of gel electrophoresis, dynamic light scattering, and transmission electron microscopy to investigate the assembly products. We show that with increasing coat-protein concentration, the products transition from well-formed MS2 VLPs to "monster" particles consisting of multiple partial capsids to RNA-protein condensates consisting of large networks of RNA and partially assembled capsids. We argue that the transition from well-formed to monster particles arises because the assembly follows a nucleation-and-growth pathway in which the nucleation rate depends sensitively on the coat-protein concentration, such that at high protein concentrations, multiple nuclei can form on each RNA strand. To understand the formation of the condensates, which occurs at even higher coat-protein concentrations, we use Monte Carlo simulations with coarse-grained models of capsomers and RNA. These simulations suggest that the formation of condensates occurs by the adsorption of protein to the RNA followed by the assembly of capsids. Multiple RNA molecules can become trapped when a capsid grows from capsomers attached to two different RNA molecules or when excess protein bridges together growing capsids on different RNA molecules. Our results provide insight into an important biophysical process and could inform design rules for making VLPs for various applications.

Rating: While this abstract discusses research on the assembly process of the bacteriophage MS2, it does not specifically address the modification of the MS2 phage lysis protein or its potential to bypass binding to DNAJ. It does though provide information about the assembly of the MS2 which could be relevant to further understanding the virus's structure and behavior, which could aid in its potential modification for therapeutic uses.

Title: A Novel Thermostable and Processive Reverse Transcriptase from a Group II Intron of <i>Anoxybacillus flavithermus</i>.
Abstract: Reverse transcriptases (RTs) are a family of enzymes that synthesize DNA using an RNA template and are involved in retrovirus propagation and telomere lengthening. In vitro, RTs are widely applied in various methods, including RNA-seq, RT-PCR, and RT-LAMP. Thermostable RTs from bacterial group II introns are promising tools for biotechnology due to their higher thermostability, fidelity, and processivity compared to commonly used M-MuLV RT and its mutants. However, the diversity of group II intron-encoded RTs is still understudied. In this work, we biochemically characterized a novel RT from a thermophilic bacterium, <i>Anoxybacillus flavithermus</i>, which was isolated from a hot spring in New Zealand and has an optimal growth temperature of around 60 Â°C. The cloned RT, named Afl RT, retained approximately 40% of the specific activity after a 45 min incubation at 50 Â°C. The optimal pH was 8.5, the optimal temperature was between 45 and 50 Â°C, and Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions were found to be an optimal cofactor. The processivity analysis with MS2 phage gRNA (3569 b) demonstrated that Afl RT elongated fully up to 36% of the template molecules. In reverse transcription and RT-qLAMP, the enzyme allowed up to 10 copies of MS2 phage genomic RNA to be detected per reaction. Thus, Afl RT holds great potential for a variety of practical applications that require the use of thermostable and processive RTs.

Rating: While this abstract does mention the MS2 phage, it primarily focuses on the characterization of a unique reverse transcriptase from the bacterium Anoxybacillus flavithermus. The relevance to modifying the MS2 phage lysis protein or its possible usage in phage therapy against multidrug resistant E. coli is not discussed. The focus on reverse transcriptases also does not directly relate to our primary interest of the MS2 phage lysis protein and its interaction with DNAJ. Therefore, this abstract has low relevance to the topic.

Title: Aggregation-Induced Emission-Armored Living Bacteriophage-DNA Nanobioconjugates for Targeting, Imaging, and Efficient Elimination of Intracellular Bacterial Infection.
Abstract: Intracellular bacterial infections bring a considerable risk to human life and health due to their capability to elude immune defenses and exhibit significant drug resistance. As a result, confronting and managing these infections present substantial challenges. In this study, we developed a multifunctional living phage nanoconjugate by integrating aggregation-induced emission luminogen (AIEgen) photosensitizers and nucleic acids onto a bacteriophage framework (forming MS2-DNA-AIEgen bioconjugates). These nanoconjugates can rapidly penetrate mammalian cells and specifically identify intracellular bacteria while concurrently producing a detectable fluorescent signal. By harnessing the photodynamic property of AIEgen photosensitizer and the bacteriophage's inherent targeting and lysis capability, the intracellular bacteria can be effectively eliminated and the activity of the infected cells can be restored. Moreover, our engineered phage nanoconjugates were able to expedite the healing process in bacterially infected wounds observed in diabetic mice models while simultaneously enhancing immune activity within infected cells and <i>in vivo</i>, without displaying noticeable toxicity. We envision that these multifunctional phage nanoconjugates, which utilize AIEgen photosensitizers and spherical nucleic acids, may present a groundbreaking strategy for combating intracellular bacteria and offer powerful avenues for theranostic applications in intracellular bacterial infection-associated diseases.

Rating: This abstract discusses the development of a multifunctional living phage, specifically MS2, modified with aggregation-induced emission luminogen (AIEgen) photosensitizers and nucleic acids. The study uses the phage's inherent targeting and lysis capabilities to eliminate intracellular bacteria. However, it does not specifically address modifying the MS2 phage lysis protein for it to function without binding DNAJ. Hence, while this abstract provides valuable information about the broader applications of bacteriophages in fighting multidrug resistant infections, it's not directly relevant to the specific objective of your research.

Title: Ozone and photodynamic inactivation of norovirus surrogate bacteriophage MS2 in fresh Brazilian berries and surfaces.
Abstract: This study assessed the efficacy of ozone (bubble diffusion in water; 6.25Â ppm) and photodynamic inactivation (PDT) using curcumin (75Â Î¼M) as photosensitizer (LED emission 430-470Â nm; 33.6Â mW/cm<sup>2</sup> irradiance; 16.1, 20.2, and 24.2Â J/cm<sup>2</sup> light dose) against the Norovirus surrogate bacteriophage MS2 in Brazilian berries (black mulberry and pitanga) and surfaces (glass and stainless steel). Contaminated berries and surfaces were immersed in ozonized water or exposed to PDT-curcumin for different time intervals. Transmission electron microscopy was used to assess the effects of the treatments on MS2 viral particles. The MS2 inactivation by ozone and PDT-curcumin varied with the fruit and the surface tested. Ozone reduced the MS2 titer up to 3.6 log PFU/g in black mulberry and 4.1 log PFU/g in pitanga. On surfaces, the MS2 reduction by ozone reached 3.6 and 4.8 log PFU/cm<sup>2</sup> on glass and stainless steel, respectively. PDT-curcumin reduced the MS2 3.2 and 4.8 log PFU/g in black mulberry and pitanga and 2.7 and 3.3 log PFU/cm<sup>2</sup> on glass and stainless steel, respectively. MS2 particles were disintegrated by exposure of MS2 to ozone and PDT-curcumin on pitanga. Results can contribute to establishing effective practices for controlling NoV in fruits and surfaces, estimated based on MS2 bacteriophage behavior.

Rating: While interesting, this abstract does not directly address the goal of modifying the MS2 phage lysis protein to work independently of DNAJ for phage therapy against e.coli. It rather focuses on the effect of using ozone and photodynamic inactivation with curcumin on reducing the MS2 titer in different fruits and surfaces. The study primarily offers potential advances in practices for controlling Norovirus in fruits and surfaces, not modifications of the lysis protein or phage therapy for drug-resistant e.coli. Rating: 2/10.

Title: Microplastics as potential barriers to ultraviolet light emitting diode inactivation of MS2 bacteriophage: Influence of water-quality parameters.
Abstract: Microplastics have emerged as a concerning contaminant in drinking water sources, potentially interacting with pathogenic microorganisms and affecting the disinfection processes. In this study, MS2 was selected as an alternative for the human enteric virus. The influence of microplastics polyvinylchloride (MPs-PVC) on ultraviolet light emitting diode (UV-LED) inactivation of MS2 was investigated under various water chemistry conditions, such as MPs-PVC concentration, pH, salinity, and humic acid concentration. The results revealed that higher concentrations of MPs-PVC led to the reduced inactivation of MS2 by decreased UV transmittance, hindering the disinfection process. Additionally, the inactivation efficiency of MS2 in the presence of MPs-PVC was influenced by pH, and acidic solution (pH at 4, 5, and 6) exhibited higher efficiency compared to alkaline solution (pH at 8 and 9) and neutral solution (pH at 7). The low Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations (0-50Â mM) had a noticeable effect on MS2 inaction efficiency in the presence of MPs-PVC, while the addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> posed an insignificant effect due to the preferential interaction with MPs-PVC. Furthermore, the inactivation rate of MS2 initially increased and then decreased with increasing the concentration of humic acid, which was significantly different without MPs-PVC. These findings shed light on the complex interactions between MPs-PVC and MS2 in the UV-LED disinfection process under various water-quality parameters, contributing to drinking water safety and treatment.

Rating: While this abstract provides insightful information regarding the impact of microplastics on the UV-LED inactivation of the MS2 phage, it unfortunately does not hold specific relevance to the modification of the MS2 phage lysis protein or phage therapy strategies for multidrug resistant E. coli. The research instead focuses on the effects of water quality and microplastic contamination on the disinfection processes of MS2 phages. This could perhaps be useful background information to general MS2 phage studies, but for the specific aim of eliminating the need of the lysis protein to bind DNAJ or employing the MS2 phage in therapeutic applications, this study isn't directly applicable.

Title: Insights of phytoremediation mechanisms for viruses based on in-vitro, in-vivo and in-silico assessments of selected herbal plants.
Abstract: Waterborne pathogenic viruses present unrelenting challenges to the global health and wastewater treatment industry. Phytoremediation offers promising solutions for wastewater treatment through plant-based technologies. This study investigated antiviral mechanisms in-vivo using bacteriophages MS2 and T4 as surrogates for effective herbs screened in-vitro from three embryophytes (Ocimum basilicum, Mentha sp., Plectranthus amboinicus), two macrophytes (Eichhornia crassipes, Pistia stratiotes) and a perennial grass (Cyperus rotundas). In-silico virtual screening predicted antiviral phytochemicals for further antiviral potency assessment. Results suggested in-vitro antiviral activities of embryophytes and macrophytes were higher (43-62%) than grass (21-26%). O. basilicum (OB, 57-62%) and P. stratiotes (PS, 59-60%) exhibited the highest antiviral activities. In-vivo tests showed notable virus reduction (>60%) in culture solution, attributed to rhizofiltration (66-74%) and phytoinactivation/phytodegradation (63-84%). In-silico analysis identified rutin as a primary antiviral phytochemical for MS2 (-9.7Â kcal/mol) and T4 (-10.9Â kcal/mol), correlating with dose-response inactivation (âˆ¼58-62%). In-vivo tests suggested additional phytocompounds may contribute to viral inactivation, presenting new opportunities for herb-based wastewater treatment solutions. Consequently, this study not only demonstrates the antiviral capabilities of OB and PS but also introduces an innovative approach for addressing viral contaminants in water.

Rating: While this study does involve the MS2 bacteriophage, it primarily focuses on antiviral mechanisms through phytoremediation and thus is not directly related to the goal of modifying the MS2 phage lysis protein for phage therapy in e.coli. Additionally, the study does not discuss the interaction between MS2 and DNAJ or the manipulation of MS2 for phage therapy on multidrug resistant e. coli. Therefore, despite the mention of MS2 phage, the overall content of the study is not pertinent to the specific research goal.

Title: Phage cocktail alleviated type 2 diabetes by reshaping gut microbiota and decreasing proinflammatory cytokines.
Abstract: Type 2 diabetes (T2D), a global health concern, is closely associated with the gut microbiota. Restoration of a balanced microbiota and intestinal homeostasis benefit therapy of T2D. Some special phages may selectively alter the gut microbiota without causing dysbiosis, such as MS2 and P22. However, scarcely systematic analysis of cascading effects triggered by MS2 and P22 phages on the microbiota, as well as interactions between specific gut bacteria and systemic metabolism, seriously inhibit the development of positive interventions of phages. Based on multi-omic analysis, we analyzed the intrinsic correlations among specific microbiota, their bioactive metabolites, and key indicators of T2D. We found that gavage of the MS2-P22 phage cocktail could significantly alter the gut microbiome to attenuate dysbiosis of diabetic C57BL/6 mice caused by high-fat diets (HFDs) and streptozotocin (STZ), by affecting microbial compositions as well as their metabolic pathways and metabolites, especially increasing amounts of short-chain fatty acid-producing (SCFA-producing) bacteria (e.g., Blautia and Romboutsia) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Correspondingly, a noteworthy reduction in the number of several opportunistic pathogens occurred, e.g., Candidatus Saccharimonas, Aerococcus, Oscillibacter, Desulfovibrio, and Clostridium sensu stricto 1. Synchronously, the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were reduced to recover gut barrier function in T2D mice. These findings might benefit the development of a new dietary intervention for T2D based on phage cocktails. KEY POINTS: â€¢ Intestinal barrier integrity of T2D mice is improved by a phage cocktail â€¢ Negative relationship between Muribaculaceae and Corynebacterium reshaped gut microbiota â€¢ Acetate, propionate, and butyrate decreased the level of proinflammatory factors.

Rating: This abstract discusses the use of MS2 phage in potentially treating Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) by altering the gut microbiota and reducing inflammation, which can be helpful for further understanding the role and potential therapeutic functions of the MS2 phage. However, it does not specifically discuss the modifying of the MS2 phage lysis protein for the purpose of not binding to DNAJ, or using MS2 phage in phage therapy on multidrug resistant e. coli. Thus, the information, while related to MS2 phage and its possible therapeutic uses, does not directly relate to the research goal stated.

Title: The use of plant extracts and bacteriophages as an alternative therapy approach in combatting bacterial infections: the study of lytic phages and <i>Stevia rebaudiana</i>.
Abstract: In the light of the problem of antibiotic resistance, the use of combined alternative therapies in combatting bacteria-related disorders has gained popularity. Bacteriophages are one element implemented in new combination therapy. <i>Stevia rebaudiana</i> is known to have antimicrobial activity and regarded as potentially having a synergistic effect with bacteriophages. Therefore, possible interactions of lytic bacteriophages (MS2, T4 and Phi6) with acetone and methanol <i>S. rebaudiana</i> extracts (SRa and SRm) in the bacterial environment were examined.

Rating: This abstract discusses the use of bacteriophages, including MS2, in combination therapy and their interactions with <i>S. rebaudiana</i> extracts. While this does pertain to bacteriophages and their use in therapy against bacterial infections, it does not specifically discuss the modification of the MS2 phage lysis protein or its interaction with DNAJ that would make it specific to the research goal. As such, it is somewhat relevant but not closely focused. Therefore, Rating: 3/10.

Title: Approaching easy water disinfection for all: Can in situ electrochlorination outperform conventional chlorination under realistic conditions?
Abstract: Electrochlorination has gained research interest for its potential application as decentralized water treatment. A number of studies have displayed promising efficiency for water disinfection. However, a comprehensive comparison of in situ electrodisinfection to existing disinfection techniques, particularly under realistic water composition and flow rates, still needs additional research efforts. The aim of this study is to evaluate in situ electrochlorination while comparing the treatment with conventional chemical chlorination for point-of-entry decentralized disinfection at the household level. An electrochemical flow cell reactor was operated in a single pass mode considering water flow and water consumption for a household of four family members. Disinfection efficiency assessment of both electrochemical and chemical chlorination was conducted using bacterial and viral surrogates, E. coli and MS2 bacteriophage. Furthermore, a techno-economic analysis was conducted, using the levelized cost of water, to compare two electrochemical chlorination scenarios (i.e., electrical grid energy use, and solar panel powered system) and benchmarked against the baseline treatment of chemical chlorination. The findings revealed increased inactivation efficiency of in situ electrochlorination over conventional chlorination (p-value < 0.05). The synergetic impact of radicals and chlorine, and/or contribution of high chlorine concentration at acidic pH near anode surface were identified as key factors that could enhance disinfection performance of in situ electrochlorination. The techno-economic analysis demonstrated that electrochemical treatment, when operated using renewable energy sources, is not only a more environmentally sustainable approach, but also emerges as a more economically feasible solution for decentralized water treatment application. The results highlight that in situ electrochlorination is a more advanced alternative to decentralized water chlorination. However, further fundamental research on products and by-products formation under various water matrices is required.

Rating: While this abstract does mention the MS2 bacteriophage and its effectiveness in disinfection, it does not focus on modifying the MS2 phage lysis protein or the relationship with DNAJ. The goal of this research is more aligned with improving water disinfection methods, not developing phage therapy for multidrug resistant E. coli. Therefore, I would rate this abstract as relatively low in relevance to the stated goal.

Title: One-plasmid double-expression system for preparation of MS2 virus-like particles packaging SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
Abstract: COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus named SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus. Reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assays are the gold standard molecular test for detection of RNA viruses. The aim of this study was to construct an RNA-positive control based on MS2 phage-like particles (MS2 VLPs) to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA. pCDFDuet-1 was used as a one-plasmid double-expression system to construct MS2 VLPs containing ssRNA of SARS-CoV-2. The sequence encoding one copy of maturase, His-tag and coat protein dimer was cloned and inserted into MCS1 of the plasmid; the fragment encoding protein N and ORF1ab from SARS-CoV-2 was cloned and inserted into MCS2. The prepared plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL2 (DE3), and expression of the construct was induced by 1 mM isopropyl-L-thio-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) at 30Â°C for 12 hours. MS2 VLPs were purified and collected with Ni-NTA affinity chromatography columns. The size and shape of the MS2 VLPs were verified by transmission electron microscopy, and the stability of MS2 VLP packaged RNA was evaluated by treatment with RNase A. Effects of storage temperature and buffer on MS2 VLP stability were also investigated. The results showed that SARS-CoV-2 MS2 VLPs could be successfully produced by this one-plasmid double-expression system. MS2 VLPs showed high stability and may be used as a positive control in molecular diagnosis of COVID-19.

Rating: This abstract primarily discusses the utilization of MS2 phage-like particles in the construction of a positive-control for detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the context of COVID-19 diagnosis, rather than modification of the MS2 phage lysis protein or phage therapy against multidrug-resistant E. coli. Therefore, it's not highly relevant to the stated research objectives.

Title: Implementation of a Sensitive Method to Assess High Virus Retention Performance of Low-Pressure Reverse Osmosis Process.
Abstract: Human enteric viruses are important etiological agents of waterborne diseases. Environmental waters are usually contaminated with low virus concentration requiring large concentration factors for effective detection by (RT)-qPCR. Low-pressure reverse osmosis is often used to remove water contaminants, but very few studies focused on the effective virus removal of reverse osmosis treatment with feed concentrations as close as possible to environmental concentrations and principally relied on theoretical virus removal. The very low viral concentrations usually reported in the permeates (i.e. at least 5 log of removal rate) mean that very large volumes of water need to be analysed to have sufficient sensitivity and assess the process efficiency. This study evaluates two methods for the concentration of adenoviruses, enteroviruses and MS2 bacteriophages at different viral concentrations in large (<â€‰200 L) and very large (>â€‰200 L) volumes. The first method is composed of two ultrafiltration membranes with low-molecular weight cut-offs while the second method primarily relies on adsorption and elution phases using electropositive-charged filters. The recovery rates were assessed for both methods. For the ultrafiltration-based protocol, recovery rates were similar for each virus studied: 80% on average at high virus concentrations (10<sup>6</sup>-10<sup>7</sup> viruses L<sup>-1</sup>) and 50% at low virus concentrations (10<sup>3</sup>-10<sup>4</sup> viruses L<sup>-1</sup>). For the electropositive-charged filter-based method, the average recoveries obtained were about 36% for ADV 41, 57% for CV-B5 and 1.6% for MS2. The ultrafiltration-based method was then used to evaluate the performance of a low-pressure reverse osmosis lab-scale pilot plant. The retentions by reverse osmosis were similar for all studied viruses and the validated recovery rates applied to the system confirmed the reliability of the concentration method. This method was effective in concentrating all three viruses over a wide range of viral concentrations. Moreover, the second concentration method using electropositive-charged filters was studied, allowing the filtration of larger volumes of permeate from a semi-industrial low-pressure reverse osmosis pilot plant. This reference method was used because of the inability of the UF method to filter volumes on the order of one cubic metre.

Rating: While this abstract discusses MS2 bacteriophages, it is not directly relevant to the goal of modifying the MS2 phage lysis protein for the purpose of phage therapy on multidrug resistant e. coli. Instead, it focuses on methods to concentrate various viruses, including MS2 bacteriophages, in water samples for purposes of assessing the efficiency of a low-pressure reverse osmosis system.

Title: Droplet-based methodology for investigating bacterial population dynamics in response to phage exposure.
Abstract: An alarming rise in antimicrobial resistance worldwide has spurred efforts into the search for alternatives to antibiotic treatments. The use of bacteriophages, bacterial viruses harmless to humans, represents a promising approach with potential to treat bacterial infections (phage therapy). Recent advances in microscopy-based single-cell techniques have allowed researchers to develop new quantitative methodologies for assessing the interactions between bacteria and phages, especially the ability of phages to eradicate bacterial pathogen populations and to modulate growth of both commensal and pathogen populations. Here we combine droplet microfluidics with fluorescence time-lapse microscopy to characterize the growth and lysis dynamics of the bacterium <i>Escherichia coli</i> confined in droplets when challenged with phage. We investigated phages that promote lysis of infected <i>E. coli</i> cells, specifically, a phage species with DNA genome, T7 (<i>Escherichia virus T7</i>) and two phage species with RNA genomes, MS2 (<i>Emesvirus zinderi</i>) and QÎ² (<i>Qubevirus durum</i>). Our microfluidic trapping device generated and immobilized picoliter-sized droplets, enabling stable imaging of bacterial growth and lysis in a temperature-controlled setup. Temporal information on bacterial population size was recorded for up to 25â€‰h, allowing us to determine growth rates of bacterial populations and helping us uncover the extent and speed of phage infection. In the long-term, the development of novel microfluidic single-cell and population-level approaches will expedite research towards fundamental understanding of the genetic and molecular basis of rapid phage-induced lysis and eco-evolutionary aspects of bacteria-phage dynamics, and ultimately help identify key factors influencing the success of phage therapy.

Rating: This abstract is quite relevant as it discusses the interaction between bacteriophages and E. coli, and specifically mentions the MS2 phage in the context of phage therapy. However, it does not address the modification of the MS2 phage lysis protein so it does not need to bind DNAJ. Based on these factors, I would rate its relevance as 7/10.

Title: RNA Aptamer-Mediated Gene Activation Systems for Inducible Transgene Expression in Animal Cells.
Abstract: RNA expression analyses can be used to obtain various information from inside cells, such as physical conditions, the chemical environment, and endogenous signals. For detecting RNA, the system regulating intracellular gene expression has the potential for monitoring RNA expression levels in real time within living cells. Synthetic biology provides powerful tools for detecting and analyzing RNA inside cells. Here, we devised an RNA aptamer-mediated gene activation system, RAMGA, to induce RNA-triggered gene expression activation by employing an inducible complex formation strategy grounded in synthetic biology. This methodology connects DNA-binding domains and transactivators through target RNA using RNA-binding domains, including phage coat proteins. MS2 bacteriophage coat protein fused with a transcriptional activator and PP7 bacteriophage coat protein fused with the tetracycline repressor (tetR) can be bridged by target RNA encoding MS2 and PP7 stem-loops, resulting in transcriptional activation. We generated recombinant CHO cells containing an inducible GFP expression module governed by a minimal promoter with a tetR-responsive element. Cells carrying the trigger RNA exhibited robust reporter gene expression, whereas cells lacking it exhibited no expression. GFP expression was upregulated over 200-fold compared with that in cells without a target RNA expression vector. Moreover, this system can detect the expression of mRNA tagged with aptamer tags and modulate reporter gene expression based on the target mRNA level without affecting the expression of the original mRNA-encoding gene. The RNA-triggered gene expression systems developed in this study have potential as a new platform for establishing gene circuits, evaluating endogenous gene expression, and developing novel RNA detectors.

Rating: This abstract is only partially relevant to the goal of using the MS2 phage in phage therapy on multidrug resistant e. coli. It does discuss the manipulation of MS2 phage coat proteins, but this is done in the context of tracking RNA expression inside cells, not specifically about modifying MS2 phage lysis protein so it does not need to bind DNAJ. The research could perhaps inform a different approach to the stated research aim, but it is not directly relevant. Therefore, the relevance rating would be 5/10.

Title: <i>In vitro</i> characterization of the phage lysis protein MS2-L.
Abstract: <b>Background:</b> The peptide MS2-L represents toxins of the ssRNA Leviviridae phage family and consists of a predicted N-terminal soluble domain followed by a transmembrane domain. MS2-L mediates bacterial cell lysis through the formation of large lesions in the cell envelope, but further details of this mechanism as a prerequisite for applied bioengineering studies are lacking. The chaperone DnaJ is proposed to modulate MS2-L activity, whereas other cellular targets of MS2-L are unknown. <b>Methods:</b> Here, we provide a combined <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> overexpression approach to reveal molecular insights into MS2-L action and its interaction with DnaJ. Full-length MS2-L and truncated derivatives were synthesized cell-free and co-translationally inserted into nanodiscs or solubilized in detergent micelles. By native liquid bead ion desorption mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that MS2-L assembles into high oligomeric states after membrane insertion. <b>Results:</b> Oligomerization is directed by the transmembrane domain and is impaired in detergent environments. Studies with truncated MS2-L derivatives provide evidence that the soluble domain acts as a modulator of oligomer formation. DnaJ strongly interacts with MS2-L in membranes as well as in detergent environments. However, this interaction affects neither the MS2-L membrane insertion efficiency nor its oligomerization in nanodisc membranes. In accordance with the in vitro data, the assembly of MS2-L derivatives into large membrane located clusters was monitored by overexpression of corresponding fusions with fluorescent monitors in <i>E. coli</i> cells. Analysis by cryo-electron microscopy indicates that lesion formation is initiated in the outer membrane, followed by disruption of the peptidoglycan layer and disintegration of the inner membrane. <b>Conclusion:</b> MS2-L forms oligomeric complexes similar to the related phage toxin Î¦X174-E. The oligomeric interface of both peptides is located within their transmembrane domains. We propose a potential function of the higher-order assembly of small phage toxins in membrane disintegration and cell lysis.

Rating: This abstract is extremely relevant to the overall goal of modifying the MS2 phage for use in phage therapy on multidrug resistant E. coli. It provides detailed information on the function of the MS2-L peptide, its interaction with DnaJ chaperone and its role in bacterial cell lysis. It also indicates that the interaction with chaperone DnaJ does not affect the MS2-L membrane insertion efficiency nor its oligomerization. Thus, it provides necessary information for understanding and eventually modifying the MS2 phage's properties so it is less dependent on DnaJ. The proposed function of the higher-order assembly in membrane disintegration and cell lysis is particularly critical for further research into phage therapy. Rating: 10/10

Title: Partitioning and inactivation of enveloped and nonenveloped viruses in activated sludge, anaerobic and microalgae-based wastewater treatment systems.
Abstract: Anaerobic and microalgae-based technologies for municipal wastewater treatment have emerged as sustainable alternatives to activated sludge systems. However, viruses are a major sanitary concern for reuse applications of liquid and solid byproducts from these technologies. To assess their capacity to reduce viruses during secondary wastewater treatment, enveloped Phi6 and nonenveloped MS2 bacteriophages, typically used as surrogates of several types of wastewater viruses, were spiked into batch bioreactors treating synthetic municipal wastewater (SMWW). The decay of Phi6 and MS2 in anaerobic and microalgae-based reactors was compared with the decay in activated sludge batch reactors for 96Â h (Phi6) and 144Â h (MS2). In each reactor, bacteriophages in the soluble and solids fractions were titered, allowing the assessment of virus partitioning to biomass over time. Moreover, the influence of abiotic conditions such as agitation, oxygen absence and light excess in activated sludge, anaerobic and microalgae reactors, respectively, was assessed using dedicated SMWW control reactors. All technologies showed Phi6 and MS2 reductions. Phi6 was reduced in at least 4.7 to 6.5 log<sub>10</sub> units, with 0Â h concentrations ranging from 5.0 to 6.5 log<sub>10</sub> PFU mL<sup>-1</sup>. Similarly, reductions achieved for MS2 were of at least 3.9 to 7.2 log<sub>10</sub> units, from starting concentrations of 8.0 to 8.6 log<sub>10</sub> PFU mL<sup>-1</sup>. Log-logistic models adjusted to bacteriophages' decay indicated T<sub>90</sub> values in activated sludge and microalgae reactors of 2.2 and 7.9Â h for Phi6 and of 1.0 and 11.5Â h for MS2, respectively, all within typical hydraulic retention times (HRT) of full-scale operation. In the case of the microalgae technology, T<sub>99</sub> values for Phi6 and MS2 of 12.7Â h and 13.6Â h were also lower than typical operating HRTs (2-10 d), while activated sludge and anaerobic treatment achieved less than 99Â % of Phi6 and 50Â % of MS2 inactivation within 12Â h of typical HRT, respectively. Thus, the microalgae-based treatment exhibited a higher potential to reduce the disinfection requirements of treated wastewater.

Rating: While the abstract provides valuable information on the use of nonenveloped MS2 bacteriophages in wastewater treatment bioreactors, it does not address the goal of using the MS2 phage in phage therapy on multidrug resistant E. coli. In particular, it does not discuss modifying the MS2 phage lysis protein so that it does not need to bind DNAJ. Therefore, this abstract is not relevant to the research goal.

Title: Bacteriophage Virus-Like Particles: Platforms for Vaccine Design.
Abstract: Virus-like particles (VLPs) derived from bacteriophages have many applications in biomedical sciences, especially in the development of candidate vaccines against viral and bacterial infections. Bacteriophage VLPs can be manufactured cheaply and in large quantities in bacteria compared to eukaryotic expression systems. In addition to this, bacteriophage VLPs are excellent platforms for vaccine design for the following reason: Humans do not have preexisting antibodies against bacteriophage VLPs. Thus, antigens displayed on bacteriophage VLP platforms are expected to be highly immunogenic. As such, VLPs derived from MS2, PP7, QÎ², AP205, P22 bacteriophages, etc. have been used to develop candidate vaccines against human infectious and noninfectious agents. This mini-review summarizes data from some of the candidate bacteriophage-based VLP peptide vaccines that have been developed. The review also highlights some strategies used to develop the candidate bacteriophage-based VLP peptide vaccines.

Rating: While this abstract discusses the advantages and potential applications of VLPs, including MS2 bacteriophage, particularly in the field of vaccine development, it does not directly focus on the modification of MS2 phage lysis protein or its potential use in phage therapy against multidrug-resistant E. coli. Therefore, its relevance to the specific research goal is moderate to low.

Title: Physiological characterization of single gene lysis proteins.
Abstract: Until recently only 11 distinct Sgls (single gene lysis proteins) have been experimentally identified. Of these, three have been shown to be specific inhibitors of different steps in the pathway that supplies Lipid II to the peptidoglycan (PG) biosynthesis machinery: QÎ² A<sub>2</sub> inhibits MurA, Ï•X174 E inhibits MraY, and Lys from coliphage M inhibits MurJ. These Sgls have been called "protein antibiotics" because the lytic event is a septal catastrophe indistinguishable from that caused by cell wall antibiotics. Here we propose to designate these as members of type I Sgls, to distinguish them from another Sgl, the L protein of the paradigm ssRNA phage MS2. Although none of the other distinct Sgls have significant sequence similarity to L, alignments suggested the presence of four domains distinguished by hydrophobic and polar character. The simplest notion is that these other Sgls have the same autolytic mechanism and, based on this, constitute type II. Although the number of experimentally confirmed Sgls has not changed, recent environmental metagenomes and metatranscriptomes have revealed thousands of new ssRNA phage genomes, each of which presumably has at least one Sgl gene. Here we report on methods to distinguish type I and type II Sgls. Using phase-contrast microscopy, we show that both classes of Sgls cause the formation of blebs prior to lysis, but the location of the blebs differs significantly. In addition, we show that L and other type II Sgls do not inhibit net synthesis of PG, as measured by incorporation of <sup>3</sup>[H]-diaminopimelic acid. Finally, we provide support for the unexpected finding by Adler and colleagues that the Sgl from Pseudomonas phage PP7 is a type I Sgl, as determined by the two methods. This shows that the sharing the putative 4-domain structure suggested for L is not a reliable discriminator for operational characterization of Sgls. Overall, this study establishes new ways to rapidly classify novel Sgls and thus may facilitate the identification of new cell envelope targets that will help generate new antibiotics.

Rating: This abstract presents a clear relevance to the subject of phage therapy and the possibilities of modifying the lysis protein associated with the MS2 phage. It explores the classification of single gene lysis proteins (Sgls) and contrasts different types, with specific focus on the L protein of the MS2 phage. Despite no methodological approach revealed to modify the phageâ€™s necessity to bind DNAJ, it offers potential insights into how to categorize and study different lysis proteins, which could be instrumental in developing antibacterial agents against multidrug resistant E. coli. While it offers indirect relevance to the original research goal, the focus is not exclusively on the modification of the MS2 phage lysis protein and its interaction with DNAJ. Rating: 6/10.

Title: Complete Virion Simulated: All-Atom Model of an MS2 Bacteriophage with Native Genome.
Abstract: For the first time, a complete all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) model of a virus, bacteriophage MS2, in its entirety, including a protein outer shell, native genomic RNA with necessary divalent ions, and surrounding explicit aqueous solution with ions at physiological concentration, was built. The model is based on an experimentally measured cryo-EM structure, which was substantially augmented by reconstructing missing or low-resolution parts of the measured density (where the atomistic structure cannot be fit unambiguously). The model was tested by a quarter of a microsecond MD run, and various biophysical characteristics are obtained and analyzed. The developed methodology of building the model can be used for reconstructing other large biomolecular structures when experimental data are fragmented and/or of varying resolution, while the model itself can be used for studying the biology of MS2, including the dynamics of its interaction with the host bacteria.

Rating: This abstract provides valuable information regarding the construction of an all-atom model of the MS2 bacteriophage, including testing and biophysical analyses. However, it does not address the specific goal of the modification of the MS2 phage lysis protein, or its binding with DNAJ nor is it pertaining to its use in phage therapy against multidrug-resistant E. coli. However, the techniques described may be beneficial to future studies advancing the understanding of the MS2 bacteriophage structure and interactions. Given the indirect relevance, I would rate this abstract as a 3/10 for relevance to the specific research goal.

Title: An Approach for Antigen-Agnostic Identification of Virus-Like Particle-Displayed Epitopes that Engage Specific Antibody V Gene Regions.
Abstract: Antibody complementarity determining regions (CDRs) participate in antigen recognition, but not all participate equally in antigen binding. Here we describe a technique for discovering strong, specific binding partners to defined motifs within the CDRs of chimeric, engineered antibodies using affinity selection and counter-selection of epitopes displayed on bacteriophage MS2-based virus-like particles (VLPs). As an example, we show how this technique can be used to identify families of VLPs that interact with antibodies displaying the CDRs encoded by the germline precursor of a broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody against HIV-1.

Rating: This abstract does mention the bacteriophage MS2, however its context is more relative to antibody-antigen interactions and HIV-1, rather than E. coli or the modification of MS2 phage lysis proteins to bind without the need of DNAJ. Thus, it is not highly relevant to the stated research goals. Rating: 2/10.

Title: Performance comparison of photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy with visible-light-activated organic dyes: Rose bengal, crystal violet, methylene blue, and toluidine blue O.
Abstract: This study evaluated the photobiocidal performance of four widely distributed visible-light-activated (VLA) dyes against two bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli) and two bacteriophages (phages MS2 and phi 6): rose bengal (RB), crystal violet, methylene blue, and toluidine blue O (TBO). The photobiocidal performance of each dye depended on the relationship between the type of dye and microorganism. Gram-negative E. coli and the non-enveloped structure of phage MS2 showed more resistance to the photobiocidal reaction than Gram-positive S. epidermidis and the enveloped structure of phage phi 6. RB had the highest potential to yield reactive oxygen species. However, the photobiocidal performance of RB was dependent on the magnitude of the surface charge of the microorganisms; for example, anionic RB induced a negative surface charge and thus electrical repulsion. On the other hand, the photobiocidal performance of TBO was observed to be less affected by the microorganism type. The comparative results presented in our study have significant implications for selecting photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy (PACT) dyes suitable for specific situations and purposes. Furthermore, they contribute to the advancement of PACT-related technologies by enhancing their applicability and scalability.

Rating: This abstract largely relates to the photobiocidal performance of various dyes as antimicrobial agents and not on the modification of the MS2 phage lysis protein to eliminate the need for DNAJ binding. The mention of MS2 phage in this study is about its resistance to the photobiocidal reaction and not regarding its genetic modifications for phage therapy. Therefore, while the abstract might hold some relevance in the broader field of antimicrobial therapies, it's not directly pertinent to the goal mentioned. Rating: 2/10.

Title: Positive interactions among Corynebacterium glutamicum and keystone bacteria producing SCFAs benefited T2D mice to rebuild gut eubiosis.
Abstract: Accumulating evidences strongly support the correlations between the compositions of gut microbiome and therapeutic effects on Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Notably, gut microbes such as Akkermansia muciniphila are found able to regulate microecological balance and alleviate dysmetabolism of mice bearing T2D. In order to search out similarly functional bacteria, bacteriophage MS2 with a good specificity to bacteria carrying fertility (F) factor were used to treat T2D mice. Based on multi-omics analysis of microbiome and global metabolism of mice, we observed that gavage of bacteriophage MS2 and metformin led to a significant increase in the abundance of Corynebacterium glutamicum and A. muciniphila, respectively. Consequently, the gut microbiota were remodeled, leading to variations in metabolites and a substantial increase in short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). In which, the amount of acetate, propionate, and butyrate presented negative correlations to that of proinflammatory cytokines, which was beneficial to repairing the intestinal barriers and improving their functions. Moreover, main short fatty acid (SCFA) producers exhibited positive interactions, further facilitating the restoration of gut eubiosis. These findings revealed that C. glutamicum and its metabolites may be potential dietary supplements for the treatment of T2D. Moreover, our research contributes to a novel understanding of the underlying mechanism by which functional foods exert their anti-diabetic effects.

Rating: While this abstract describes a study involving the MS2 bacteriophage and its impact on gut microbiota and its potential therapeutic effects, it doesn't specifically talk about any induction of lysis in multidrug-resistant E. coli or editing the lysis protein for independence from DNAJ. The focus appears to be utilizing MS2 as a tool in reshaping microbiome composition for metabolic diseases (like T2D), instead of direct phage therapy for multidrug-resistant bacteria. Therefore, this abstract doesn't have a high relevance to the specific goal stated. Rating: 3/10.

Title: The Protective Effect of Virus Capsids on RNA and DNA Virus Genomes in Wastewater.
Abstract: Virus concentrations measured in municipal wastewater help inform both the water treatment necessary to protect human health and wastewater-based epidemiology. Wastewater measurements are typically PCR-based, and interpreting gene copy concentrations requires an understanding of the form and stability of the nucleic acids. Here, we study the persistence of model virus genomes in wastewater, the protective effects provided by the virus capsids, and the relative decay rates of the genome and infectious viruses. In benchtop batch experiments in wastewater influent at 25 Â°C, extraviral (+)ssRNA and dsDNA amplicons degraded by 90% within 15-19 min and 1.6-1.9 h, respectively. When encapsidated, the <i>T</i><sub>90</sub> for MS2 (+)ssRNA increased by 424Ã— and the <i>T</i><sub>90</sub> for T4 dsDNA increased by 52Ã—. The (+)ssRNA decay rates were similar for a range of amplicon sizes. For our model phages MS2 and T4, the nucleic acid signal in untreated wastewater disappeared shortly after the viruses lost infectivity. Combined, these results suggest that most viral genome copies measured in wastewater are encapsidated, that measured concentrations are independent of assay amplicon sizes, and that the virus genome decay rates of nonenveloped (i.e., naked) viruses are similar to inactivation rates. These findings are valuable for the interpretation of wastewater virus measurements.

Rating: While this abstract discusses the stability of MS2 (+)ssRNA in wastewater and the protective effects provided by the virus capsids, it does not provide specific information on modifying the MS2 phage lysis protein or its possible use in phage therapy against multidrug-resistant e. coli. Thus, it's not highly relevant to the specific goal of the research. Rating: 2/10.

Title: Fluence requirements in existing UV disinfection facilities to comply with EU validation performance targets for reclaimed water: a case study.
Abstract: Since 2020, there is a new European Regulation (EU, 2020/741) on minimum requirements for water reuse, where routine and validation monitoring requirements (log reductions of indicator microorganisms and reference pathogens) have been established. Many reclamation facilities that are already in operation might have difficulties to comply with these performance targets. Existing disinfection systems must be expanded and upgraded. In the case of UV disinfection systems, fluence requirements must be determined to properly design with a focus on the safety and economic-environmental viability of reclaimed water. This study can be used as a reference to develop fluence-response curves for Clostridium perfringens spores, Escherichia coli, and total and F-specific coliphages, indicator microorganisms referred to in the new European Regulation. Eight UV-LED collimated beam tests were performed. Samples were obtained from filtered effluent of secondary treatment from two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) which ranged between 30 and 54%. Results showed UV sensitivity of 33.46 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> log I for C. perfringens spores and 2.86 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> log I for E. coli, both from environmental origin. Coliphages were inactivated below the limit of quantitation. The non-dominance of MS2 phages in environmental F-specific coliphages was observed.

Rating: While this abstract does discuss antibacterial treatments and specifically mentions E. coli, it does not specifically discuss the use of the MS2 phage, its lysis protein, its DNAJ interaction, nor the potential use of phage therapy. Multidrug resistance of E. coli is also not mentioned specifically. Therefore, this abstract is not highly relevant to the specified goal.

Title: Adsorption of Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Rhinovirus, SARS-CoV-2, and F+ Bacteriophage MS2 RNA onto Wastewater Solids from Raw Wastewater.
Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of wastewater surveillance, more research is needed to understand the fate and transport of viral genetic markers in wastewater. This information is essential for optimizing monitoring strategies and interpreting wastewater surveillance data. In this study, we examined the solid-liquid partitioning behavior of four viruses in wastewater: SARS-CoV-2, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), and F+ coliphage/MS2. We used two approaches: (1) laboratory partitioning experiments using lab-grown viruses and (2) distribution experiments using endogenous viruses in raw wastewater. Partition experiments were conducted at 4 and 22 Â°C. Wastewater samples were spiked with varying concentrations of each virus, solids and liquids were separated via centrifugation, and viral RNA concentrations were quantified using reverse-transcription-digital droplet PCR (RT-ddPCR). For the distribution experiments, wastewater samples were collected from six wastewater treatment plants and processed without spiking exogenous viruses; viral RNA concentrations were measured in wastewater solids and liquids. In both experiments, RNA concentrations were higher in the solid fraction than the liquid fraction by approximately 3-4 orders of magnitude. Partition coefficients (<i>K</i><sub>F</sub>) ranged from 2000-270,000 mLÂ·g<sup>-1</sup> across viruses and temperature conditions. Distribution coefficients (<i>K</i><sub>d</sub>) were consistent with results from partitioning experiments. Further research is needed to understand how virus and wastewater characteristics might influence the partitioning of viral genetic markers in wastewater.

Rating: While this abstract discusses the behavior of the MS2 phage in wastewater, it does not directly pertain to the goal of modifying the MS2 phage lysis protein for phage therapy on multidrug resistant E. coli. It does not mention DNAJ binding or specific applications in phage therapy. Therefore, this paper's relevance is low. Rating: 2/10.

Title: Geochemical constraints on bacteriophage infectivity in terrestrial environments.
Abstract: Lytic phages can be potent and selective inhibitors of microbial growth and can have profound impacts on microbiome composition and function. However, there is uncertainty about the biogeochemical conditions under which phage predation modulates microbial ecosystem function, particularly in terrestrial systems. Ionic strength is critical for infection of bacteria by many phages, but quantitative data is limited on the ion thresholds for phage infection that can be compared with environmental ion concentrations. Similarly, while carbon composition varies in the environment, we do not know how this variability influences the impact of phage predation on microbiome function. Here, we measured the half-maximal effective concentrations (EC<sub>50</sub>) of 80 different inorganic ions for the infection of E. coli with two canonical dsDNA and ssRNA phages, T4 and MS2, respectively. Many alkaline earth metals and alkali metals enabled lytic infection but the ionic strength thresholds varied for different ions between phages. Additionally, using a freshwater nitrate-reducing microbiome, we found that the ability of lytic phages to influence nitrate reduction end-products depended upon the carbon source as well as ionic strength. For all phage:host pairs, the ion EC<sub>50</sub>s for phage infection exceeded the ion concentrations found in many terrestrial freshwater systems. Thus, our findings support a model where phages most influence terrestrial microbial functional ecology in hot spots and hot moments such as metazoan guts, drought influenced soils, or biofilms where ion concentration is locally or transiently elevated and nutrients are available to support the growth of specific phage hosts.

Rating: While this abstract provides insightful information on the conditions under which phages, notably the MS2 phage, infect E.coli, it does not address the specific objective of modifying the MS2 phage lysis protein to avoid DNAJ binding. Therefore, the abstract sheds some light on factors that may influence the overall use of the MS2 phage in phage therapy but does not directly relate to the goal at hand. Rating: 4/10.

Title: In situ generation of cold atmospheric plasma-activated mist and its biocidal activity against surrogate viruses for COVID-19.
Abstract: To provide an alternative to ultra violet light and vapourized hydrogen peroxide to enhance decontamination of surfaces as part of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Rating: This abstract is not relevant to the goal of using the MS2 phage in phage therapy on multidrug resistant e. coli. The abstract discusses methods of decontamination in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, not manipulation of the MS2 phage lysis protein. Rating: 0/10.

Title: Antiviral activity of copper contact surfaces against MS2 coliphage and hepatitis a virus.
Abstract: Viral diseases can be indirectly transmitted by contaminated non-food contact surfaces to final food products by cross-contamination. The interaction of metal surfaces and viruses, MS2 coliphage and hepatitis A virus (HAV), was investigated for strategy development in decreasing this transmission risk.

Rating: This abstract does not seem directly relevant to the goal of modifying MS2 phage lysis protein or using the MS2 phage in phage therapy on multidrug resistant E. coli. It rather discusses the transmission risk of viruses via metal surfaces, a distinct topic. Therefore, I would rate it as 1/10 for relevance.

Title: Investigating the Prevalence of RNA-Binding Metabolic Enzymes in <i>E. coli</i>.
Abstract: An open research field in cellular regulation is the assumed crosstalk between RNAs, metabolic enzymes, and metabolites, also known as the REM hypothesis. High-throughput assays have produced extensive interactome data with metabolic enzymes frequently found as hits, but only a few examples have been biochemically validated, with deficits especially in prokaryotes. Therefore, we rationally selected nineteen <i>Escherichia coli</i> enzymes from such datasets and examined their ability to bind RNAs using two complementary methods, iCLIP and SELEX. Found interactions were validated by EMSA and other methods. For most of the candidates, we observed no RNA binding (12/19) or a rather unspecific binding (5/19). Two of the candidates, namely glutamate-5-kinase (ProB) and quinone oxidoreductase (QorA), displayed specific and previously unknown binding to distinct RNAs. We concentrated on the interaction of QorA to the mRNA of <i>yffO</i>, a grounded prophage gene, which could be validated by EMSA and MST. Because the physiological function of both partners is not known, the biological relevance of this interaction remains elusive. Furthermore, we found novel RNA targets for the MS2 phage coat protein that served us as control. Our results indicate that RNA binding of metabolic enzymes in procaryotes is less frequent than suggested by the results of high-throughput studies, but does occur.

Rating: The abstract is partially relevant to the goal of using the MS2 phage in phage therapy on multidrug resistant e. coli, as it mentions the MS2 phage coat protein and its novel RNA targets. However, no direct information is provided about modifying the MS2 phage lysis protein, or about its requirement of binding to DNAJ. Therefore the relevance is limited. Rating: 4/10.

Title: Evaluation of disinfection methods for personal protective equipment (PPE) items for reuse during a pandemic.
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in many supply chain issues, including crippling of essential personal protective equipment (PPE) needed for high-risk occupations such as those in healthcare. As a result of these supply chain issues, unprecedented crisis capacity strategies were implemented to divert PPE items such as filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs, namely N95s) to those who needed them most for protection. Large-scale methods for decontamination were used throughout the world to preserve these items and provided for their extended use. The general public also adopted the use of non-specialized protective equipment such as face coverings. So, the need for cleaning, decontamination, or disinfection of these items in addition to normal clothing items became a necessary reality. Some items could be laundered, but other items were not appropriate for washing/drying. To fill research gaps in small-scale, non-commercial cleaning and disinfection, this bench-scale research was conducted using small coupons (swatches) of multiple PPE/barrier protection materials inoculated with virus (non-pathogenic bacteriophages Phi6 and MS2) and tested against a range of decontamination methods including bleach-, alcohol- and quaternary ammonium compound (QAC)-based liquid sprays, as well as low concentration hydrogen peroxide vapor (LCHPV) and bench-scale laundering. In general, non-porous items were easier to disinfect than porous items, and the enveloped virus Phi6 was overall easier to inactivate than MS2. Multiple disinfection methods were shown to be effective in reducing viral loads from PPE coupons, though only laundering and LCHPV were effective for all materials tested that were inoculated with Phi6. Applications of this and follow-on full-scale research are to provide simple effective cleaning/disinfection methods for use during the current and future pandemics.

Rating: The abstract discusses the use of MS2 bacteriophage in the context of PPE cleaning and disinfection, not in terms of its therapeutic potential against multidrug-resistant E. coli or its lysis protein modifications. The information provided is interesting from an infection control perspective but does not contribute significantly to theistic research goals regarding the modification of MS2 phage lysis protein for phage therapy. Therefore, the relevance of this abstract to the stated research goal is quite low.

Title: Magnetic Levitation System Isolates and Purifies Airborne Viruses.
Abstract: Detection of viable viruses in the air is critical in order to determine the level of risk associated with the airborne diffusion of viruses. Different methods have been developed for the isolation, purification, and detection of viable airborne viruses, but they require an extensive processing time and often present limitations including low physical efficiency (i.e., the amount of collected viruses), low biological efficiency (i.e., the number of viable viruses), or a combination of all. To mitigate such limitations, we have employed an efficient technique based on the magnetic levitation (Maglev) technique with a paramagnetic solution and successfully identified distinct variations in levitation and density characteristics among bacteria (<i>Escherichia coli</i>), phages (MS2), and human viruses (SARS-CoV-2 and influenza H1N1). Notably, the Maglev approach enabled a significant enrichment of viable airborne viruses in air samples. Furthermore, the enriched viruses obtained through Maglev exhibited high purity, rendering them suitable for direct utilization in subsequent analyses such as reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or colorimetric assays. The system is portable, easy to use, and cost-efficient and can potentially provide proactive surveillance data for monitoring future outbreaks of airborne infectious diseases and allow for the induction of various preventative and mitigative measures.

Rating: While the abstract provides valuable information on the isolation, purification, and detection of MS2 phages in the air, it does not focus on the modification of the MS2 phage lysis protein so that it doesn't require DNAJ binding or on the potential use of the MS2 phage in phage therapy against multi-drug resistant E. coli. Therefore, it is not directly relevant to the specific goal of the research.

Title: Streamlined Data Analysis Pipeline for Deep Sequence-Coupled Biopanning Identification of Pathogen-Specific Antibody Responses in Serum.
Abstract: Deep sequence-coupled biopanning (DSCB) is a powerful tool that couples affinity selection of a bacteriophage MS2 virus-like particle peptide display platform with deep sequencing. While this approach has been used successfully to investigate pathogen-specific antibody responses in human sera, data analysis is time-consuming and complicated. Here, we describe a streamlined data analysis method for DSCB using MATLAB, expanding the potential for this approach to be deployed rapidly and consistently.

Rating: While this abstract discusses the potential of using bacteriophage MS2 virus-like particle peptide in a certain research method, it does not directly address the research goal of modifying the MS2 phage lysis protein so it does not need to bind DNAJ. It also does not specifically mention utilizing MS2 phage in phage therapy against multidrug-resistant E. coli. Therefore, its relevance is fairly low. Rating: 2/10.

Title: Viral inactivation using microwave-enhanced membrane filtration.
Abstract: Pathogenic viruses (e.g., Enteroviruses, Noroviruses, Rotaviruses, and Adenovirus) present in wastewater, even at low concentrations, can cause serious waterborne diseases. Improving water treatment to enhance viral removal is of paramount significance, especially given the COVID-19 pandemic. This study incorporated microwave-enabled catalysis into membrane filtration and evaluated viral removal using a model bacteriophage (MS2) as a surrogate. Microwave irradiation effectively penetrated the PTFE membrane module and enabled surface oxidation reactions on the membrane-coated catalysts (i.e., BiFeO<sub>3</sub>), which thus elicited strong germicidal effects via local heating and radical formation as reported previously. A log removal of 2.6 was achieved for MS2 within a contact time as low as 20Â s using 125-W microwave irradiation with the initial MS2 concentration of 10<sup>5</sup> PFUâˆ™mL<sup>-1</sup>. By contrast, almost no inactivation could be achieved without microwave irradiation. COMSOL simulation indicates that the catalyst surface could be heated up to 305Â <sup>o</sup>C with 125-W microwave irradiation for 20Â s and also analyzed microwave penetration into catalyst or water film layers. This research provides new insights to the antiviral mechanisms of this microwave-enabled catalytic membrane filtration.

Rating: While this abstract does mention the MS2 bacteriophage, it's not specifically about modifying the lysis protein or its relationship with DNAJ. It mainly focuses on methods of enhancing viral removal in water treatment through microwave-enabled catalysis. Therefore, its relevance to MS2 usage in phage therapy against multidrug resistant E.coli is limited.

Title: Efficient deactivation of aerosolized pathogens using a dielectric barrier discharge based cold-plasma detergent in environment device for good indoor air quality.
Abstract: Air pollution is one of the top 5 risks causing chronic diseases according to WHO and airborne transmitted pathogens infection is a huge challenge in the current era. Long living pathogens and small size aerosols are not effectively dealt with by the available indoor air purifiers. In this work, a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) based portable cold-plasma detergent in environment device is reported and its disinfection efficiency has been analyzed in the indoor environment of sizes up to 3â€‰Ã—â€‰2.4â€‰Ã—â€‰2.4Â m<sup>3</sup>. The deactivation efficiency of total microbial countsÂ (TMCs) and total fungal countsÂ (TFCs) is found to be more than 99% in 90Â min of continuous operation of the device at the optimized parameters. The complete inactivation of MS2 phage and Escherichia coli bacteria with more than 5 log reduction (99.999%) has also been achieved in 30Â min and 90Â min of operation of the device in an enclosed environment. The device is able to produce negative ions predominantly dominated by natural plasma detergent along with positive ions in the environment similar to mother nature. The device comprises a coaxial DBD geometry plasma source with a specially designed wire mesh electrode of mild steel with a thickness of 1Â mm. The need for feed gas, pellets and/or differential pressure has been eliminated from the DBD discharge source for efficient air purification. The existence of negative ions for more than 25Â s on average is the key advantage, which can also deactivate long living pathogens and small size aerosols.

Rating: While this abstract is interesting and it discusses the MS2 phage and E. coli bacteria, its focus is on deactivation of pathogens through a physical method (dielectric barrier discharge), rather than the biochemical modification of the MS2 phage lysis protein or its use in phage therapy. Therefore, it is not particularly relevant to the goal of modifying the MS2 phage for use in phage therapy.

Title: The presence of RNA cargo is suspected to modify the surface hydrophobicity of the MS2 phage.
Abstract: The surface hydrophobicity of native or engineered non-enveloped viruses and virus-like particles (VLPs) is a key parameter regulating their fate in living and artificial aqueous systems. Its modulation is mainly depending on the structure and environment of particles. Nevertheless, unexplained variations have been reported between structurally similar viruses and with pH. This indicates that some modulating factors of their hydrophobicity remain to be identified. Herein we investigate the potential involvement of RNA cargo in the MS2 phage used as non-enveloped RNA virus model, by examining the SDS-induced electrophoretic mobility shift (SEMS) determined for native MS2 virions and corresponding RNA-free VLPs at various pH. Interestingly, the SEMS of VLPs was larger and more variable from pH 5 to 9 compared to native virions. These observations are discussed in term of RNA-dependent changes in surface hydrophobicity, suggesting that RNA cargo may be a major modulator/regulator of this viral parameter.

Rating: While this abstract provides valuable insight into the surface hydrophobicity of the MS2 phage and the role of RNA cargo in modulating it, it doesn't discuss the modification of the MS2 phage lysis protein and its ability to bind DNAJ. As such, it doesn't directly contribute to the specific goal of using the MS2 phage in phage therapy on multidrug resistant e. coli. However, understanding the characteristics of the MS2 phage, such as surface hydrophobicity, could indirectly assist in optimized use in phage therapy. Rating: 3/10.

Title: Mutation rate, selection, andÂ epistasis inferred from RNA virus haplotypes via neural posterior estimation.
Abstract: RNA viruses are particularly notorious for their high levels of genetic diversity, which is generated through the forces of mutation and natural selection. However, disentangling these two forces is a considerable challenge, and this may lead to widely divergent estimates of viral mutation rates, as well as difficulties in inferring the fitness effects of mutations. Here, we develop, test, and apply an approach aimed at inferring the mutation rate and key parameters that govern natural selection, from haplotype sequences covering full-length genomes of an evolving virus population. Our approach employs <i>neural posterior estimation</i>, a computational technique that applies simulation-based inference with neural networks to jointly infer multiple model parameters. We first tested our approach on synthetic data simulated using different mutation rates and selection parameters while accounting for sequencing errors. Reassuringly, the inferred parameter estimates were accurate and unbiased. We then applied our approach to haplotype sequencing data from a serial passaging experiment with the MS2 bacteriophage, a virus that parasites <i>Escherichia coli</i>. We estimated that the mutation rate of this phage is around 0.2 mutations per genome per replication cycle (95% highest density interval: 0.051-0.56). We validated this finding with two different approaches based on single-locus models that gave similar estimates but with much broader posterior distributions. Furthermore, we found evidence for reciprocal sign epistasis between four strongly beneficial mutations that all reside in an RNA stem loop that controls the expression of the viral lysis protein, responsible for lysing host cells and viral egress. We surmise that there is a fine balance between over- and underexpression of lysis that leads to this pattern of epistasis. To recap, we have developed an approach for joint inference of the mutation rate and selection parameters from full haplotype data with sequencing errors and used it to reveal features governing MS2 evolution.

Rating: This abstract is moderately relevant to the research goal of modifying the MS2 phage lysis protein for phage therapy on multi-drug resistant E.Coli. The abstract discusses the genetic diversity of RNA viruses, mutation rates, natural selection, and specifically investigates the MS2 bacteriophage. It gives valuable information about the MS2 phage's mutation rate and the role of its lysis protein. However, it does not detail about the gene responsibility for MS2's dependency on DNAJ for lysis or approaches to modify the lysis protein. Therefore, this research could potentially be a starting point in understanding the genetic manipulation of the MS2 phage but does not directly address the research objective. Rating: 5/10.

Title: Viral Disinfection of Porous Fomites Utilizing a Bacteriophage Model and Chlorine Dioxide Gas.
Abstract: The pursuit of disinfecting porous materials or fomites to inactivate viral agents has special challenges. To address these challenges, a highly portable chlorine dioxide (ClO<sub>2</sub>) gas generation system was used to ascertain the ability of a gaseous preparation to inactivate a viral agent, the MS2 bacteriophage, when associated with potentially porous fomites of cloth, paper towel, and wood. The MS2 bacteriophage is increasingly used as a model to identify means of inactivating infectious viral agents of significance to humans. Studies showed that MS2 bacteriophage can be applied to and subsequently recovered from potential porous fomites such as cloth, paper towel, and wood. Paired with viral plaque assays, this provided a means for assessing the ability of gaseous ClO<sub>2</sub> to inactivate bacteriophage associated with the porous materials. Notable results include 100% inactivation of 6 log bacteriophage after overnight exposure to 20 parts per million(ppm) ClO<sub>2</sub>. Reducing exposure time to 90 minutes and gas ppm to lower concentrations proved to remain effective in bacteriophage elimination in association with porous materials. Stepwise reduction in gas concentration from 76 ppm to 5 ppm consistently resulted in greater than 99.99% to 100% reduction of recoverable bacteriophage. This model suggests the potential of ClO<sub>2</sub> gas deployment systems for use in the inactivation of viral agents associated with porous potential fomites. The ClO<sub>2</sub> gas could prove especially helpful in disinfecting enclosed areas containing viral contaminated surfaces, rather than manually spraying and wiping them.

Rating: This abstract is tangentially related to the goal of using the MS2 phage in phage therapy on multidrug resistant e.coli. The research primarily discusses the use of ClO2 gas to inactivate bacteriophages, including the MS2, on porous materials rather than modifications on the MS2 bacteriophage itself. Furthermore, the study does not specifically relate to the interaction of the MS2 phage with the DNAJ protein or the modification thereof. Given this, it indirectly contributes to understanding MS2 phage's general behavior and susceptibility, but it's not directly relevant to the specified goal. Consequently, I would rate this a 3/10.

Title: Disinfection of Phi6, MS2, and Escherichia coli by Natural Sunlight on Healthcare Critical Surfaces.
Abstract: Ultraviolet (UV) radiation systems, commonly used to disinfect surfaces, drinking water, and air, stem from historical practice to use sunlight to disinfect household items after contagious illness. Currently, it is still recommended in viral outbreak contexts such as COVID-19, Ebola, and Marburg to expose soft surfaces to sunlight after washing with detergent or disinfecting with chlorine. However, sunlight that reaches the Earth's surface is in the UVA/UVB wavelengths, whereas UV disinfection systems typically rely on biocidal UVC. Our goal was to fill the evidence gap on the efficacy of sunlight disinfection on surface materials common in low-resource healthcare settings by seeding four surfaces (stainless steel, nitrile, tarp, cloth) with three microorganisms (viral surrogate bacteriophages Phi6 and MS2 and Escherichia coli bacteria), with and without soil load, and exposing to three sunlight conditions (full sun, partial sun, cloudy). We conducted 144 tests in triplicate and found: solar radiation averaged 737 W/m2 (SD = 333), 519 W/m2 (SD = 65), and 149 W/m2 (SD = 24) for full sun, partial sun, and cloudy conditions; significantly more surfaces averaged â‰¥Â 4 log10 reduction value (LRV) for Phi6 than MS2 and E. coli (P < 0.001) after full sun exposure, and no samples achieved â‰¥Â 4 LRV for partial sun or cloudy conditions. On the basis of our results, we recommend no change to current protocols of disinfecting materials first with a 0.5% chlorine solution then moving to sunlight to dry. Additional field-based research is recommended to understand sunlight disinfection efficacy against pathogenic organisms on healthcare relevant surfaces during actual outbreak contexts.

Rating: While the abstract mentions the MS2 phage and Escherichia coli bacteria, it doesn't directly relate to the modification of the MS2 phage lysis protein or its interaction with DNAJ. Furthermore, the focus is primarily on UV disinfection methods rather than phage therapy for multi-drug resistant E. Coli. Even though the MS2 phage might play a role in such therapies, this data doesn't aid in the specific objective of modifying the lysis protein. Therefore, the relevancy to the research task is very minimal.

Title: In-situ fabrication of titanium suboxide-laser induced graphene composites: Removal of organic pollutants and MS2 Bacteriophage.
Abstract: Titanium suboxides (TSO) are identified as a series of compounds showing excellent electro- and photo-chemical properties. TSO composites with carbon-based materials such as graphene have further improved water splitting and pollutant removal performance. However, their expensive and multi-step synthesis limits their wide-scale use. Furthermore, recently discovered laser-induced graphene (LIG) is a single-step and low-cost fabrication of graphene-based composites. Moreover, LIG's highly electrically conductive surface aids in tremendous environmental applications, including bacterial inactivation, anti-biofouling, and pollutant sensing. Here, we demonstrate the single-step in-situ fabrication of TSO-LIG composite by directly scribing the TiO<sub>2</sub> mixed poly(ether) sulfone sheets using a CO<sub>2</sub> infrared laser. In contrast, earlier composites were derived from either commercial-grade TSO or synthesized TSO with graphene in multi step processes. The characteristic Ti<sup>3+</sup> peaks in XPS confirmed the conversion of TiO<sub>2</sub> into its sub-stoichiometric form, enhancing the electro-catalytical properties of the LIG-TiO<sub>x</sub> composite surface. Electrochemical characterization, including impedance spectroscopy, validated the surface's enhanced electrochemical activity and electrode stability. Furthermore, the LIG-TiO<sub>x</sub> composite surfaces were tested for anti-biofouling action and electrochemical application as electrodes and filters. The composite electrodes exhibit enhanced degradation performance for removing emerging pollutant antibiotics ciprofloxacin and methylene blue due to the in-situ hydroxyl radical generation. Additionally, the LIG-TiO<sub>x</sub> conductive filters showed the complete 6-log killing of mixed bacterial culture and MS2 phage virus in flow-through filtration mode at 2.5Â V, which is âˆ¼2.5-log more killing compared to non-composited LIG filers at 500 Lm<sup>-2</sup>h<sup>-1</sup>. Nevertheless, these cost-effective LIG-TiO<sub>x</sub> composites have excellent electrical properties and can be effectively utilized for energy and environmental applications.

Rating: While the abstract discusses killing of MS2 phage virus, it does not provide any information on modifying the MS2 phage lysis protein or its interaction with DNAJ. The study focuses on the fabrication and application of a Titanium suboxide and laser-induced graphene composite, not on phage therapy or antibiotic resistance. Therefore, it is not relevant to the specified research goal. Rating: 1/10.

Title: Effects of surface hydrophobicity on the removal of F-specific RNA phages from reclaimed water by coagulation and ceramic membrane microfiltration.
Abstract: Microfiltration (MF) has been widely adopted as an advanced treatment process to reduce suspended solids and turbidity in treated wastewater effluents designated for potable reuse. Although microfilter pores are much larger than viruses, the addition of a coagulant upstream of a microfilter system can achieve stable virus removal. Ceramic membranes have a narrow pore size distribution to achieve the high removal of contaminants. This study aims to evaluate virus log reduction using bench-scale coagulation and ceramic membrane MF. To investigate the effects of differences in net surface hydrophobicity, 18 sewage-derived F-specific RNA phages (FRNAPHs) were used for batch hydrophobicity and coagulation-MF tests. The capability of bench-scale coagulation and ceramic membrane MF under continuous automated long-term operation was tested to remove the lab reference strain MS2 and three selected FRNAPH isolates which varied by surface property. Median virus log reduction values (LRVs) exceeding 6.2 were obtained for all three isolates and MS2. Although coagulation and hydrophobicity were positively correlated, the virus isolate demonstrating the lowest level of hydrophobicity and coagulation (genogroup I) still exhibited a high LRV. Thus, coagulation and ceramic membrane MF systems may serve as viable options for virus removal during water reclamation and advanced treatment.

Rating: While this abstract provides interesting information on the use of microfiltration for virus removal, including the MS2 phage, in water treatment processes, it does not provide any direct information or research on how to modify the MS2 phage lysis protein so it doesn't need to bind DNAJ. Therefore, it's not directly related to the goal of using MS2 phage in phage therapy on multidrug resistant E. coli.

Title: Automated design of protein-binding riboswitches for sensing human biomarkers in a cell-free expression system.
Abstract: Cell-free genetically encoded biosensors have been developed to detect small molecules and nucleic acids, but they have yet to be reliably engineered to detect proteins. Here we develop an automated platform to convert protein-binding RNA aptamers into riboswitch sensors that operate within low-cost cell-free assays. We demonstrate the platform by engineering 35 protein-sensing riboswitches for human monomeric C-reactive protein, human interleukin-32Î³, and phage MS2 coat protein. The riboswitch sensors regulate output expression levels by up to 16-fold with input protein concentrations within the human serum range. We identify two distinct mechanisms governing riboswitch-mediated regulation of translation rates and leverage computational analysis to refine the protein-binding aptamer regions, improving design accuracy. Overall, we expand the cell-free sensor toolbox and demonstrate how computational design is used to develop protein-sensing riboswitches with future applications as low-cost medical diagnostics.

Rating: While this abstract involves the phage MS2 coat protein, it primarily focuses on developing riboswitch sensors for proteins, specifically for use in low-cost medical diagnostics. The aim to modify the MS2 protein or its use in phage therapy on multidrug-resistant E. coli is not directly covered. Therefore, its relevance to the given context is minimal. Rating: 3/10.

Title: Enveloped and non-enveloped virus survival on microfiber towels.
Abstract: Handwashing is an important intervention which can reduce indirect disease transmission, however soap and water for handwashing purposes is not available in some low-resource regions. When handwashing with soap and water is not possible, individuals may use alternatives such as the Supertowel (a microfiber towel with an antimicrobial coating). Testing of viral inactivation as a result of antimicrobial treatment on the Supertowel, however, has been limited. The goal of this study is to provide information about the performance of the Supertowel's antimicrobial treatment against viruses, which will help inform the use of the towels as handwashing alternatives.

Rating: This abstract is not relevant to the goal of using the MS2 phage in phage therapy on multidrug resistant E. coli. It discusses the antimicrobial properties of a product, the Supertowel, but does not mention anything about MS2 phage, modifying lysis proteins, or DNAJ binding.

Title: Identification and Characterization of HEPN-MNT Type II TA System from Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus Î”H.
Abstract: Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are widespread in bacteria and archaea plasmids and genomes to regulate DNA replication, gene transcription, or protein translation. Higher eukaryotic and prokaryotic nucleotide-binding (HEPN) and minimal nucleotidyltransferase (MNT) domains are prevalent in prokaryotic genomes and constitute TA pairs. However, three gene pairs (MTH304/305, 408/409, and 463/464) of Methanothermobacter thermautotropicus Î”H HEPN-MNT family have not been studied as TA systems. Among these candidates, our study characterizes the MTH463/MTH464 TA system. MTH463 expression inhibited Escherichia coli growth, whereas MTH464 did not and blocked MTH463 instead. Using site-directed MTH463 mutagenesis, we determined that amino acids R99G, H104A, and Y106A from the R[É¸X]4-6H motif are involved with MTH463 cell toxicity. Furthermore, we established that purified MTH463 could degrade MS2 phage RNA, whereas purified MTH464 neutralized MTH463 activity in vitro. Our results indicate that the endonuclease toxin MTH463 (encoding a HEPN domain) and its cognate antitoxin MTH464 (encoding the MNT domain) may act as a type II TA system in M. thermautotropicus Î”H. This study provides initial and essential information studying TA system functions, primarily archaea HEPN-MNT family.

Rating: This abstract focuses on the study of the toxin-antitoxin system, specifically in the context of MTH463/MTH464 gene pairs and their effects on Escherichia coli growth. Moreover, it provides insights into the potential use of TA systems as a method to degrade harmful phage RNA, which may be indirectly beneficial for phage therapy. However, there is no direct mention or examination of modifying the MS2 phage lysis protein. Therefore, while it can provide tangential insights for phage therapy, it may be less useful for the specific research aim of negating DNAJ binding. Rating 4/10.
