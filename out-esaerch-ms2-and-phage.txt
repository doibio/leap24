Kinetic studies of the interaction between MS2 phage and F pilus of Escherichia 
coli.

Date T.

The kinetics of the binding reaction of MS2 phage to free F pili, which were 
highly purified from Escherichia coli, has been studied using a membrane filter 
assay. The rate of dissociation (kd) of the MS2-phage--F-pilus complex is very 
slow and follows first-order kinetics with a half-life of 4.2 h at 30 degrees C 
in the standard buffer. The dissociation rate is rather insensitive to 
temperature, but becomes more rapid at high ionic strength or at basic pH. In a 
0.25 M ionic strength buffer, the half-life of the complex is about 1.0 min. The 
rate of association is very fast and follows second-order kinetics with the rate 
constant for association (ka) being 8 x 10(7) M-1 s-1 at 30 degrees C in the 
standard buffer. The rate of association is almost insensitive to ionic strength 
but slightly sensitive to pH or temperature. Monovalent cations can also promote 
the binding reaction as well as divalent cations but the complex formed with 
monovalent cation is unstable. A study of the kinetics of dissociation suggests 
that there are two types of interaction between MS2 phage and F pilus; one is a 
strong interaction formed with divalent cations and the other is a weak one 
formed with monovalent cations. The physical nature of the bonds involved in the 
former and the latter seems to be mainly electrostatic and non-electrostatic 
respectively. The mechanism of the binding reaction is discussed.

[Effect of synthetic polynucleotides and RNA on poly(C)-dependent poly(G) 
polymerase activity of Q beta replicase].

[Article in Russian]

Berzin VM, Gren EJ.

The effect of synthetic polynucleotides and phage RNA on poly(C)-dependent 
synthesis of poly (G) by Qbeta replicase is studied. It is shown that single 
stranded poly(U) and poly (dT) are strong inhibitors whereas structured 
polynucleotides poly(A), MS2 RNA as well as double stranded complexes 
poly(A)-poly(U) and poly(A)-poly(dT) do not affect the synthesis of poly(G). It 
is suggested that contact region of template with enzyme has single stranded 
unhelical structure and affinity of polynucleotides to Qbeta replicase is 
determined by degree of their secondary structure.

Antiviral effect on MS-2 coliphage obtained with a synthetic antigen.

Langbeheim H, Arnon R, Sela M.

The coat protein of bacteriophage MS-2 was cleaved with cyanogen bromide to 
yield three fragments, possessing the sequence 1-88 (P1), 89-108 (P2), and 
109-129 (P3), respectively. The mixture of peptides P2 and P3, which could not 
be separated, was found capable of inhibiting the neutralization of the phage by 
antiserum to the whole MS-2. The peptides corresponding to P2 and P3 were 
therefore synthesized. The synthetic P3 had no capacity to interfere with 
neutralization of MS-2, not did its macromolecular conjugate with multichain 
poly(DL-alanine) elicit neutralizing antibodies. On the other hand, the 
synthetic P2 was very efficient in inhibiting the inactivation of the phage by 
the antiserum against phage. Furthermore, a synthetic antigen prepared by 
attachment of P2 to multichain poly(alanine) incuded antiserum in rabbits that 
was capable of neutralizing MS-2 activity almost as efficiently as the antiserum 
prepared against the intact coat protein. This inactivation is specific, because 
it can, in turn, be totally inhibited by P2 peptide.

Reverse transcription of phage RNA and its fragment directed by synthetic 
heteropolymeric primers.

Frolova LY, Metelyev VG, Ratmanova KI, Smirnov VD, Shabarova ZA, Prokofyev MA, 
Berzin VM, Jansone IV, Gren EJ, Kisselev LL.

DNA synthesis catalysed by RNA-directed DNA-polymerase (reverse transcriptase) 
was found to proceed on the RNA template of an MS2 phage in the presence of 
heteropolymeric synthetic octa- and nonadeoxyribonucleotide primers 
complementary to the intercistronic region (coat protein binding site) and the 
region of the coat protein cistron, respectively. The product of synthesis 
consists of discrete DNA fractions of different length, including transcripts 
longer than 1,000 nucleotides. The coat protein inhibits DNA synthesis if it is 
initiated at its binding site, but has no effect on DNA synthesis initiated at 
the coat protein cistron. It has been suggested that, in this system, the 
initiation of DNA synthesis by synthetic primers is topographically specific. 
The MS2 coat protein binding site (an RNA fragment of 59 nucleotides) serves as 
a template for polydeoxyribonucleotide synthesis in the presence of 
octanucleotide primer and reverse transcriptase. The product of synthesis is 
homogenous and its length corresponds to the length of the template. The 
effective and complete copying of the fragment having a distinct secondary 
structure proves that the secondary structure does not interfere, in principle, 
with RNA being a template in the system of reverse transcription.

Adjuvant effect of a peptidoglycan attached covalently to a synthetic antigen 
provoking anti-phage antibodies.

Langbeheim H, Arnon R, Sela M.

The synthetic antigen denoted P2-A--L, comprising the fragment P2 of the coat 
protein of MS-2 coliphage attached to multichain poly-DL-alanine, served for the 
immunization of guinea-pigs. Immunization was carried out either in phosphate 
buffered saline (PBS) or in Freund's incomplete adjuvant (FIA) in the presence 
or absence of a small molecular weight peptidoglycan prepared from Bacillus 
megaterium, which was checked for its adjuvant effect. The various antisera were 
assessed by their capacity to neutralize MS-2 bacteriophage viability. When 
injected in PBS or FIA, P2-A--L did not elicit any measurable anti-phage 
activity. Addition of the peptidoglycan by simple mixing did not bring about a 
significant increase in antibody production. However, when the peptidoglycan was 
chemically linked to the P2-A--L conjugate, it had a marked adjuvant effect when 
the material was administered in FIA, almost identical to the extent of the 
effect of Freund's complete adjuvant.

Translation of MS2 RNA in vitro in the absence of initiation factor IF-3.

Zipori P, Bosch L, van Duin J.

An Escherichia coli cell-free translational system, deprived of initiation 
factor IF-3, has been used to study the role of the factor in protein synthesis. 
In this system, 30-S ribosomal subunits are preincubated together with MS2 phage 
RNA in a small volume in the presence of 10 mM Mg(Ac)2; the missing components 
required for protein synthesis are then added and assembly of elongating 
ribosomes is allowed to occur. This stepwise assembly process permits formation 
of functional complexes which can carry out protein synthesis in the complete 
absence of IF-3. The translational products, obtained in the absence of IF-3, 
have been analysed and shown to be similar to those synthesized in the presence 
of the factor. The main product observed is the phage coat protein.

[Regulatory region of the MS2 phage RNA replicase cistron. Accesibility of MS2 
RNA specific fragment to T1 RNAse digestion and chemical modification with 
kethoxal].

[Article in Russian]

Berzin' VM, Iansone IV, Gribanov VA, Tsimanis AIu, Gren EIa.

Partial digestion with T1 RNAase and chemical modification with kethoxal were 
used to study stability of two hairpin in the proposed secondary structure of 
the functionally active MS2 RNA fragment MS2 R(--53 leads to 6), containing the 
regulatory region of the phage replicase cistron. Analysis of the products 
obtained after the above treatments showed that T1 RNAase and kethoxal attacked 
predominantly the guanosine residues in the hairpin b of the MS2 R(--53 leads to 
6). This implies that in contrast to the structurally stable hairpin a of the 
polynucleotide, hairpin b appears to be more labile and may exist under the 
present experimental conditions in equilibrium with its open form. The data of 
the competition experiments demonstrated that the kethoxal modified MS2 R(-53 
leads to 6) and shorter polynucleotide MS2 R(-53 leads to-11) obtained from MS2 
R(-53 leads to 6) after T1 RNAase digestion failed to bind with MS2 coat 
protein. The relatively unstable hairpin b region in the polynucleotide MS2 
R(-53 leads to 6) is suggested to play essential role in the complex formation.

The primary structure of the coat protein of the broad-host-range RNA 
bacteriophage PRR1.

Dhaese P, Vandekerckhove JS, van Montagu MC.

The complete amino acid sequence of the coat protein of RNA bacteriophage PRR1 
is presented. After thermolysin digestion, 26 peptides were isolated, covering 
the complete coat protein chain. Their alignment was established in part using 
automated Edman degradation on the intact protein, in part with overlapping 
peptides obtained by enzymic hydrolysis with trypsin, pepsin, subtilisin and 
Staphylococcus aureus protease, and by chemical cleavage with cyanogen bromide 
and N-bromosuccinimide. To obtain the final overlaps, a highly hydrophobic, 
insoluble tryptic peptide was sequenced for seven steps by the currently used 
manual dansyl-Edman degradation procedure, which was slightly modified for 
application on insoluble peptides. PRR1 coat protein contains 131 amino acids, 
corresponding to a molecular weight of 14534. It is highly hydrophobic, and the 
residues with ionizable side chains are distributed unevenly: acidic residues 
are absent in the middle third of the sequence, whereas a clustering of basic 
residues occurs between positions 44 and 62. PRR1 coat protein was compared with 
the coat proteins of RNA coliphages MS2 and Q beta, and the minimum mutation 
distance was calculated for both comparisons. It is highly probable that PRR1. Q 
beta and MS2 share a common ancestor. The basic region present in the three coat 
proteins is recognized as an essential structural feature of RNA phage coat 
proteins.

The regulatory region of MS2 phage RNA replicase cistron. III. Characterization 
of fragments resulting from S1 nuclease digestion.

Jansone I, Berzin V, Gribanov V, Gren EJ.

The functionally active fragments MS2 R(-53 leads to 6) and MS2 R(-53 leads to 
3) comprising the regulatory region for the replicase cistron have been isolated 
from MS2 RNA-coat protein complex following T1 RNase digestion. In order to 
obtain shorter fragments, active in coat protein binding and initiation of 
translation, MS2 R(-53 leads to 6) was cleaved with S1 nuclease. The results 
indicate that S1 nuclease attacks the most susceptible loop regions of the two 
hairpin helices of MSZ R(-53) leads to 6). Among the three fragments which have 
been isolated, only MS2 R(-35/33 leads to 6) containing the intact hairpin (b) 
region with initiation codon AUG is active in the coat protein binding. 
Functional activity exerted by another polynucleotide MS R(-17 leads to 6) 
supports the assumption that specific binding with the coat protein is 
determined by the hairpin (b) region prior to the replicase cistron.

Secondary structure of the 5' end of bacteriophage MS2 RNA Methoxyamine and 
kethoxal modification.

Iserentant D, Fiers W.

To refine the secondary structure model of the 5' end of the bacteriophage MS2 
genome, 32P-labeled MS2 RNA was partially digested with T1 RNase or with 
Cm-RNase and the 5'-end fragment was isolated, renatured and submitted to 
treatment with methoxyamine or kethoxal. The resulting modified RNA was digested 
with T1 RNase and the products were separated by minifingerprinting. 
Methoxyamine-induced modification of exposed cytidines was detected by 
differential mobility of modified oligonucleotides, while kethoxal-induced 
alteration of exposed guanosines was monitored by resistance to T1 ribonuclease 
digestion. The positions of the modified residues are discussed in terms of an 
improved secondary structure model proposed for the 5' end of the viral RNA. The 
structure itself is discussed in relation to sequence conservation and 
biological function.

Enhanced differential synthesis of proteins in a mammalian cell-free system by 
addition of polyamines.

Atkins JF, Lewis JB, Anderson CW, Gesteland RF.

Addition of the polyamines spermidine, spermine, or putrescine to a fractionated 
mammalian cell-free protein-synthesis system programmed by a variety of mRNAs 
results in a 3- to 5-fold stimulation of amino acid incorporation over that 
found in the absence of added polyamine. The mRNAs used as template were 
adenovirus mRNA, globin 9s mRNA, and RNA from the bacteriophages R17, Qbeta, and 
MS2. The relative amounts of 10 adenovirus polypeptides synthesized in vitro are 
altered by the addition of polyamines to the translation system to reflect more 
closely the relative amounts of these polypeptides synthesized in vivo. This 
qualititive improvement in translation products on addition of polyamines allow 
the analysis of a number of products which are at best only marginally 
synthesized in the absence of added polyamines. The low level of synthesis due 
to endogenous mRNA is stimulated by spermidine and spermine but a lesser extent 
by putrescine.

tRNA nucleotidyltransferase-catalyzed incorporation of CMP and AMP into 
RNA-bacteriophage genome fragments.

Prochiantz A, Bénicourt C, Carré D, Haenni AL.

Fragments of bacteriophage RNAs R17, MS2 and Qbeta obtained by incubation with 
commercial snake venom phosphodiesterase become substrates of the Escherichia 
coli tRNA nucleotidyltransferase. The transferase adds back CMP and AMP in 
conditions in which it remains highly specific of CCA-deprived tRNAs. The 
results suggest that the fragment from the 3' end of the viral genome and/or 
possibly one or more internal fragment(s) are recognized by the transferase. 
These observations might indicate that bacteriophage RNAs contain certain 
features probably present in all tRNAs and which are recognized by the 
transferase.

Deviations from compositional randomness in eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins: 
the hypothesis of selective-stochastic stability and a principle of charge 
conservation.

Holmquist R.

Eight proteins of diverse lengths, functions, and origin, are examined for 
compositional non-randomness amino acid by amino acid. The proteins investigated 
are human fibrinopeptide A, guinea pig Insulin, rattlesnake cytochrome c, MS2 
phage coat protein, rabbit triosephosphate isomerase, bovine pancreatic 
deoxyribonuclease A, bovine glutamate dehydrogenase, and Bacillus 
thermoproteolyticus thermolysin. As a result of this study the experimentally 
testable hypothesis is put forth that for a large class of proteins the ratio of 
that fraction of the molecule which exhibits compositional non-randomness to 
that fraction which does not is on the average, stable about a mean value 
(estimated as 0.32 plus or minus 0.17) and (nearly) independent of protein 
length. Stochastic and selective evolutionary forces are viewed as interacting 
rather than independent phenomena. With respect to amino acid composition, this 
coupling ameliorates the current controversy over Darwinian vs. non-Darwinian 
evolution, selectionist vs. neutralist, in favor of neither: Within the context 
of the quantitative data, the evolution of real proteins is seen as a compromise 
between the two viewpoints, both important. The compositional fluctuations of 
the electrically charged amino acids glutamic and aspartic acid, lysine and 
arginine, are examined in depth for over eighty protein families, both 
prokaryotic and eukaryotic. For both taxa, each of the acidic amino acids is 
present in amounts roughly twice that predicted from the genetic code. The 
presence of an excess of glutamic acid is independent of the presence of an 
excess of aspartic acid and vice versa.

[MS2 RNA hydrolysis by snake venom phosphodiesterase and template properties of 
RNA produced by limited exonucleolytic action].

[Article in Russian]

Iansone IV, Rozental' GF, Renkhov RF, Gren EIa.

The action of snake venom phosphodiesterase on bacteriophage MS2 RNA under 
conditions of limited hydrolysis has been studied. The content of 
5'-mononucleotides released during hydrolysis does not correspond to the 
calculated one based on the 3'-terminal nucleotide sequence of MS2 RNA. This 
finding suggests the occurrence of endonucleolytic splits in MS2 RNA with 
concomitant exonucleolytic digestion of some newly formed fragments. A high 
molecular weight RNA fraction, comprising unfragmented MS2 RNA with about 
5-63'-terminal nucleotides removed is separated by sucrose gradient 
centrifugation and shown not to differ from the native MS2 RNA in its template 
function in a cell-free protein synthesizing system. It is demonstrated that 
template activity, polarity of translation, and nascent peptide chain 
termination on the MS2 replicase cistron are not affected by the removal of 
3'terminal nucleotides of MS2 RNA. Consequently, these nucleotides are 
unessential in translation of native MS2 RNA.

Inactivation of clay-associated bacteriophage MS-2 by chlorine.

Stagg CH, Wallis C, Ward CH.

The model system consisted of bacteriophage MS-2, bentonite clay, and 
hypochlorous acid (HOC1). Factors that influenced association of the bacterial 
virus with bentonite were the titer of unadsorbed viruses, clay concentration, 
cation concentration, temperature, stirring rate, and the presence of soluble 
organics. Variation of the kinetic adsorption rate constant with stirring speed 
indicates that phage attachment is a diffusion-limited process; the attachment 
reaction has an apparent activation energy of 1 kcal/mol. About 18% of 
clay-associated bacteriophages was recovered by mixing the suspension with an 
organic eluent. Inactivation data were obtained from batch reactors operated 
under those conditions in which loss of HOC1 was minimal during the reaction. 
Bacteriophages attached to clay were more resistant to HOC1 than were freely 
suspended phages; for equivalent HOC1 concentrations, clay-associated phages 
required about twice the time that freely suspended phages required for loss of 
99% of the initial virus titer.

Inhibitory effect of methylated derivatives of guanylic acid for protein 
synthesis with reference to the functional structure of the 5'-'cap' in viral 
messenger RNA.

Miura KI, Kodama Y, Shimotohna K, Fukui T, Ikehara M, Nakagawa I, Hata T.

Guanylic acid modified variously with methyl groups on base or sugar moieties 
were synthesized chemically and their inhibitory effects on protein synthesis 
were tesetd in a wheat germ cell-free system using mRNAs from cytoplasmic 
polyhedrosis virus and tobacco mosaic virus. The confronting dinucleotide m7G5' 
pppA that corresponds to the most simple 'cap' structure of an eukaryotic mRNA 
is a strong inhibitor of protein synthesis, but non-methylated G5' pppA or G5' 
ppA is not inhibitory. The strong inhibitory effect is observed only by 
7-methylguanylic acid (pm7G). Among 11 derivatives of pG, the most effective 
inhibitors are methylated at the 7-position. Further methylation at the other 
position sometimes cancels the inhibitory effect. Although pm7G carries a 
positively charged base, other nucleotides which carry a plus charged base 
(1-methyladenylic acid and 2-methylthio-7-methylinosinic acid) were not 
inhibitory. Thus, methylation at the 7-position on guanylic acid is specifically 
required for the inhibitory effect. Addition of pm7G was inhibitory for the 
formation of the initiation complex for eukaryotic protein synthesis. These 
results suggest that the 'cap' component containing 7-methylguanylic acid in 
viral mRNA participates during protein synthesis, especially in its initial 
steps. Protein synthesis in a bacterial cell-free system was not inhibited by 
addition of m7GpppA or pm7G when either TMV RNA or phage MS2 RNA was used as an 
mRNA.

Nucleic acid binding and unfolding properties of ribosomal protein S1 and the 
derivatives S1-F1 and m1-S1.

Thomas JO, Boublik M, Szer W, Subramanian AR.

The nucleic acid binding and unwinding properties of wild-type Escherichia coli 
ribosomal protein S1 have been compared to those of a mutant form and a large 
trypsin-resistant fragment, both reported recently [J. Mol. Biol. 127, 41-45 
(1979) and J. Biol. Chem. 254, 4309-4312 (1979). The mutant (m1-S1) contains 77% 
and the fragment (S1-F1) 66% of the polypeptide chain length (approximately 600 
amino acid residues) of protein S1. The mutant is active in protein synthesis in 
vitro; the fragment, although retaining one or more of the functional domains of 
S1, is inactive in protein synthesis. We find that m1-S1 is is almost as 
effective as S1 in binding to poly(rU), phage MS2 RNA and simian virus 40 (SV40) 
DNA, and in unfolding poly(rU) and the helical structures present in MS2 RNA and 
phi X174 viral DNA. S1-F1, however, binds to poly(rU) and denatured SV40 DNA, 
but not to MS2 RNA. It unfolds neither poly(rU), nor the residual secondary 
structure of MS2 RNA or phi X174 viral DNA. Thus, there appears to be a 
correlation between the loss in ability of S1 to unwind RNA and the loss in its 
ability to function in protein synthesis.

Effect of benzo[a]pyrene-diolepoxide on infectivity and in vitro translation of 
phage MS2 RNA.

Sagher D, Harvey RG, Hsu WT, Weiss SB.

Previous studies have shown that alkylation of MS2 RNA by certain derivatives of 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons renders it noninfectious. Since phage RNA 
serves as a template for translation and transcription, either of these 
RNA-directed processes, or both, could be responsible in vivo for the inhibition 
of phage replication by metabolically activated hydrocarbons. The present study 
correlates the degree of inhibition of MS2 RNA infectivity, at various levels of 
alkylation by (+/-)-trans, 
7,8-dihydroxy-anti-9,10-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzol[a]pyrene, with the 
translation efficiency in vitro of the same alkylated RNA for the synthesis of 
viral synthetase and of maturation and coat proteins. The results indicate that 
dihydroxyepoxy-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene modification of MS2 RNA impairs its 
template capacity for the synthesis of phage-specific proteins; this inhibition 
is insufficient, however, to account for the loss of RNA infectivity at lower 
molar ratios of alkylation. For the three viral proteins synthesized in vitro, 
the translation of RNA synthetase is much more sensitive to MS2 RNA modification 
than either coat or maturation protein synthesis. Our results also indicate that 
the loss of viral RNA infectivity follows a single-hit inactivation mechanism, 
whereas several alkylation events in the viral RNA synthetase cistron may be 
necessary to block translation of this gene product.

Effect of entry exclusion on mating aggregates and transconjugants.

Eckerson HW, Reynard AM.

Mating aggregates during conjugation directed by an F-like R factor in 
Escherichia coli were measured as the number of Lac+-Lac- sectored colonies 
present in a mating mixture. There is a high degree of correlation between the 
concentration of transconjugants produced in a mating mixture and the 
concentration of mating aggregates observed at several different concentrations 
of donor and recipient cells. The mating aggregates are sex pilus specific as 
demonstrated by the ability of donor-specific ribonucleic acid phage MS-2 to 
decrease both mating aggregates and transconjugants in a mating mixture. During 
entry exclusion by either a derepressed or a repressed F-like R factor, isogenic 
to the superinfecting R factor except for a resistance determinant, the number 
of transconjugants was markedly reduced, but the number of mating aggregates was 
not decreased. Entry exclusion by F-Gal toward the donor HfrH resembled that of 
the F-like R factor in that there was a reduction in the number of recombinants 
but no significant decrease in mating aggregates. These results suggest that 
entry exclusion inhibits conjugation at a stage after the formation of mating 
aggregates.

Codon-acticodon recognition in the valine codon family.

Mitra SK, Lustig F, Akesson B, Lagerkvist U.

An in vitro protein-synthesizing system completely dependent on added valine 
tRNA (valyl-tRNAval) and programmed with RNA from the phage MS2 has been used to 
investigate the incorporation into MS2 coat protein of valine from isoaccepting 
valyl-tRNAsval with the anticodons U AC (U represents 5-oxyacetic acid uridine 
monophosphate), GAC, and IAC in response to the four valine codons GUU, GUC, 
GUA, and GUG. By examining the incorporation of valine into NH2-terminal and 
internal positions of three tryptic peptides from the MS2 coat protein it has 
been established that these anticodons each recognize all four valine codons. We 
therefore conclude that under our conditions of in vitro protein synthesis the 
genetic code, as far as the valine codons are concerned, is operationally a two 
letter code, i.e. the third codon nucleotide has no absolute discriminating 
function.

Streptomycin-resistant Escherichia coli mutant temperature sensitive for the 
production of Qbeta-infective particles.

Engelberg-Kulka H, Dekel L, Israeli-Reches M.

A streptomycin-resistant Escherichia coli mutant has been isolated that is 
temperature sensitive for Qbeta phage, but not for the group I RNA phages f2, 
MS2, and R17. The growth of Qbeta in the mutant at the nonpermissive temperature 
(42 degrees C) results in the release of a near-normal burst of noninfectious 
particles that cosediment with Qbeta in a sucrose gradient. It is assumed that 
the mutant is defective at elevated temperatures in the suppression of nonsense 
codons, thereby producing Qbeta-like particles which are noninfectious because 
of the lack of the read-through protein A1.

Effect of spermidine on the RNA-A protein complex isolated from the RNA 
bacteriophage MS2.

Leipold B.

The polyamine spermidine has recently been reported to be a substantial 
component of the RNA phage particle. Its effect on the isolated RNA-A protein 
complex of the phage MS2 is investigated here. This complex infects intact 
Escherichia coli cells via F-pili, as does the whole phage. It is shown that the 
infectivity of the complex on intact E. coli cells was enhanced by incubation 
with spermidine. Optimal stimulation (20-fold) of the complex infectivity was 
achieved by incubation with 3 x 10(-4) M spermidine for 20 to 30 min at 37 
degrees C. This gave a more compact structure to the complex, as could be seen 
by its faster sedimentation in sucrose gradients. Although spermidine and Mg2+ 
are known to partially replace one another in several systems, no enhancement of 
the infectivity of the complex, but only its considerably faster sedimentation 
in sucrose gradients, occurred after incubation with 3 x 10(-4) M Mg2+. Only if 
the Mg2+ concentration was raised by more than one order of magnitude could 
increased infectivity of the complex be observed. At concentrations of 
spermidine and Mg2+ that maximally stimulated the infectivity of the complex on 
intact E. coli cells, no increase in infectivity of phenol-extracted RNA to E. 
coli spheroplasts was detected. From these in vitro results, the role of the 
polyamine spermidine in the RNA phage particle for the infecting, RNA-A protein 
complex molecules in phage infection is discussed.

Differential utilization of leucyl-tRNAs by Escherichia coli.

Holmes WM, Goldman E, Miner TA, Hatfield GW.

The utilization of the isoaccepting species of leucyl-tRNA in protein synthesis 
has been examined in E. coli. Two minor leucyl-tRNA species, isoacceptors 
tRNA3Leu and tRNA4Leu, are the predominant species found bound to ribosomes 
during exponential growth in minimal medium. In rich medium, an increased 
proportion of tRNA1Leu is found bound to ribosomes. One species, tRNA5Leu, is 
always absent from ribosomes. In a mutant strain in which normal tRNA3Leu and 
tRNA5Leu are reduced or absent, tRNA1Leu is a major ribosome-bound species in 
minimal medium. Protein synthesis in vitro with RNA from E. coli further 
suggests that tRNA5Leu is rarely used for total protein synthesis; however, this 
species is active with RNA from MS2 phage. We propose that tRNA1Leu can 
substitute for tRNA3Leu under rapid growth conditions, and that tRNA5Leu is used 
minimally in total protein synthesis.

On the process of cellular division in Escherichia coli: a mutant of E. coli 
lacking a murein-lipoprotein.

Hirota Y, Suzuki H, Nishimura Y, Yasuda S.

A mutant of E. coli lacking a specific outer membrane lipoprotein was found. 
Both the free and the bound form have been lost in this mutant. No material that 
cross-reacted with antiserum against lipoprotein was detected by the Ouchterlony 
test. The mutant was defective in producing mRNA active for lipoprotein 
synthesis. The mutation leading to the loss of lipoprotein synthesis, referred 
to as lpo, seems to have arisen during production of an F'. The map position of 
lpo was at 36.5 min on the E. coli K12 map, in the order man, uidA, lpo, aroD, 
pps. The lpo mutant grew and divided normally and remained susceptible to 
bacteriophages lambda, phi80, P1, P2, the T series, and f1, f2, and MS2 in its 
male derivatives. The mutant was hypersensitive to EDTA and cationic dves and 
somewhat sensitive to detergents. There was considerable leakage of periplasmic 
enzymes but passive transport of beta-galactoside was unchanged. These 
physiological characteristics of the mutant suggest that lipoprotein is involved 
in maintaining the integrity of the outer envelope structure, by bridging the 
outer membrane and murein, but not in the vital processes of growth and 
division.

Inhibition of beta-galactosidase synthesis in Escherichia coli after infection 
with different DNA and RNA phages.

Jiresová M, Janecek J.

Infection of Escherichia cooi with T1, T2r+, T3 and T4 phages leads to an 
immediate inhibition of beta-galactosidase synthesis. Similar results were 
obtained with the virulent mutant of phage lambda. The degree of inhibition of 
beta-galactosidase synthesis depends on the time delay between the addition of 
the inducer and the phage particles, and on the amount of phage DNA, which has 
penetrated into the host cell. RNA phage MS2 exhibited no inhibitory effect on 
enzyme synthesis.

The effect of the ribosomal protein S1 from Escherichia coli on the synthesis in 
vitro of bacterial-, DNA phage- and RNA phage proteins.

van Dieijen G, van Knippenberg PH, van Duin J, Koekman B, Pouwels PH.

Using an in vitro preparation for protein synthesis, we have studied the effect 
of the ribosomal protein S1 from Escherichia coli on the synthesis of the coat 
protein of the RNA-containing phages Qbeta and MS2, on that of an "early" and a 
"late" enzyme encoded by the DNA containing phage T7, and on that of 
anthranilate synthetase, an enzyme encoded by the bacterial tryptophan operon. 
Our results indicate that for the synthesis of these five proteins the presence 
of S1 is required. From these results we conclude that S1 is an essential 
protein for the translation of bacterial and bacteriophage messenger RNA.

Effects of pyrrol-carboxylic acid derivatives on the growth of coliphages.

Yamabe S, Shimizu M.

Effects of 14 pyrrol-carboxylic acid derivatives and analogues (PY-compounds) on 
the growth of coliphage MS2 using E. coli E102 (Hfr) as the host were measured 
by the agar double-layer method. Enlargements of plaque size were observed with 
7 PY-compounds but increase in plaque numbers was not induced. These 
enlargements of plaque size were specific to RNA coliphages MS2, GA and qbeta 
and not found with DNA coliphages delta AC and T4. Furthermore, the interaction 
between PY-compound PY-10 and the coliphage MS2 was dependent on the host 
bacterium (indicator strain). When E102 (Hfr) was used, the enlargement was 
marked, in the case of substrain W1895 (Hfr) it was less, while in the case of 
substrain W6 (F+) it was undetectable. The one-step growth of the phage MS2 and 
the production of intracellular phage MS2 were little affected by the 
PY-compound PY-10. However, the rate of one-step growth was increased in the 
early stage after infection. Accordingly, the enlargements of plaque size by the 
PY-compounds might be correlated with an increase in rate of release of phage 
particles.

[Resistance to phage MS2 induced in E. coli by infection with that phage].

[Article in Russian]

Pererva TP.

A sensitive cell of E. coli AB 259 Hfr 3000 infected with RNA-containing phage 
MS2 produces phages and simultaneously continues to divide showing a segregation 
of sensitive cells which maintain new cycles of the infection. Phage 
multiplication in the sensitive cell induces phage-resistant forms in the 
progeny of this cell. The described phenomenon is not caused by selection of 
pre-existing F--cells, but may result from a direct interaction of phage 
products with the episomal DNA coding proteins for F-pili. The elucidation of 
the mechanisms of this phenomenon may pave the way to studies of the DNA- and 
RNA- containing genome interaction within the cell, the mechanisms of persistent 
infection and the causes of different degrees in phage virulence.

The authors studied 130 strains of serologically typed E. coli for the capacity

increase of the donor-specific phages reaction was found in 12 cases. Some of 
the detected L-like plasmides bore determinants of colicinogenicity or drug 
resistance. Such plasmides were transmissive and capable of inhibiting donor 
properties controlled by factor F'-lac+, i.e. they served as plasmides of type 
fi+.

The reaction of SLE antibodies with native, single stranded RNA: radioassay and 
binding specificities.

Eilat D, Steinberg AD, Schechter AN.

Escherichia coli 3H-tRNA and MS2 phage 125I-RNA were prepared and used in a 
sensitive nitrocellulose filter assay. Antibodies that bound these RNA ligands 
occurred in the sera of several patients with SLE, but not in sera of patients 
with other connective tissue diseases. The antibody populations that bound 
polyribonucleotides (largely IgG) were distinct from antibody populations that 
bound polydeoxyribonucleotides. Competition experiments showed that the anti-RNA 
antibodies preferentially bound native ssRNA as compared with synthetic single 
and double stranded polyribonucleotides. There was increasing affinity with 
increasing m.w. of the ssRNA. The anti-tRNA population was of restricted 
heterogeneity (Sips index 0.83) and bound tRNA with an average association 
constant (Ko) of 9 x 10(6) l/mole at 4 degrees C. The anti-MS2 RNA population 
was much more heterogeneous (Sips index 0.67) and bound MS2 RNA with a Ko of 
about 3 x 10(9) l/mole at 4 degrees C. Whereas NZB/NZW mice spontaneously 
produce RNA reactive antibodies with conformation specificity for native tRNA, 
human SLE anti-RNA antibodies appear to have very little of this type of 
conformation specificity.

Escherichia coli mutant temperature sensitive for group I RNA bacteriophages.

Schoulaker R, Engelberg-Kulka H.

The temperature-sensitive conjugational transfer-deficient mutant Escherichia 
coli JCFL39, carrying a traD(Ts) mutation, is herein described as also being 
temperature sensitive for group I RNA phages (MS2, f2, and R17) but not for Q 
beta. Temperature shift experiments showed that the growth of group I phage MS2 
in the mutant could be inhibited by a post-penetration event at high 
temperature. A possible role for the traD cistron of sex factor F in the 
intracellular development of MS2 is suggested.

tRNA isopentenyltransferase from Zea mays L. Characterization of the 
isopentenylation reaction of tRNA, oligo (A) and other nucleic acids.

Holtz J, Klämbt D.

The extraction and purification of the tRNA isopentenyltransferase from maize 
root tips and kernels are reported. The relative amounts of this enzyme in 
different organs of maize have been determined. Root tips have the highest 
enzyme activities, followed by kernels and young leaves. Old leaves exhibit very 
low activity. The molecular mass of the monomeric enzyme was determined to be 
57000 - 63000 dalton. pH and Mg2 optima are in full agreement with the data 
reported for the enzymes from yeast and Escherichia coli. Spermine enhances the 
isopentenylation of tRNA from kernels. The "Km" values of KMnO4-treated or 
untreated bulk tRNA from yeast and maize root tips and kernels were in the range 
of 10 to 34 micrometer while the Km values of of single species like tRNASer4 
from rat liver and tRNATyrKMnO4 from E. coli were 1.1 and 6.6 micrometer, 
respectively. The tRNA isopentenyltransferase from maize root tips and kernels 
catalyzes the incorporation of 2-isopentenyl groups into (Ap)3-7A, endogenous 
bulk oligonucleotos from maize root tips and kernels, and into poly(A), RNA from 
MS-2 phages and, to a very low extent, into adenosine. The Km values of (Ap)3-7 
A varied in the range of 250 to 750micrometer. Although oligonucleotides have 
less affinity to the enzyme, the formation of i6A within oligonucleotides may 
occur in vivo, due to their higher concentrations in cells.

The mechanism of the mutagenic action of hydroxylamine XIII. Reversion of phage 
MS2 amber mutants in the presence of hydroxylamines.

Budowsky EI, Klebanova LM, Metlitskaya AZ.

The replication of the phage MS2 in the presence of either hydroxylamine (HA) or 
O-methylhydroxylamine (OMHA) (mutagenesis in vivo) results in an increase in the 
reversion frequency of two amber mutations in the maturation protein. When 
acting on the extracellular phage (mutagenesis in vitro) the mutagens do not 
affect the reversion frequency. The most probable mode of mutagenic action of 
the hydroxylamines on the vegetative MS2 phage involves the enzymic formation of 
modified precursors and their incorporation into RNA.

Pattern and chance in the use of the genetic code.

Berger EM.

The use of triplet code words in E. coli, phiX174, MS2, and rabbit globin was 
examined. A significant deficiency of purines in the third position of four fold 
degenerate codons was noted, although its significance is not understood. There 
has been no consistent selection against uracil in pyrimidine restricted codons. 
For many amino acids the choice between code words appears random, while for 
arginine, isoleucine, and probably glycine, distinct biases exist which can be 
explained in terms of tRNA availability.

Serological characteristics of pili determined by the plasmids R711b and F0lac.

Bradley DE, Meynell E.

The plasmids R711b (at present IncX) and F0lac (IncFV) both determine pili 
morphologically like those of F (IncFI), and confer sensitivity to the 
F-specific filamentous bacteriophages, but not to the F-specific isometric RNA 
phages. Detailed serological studies show that the two pilus types are 
unrelated, and that neither is related to any of the previously defined F pilus 
serotypes. Adsorption of the isometric RNA phage MS2 to R711b pili occurs in the 
presence but not in the absence of formalin, which presumably prevents elution 
of reversibly adsorbed virions. No adsorption occurs with F0lac pili. MS2 
multiplication, as measured by titre increase tests in liquid medium, is found 
with neither plasmid. The two plasmids are not incompatible. These observations 
indicate that R744b and F0lac are different both from one another and from the 
plasmids belonging to the incompatibility groups IncFI--IV.

Determination of the first half of the coat protein cistron of bacteriophage 
Qbeta as an application of a mapping procedure for RNA fragments.

Escarmis C, Sastry PA, Billeter MA.

A method is described to classify, in regard to their location within the 
genome, fragments obtained by partial cleavage of 32P-labeled bacteriophage 
Qbeta RNA. The location of many fragments suitable for sequence analysis could 
be established using as markers 29 large RNase T1-resistant oligonucleotides 
with known map positions. Applying this method four fragments originating from 
the coat protein cistron were isolated and analyzed. The sequence of a segment 
of 239 nucleotides located immediately adjacent to the initiation triplet was 
determined to be 
G-C-A-A-A-A-U-U-A-G-A-G-A-C-U-G-U-U-A-C-U-U-U-A-G-G-U-A-A-C-A-U-C-G-G-G-A-A-A-G-A-U-G-G-A-A-A-A-C-A-A-A-C-U-C-U-G-G-U-C-C-U-C-A-A-U-C-C-G-C-G-U-G-G-G-G-U-A-A-A-U-C-C-C-A-C-U-A-A-C-G-G-C-G-U-U-G-C-C-U-C-G-C-U-U-U-C-A-C-A-A-G-C-G-G-G-U-G-C-A-G-U-U-C-C-U-G-C-G-C-U-G-G-A-G-A-A-G-C-G-U-G-U-U-A-C-C-G-U-U-U-C-G-G-U-A-U-C-U-C-A-G-C-C-U-U-C-U-C-G-C-A-A-U-C-G-U-A-A-G-A-A-C-U-A-C-A-A-G-G-U-C-C-A-G-G-U-U-A-A-G-A-U-C-C-A-G-A-A-C-C-C-G-A-C-C-G-C-U-U-G-C-A-C-U-G-C-A-A-A-C-G-G-U-U-C-U-U-Gp.

Refined molecular weights for phage, viral and ribosomal RNA.

Vollenweider HJ, Stettler U, Kübler O, Koller T, Weber H.

The RNAs of the Escherichia coli bacteriophages MS2 and Qbeta as well as E. coli 
16S ribosomal RNA were examined under identical conditions by electron 
microscopy using the protein-free benzyldimethylalkylammonium chloride (BAC) 
spreading technique. From the contour length ratios of the RNAs and the known 
number of nucleotides for MS2, the chain lengths for Qbeta RNA and 16S RNA were 
found to be 4790 +/- 150 and 1645 +/- 55 nucleotides. Correcting for the base 
composition of Qbeta RNA the molecular weight of the Na salt of this RNA is 
(1.64 +/- 0.06) . 10(6) daltons. Since published values on the relative lengths 
of Qbeta RNA and several other homogeneous RNAs (E. coli 23S rRNA, E. Coli 
bacteriophage R17 and f2 RNAs, Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage PP7 RNA and 
Newcastle disease virus RNA) are available, we are able to calculate the 
approximate number of nucleotides for these useful standards.

Bacteriophage MS2 RNA: a correlation between the stability of the codon: 
anticodon interaction and the choice of code words.

Grosjean H, Sankoff D, Jou WM, Fiers W, Cedergren RJ.

The non-random distribution of degenerate code words in Bacteriophage MS2 RNA 
can be explained partially by considerations of the stability of the 
codon-anticodon complex in prokaryotic systems. Supporting this hypothesis we 
note that wobble codons are positively selected in codons having G and/or C in 
the first two positions. In contrast, wobble codons are statistically less 
likely in codons composed of A and U in the first two positions. Analyses of 
nucleotides adjacent to 5' and 3' ends of codons indicate a nonrandom 
distribution as well. It is thus likely that some elements of RNA evolution are 
independent of the structural needs of the RNA itself and of the translated 
protein product.

Kinetics of initiation of bacterial protein synthesis.

Blumberg BM, Nakamoto T, Kézdy FJ.

The 30S initiation complex, formed with the 30S ribosomal subunit, mRNA, and 
fMet-tRNA, has been shown by kinetic analysis with limiting concentrations of 
Escherichia coli ribosomes to be an obligatory intermediate in the formation of 
the 70S initiation complex. The formation of the 70S initiation complex began 
with an induction period and was proportional to the concentration of the 30S 
complex, which rapidly rose to a peak. The entire time course of the sequential 
pseudo-first-order, second-order reaction was reproduced accurately by the 
overall rate expression, in which we used rate constants that were determined by 
carrying out 30S and 70S complex formation separately. By using limiting 
concentrations of mRNA, we showed that phage MS2 RNA contained no specific 
signal that enhanced its rate of 30S complex formation with E. coli ribosomes 
and initiation factors; the pseudo-first-order rate constants obtained with 
poly(A3C9G1U1), poly(C15G1U4), and poly(G1U3) were 12-45 times higher than that 
with MS2 RNA. The observation that the rate constants for binding of fMet-tRNA 
and AcPhe-tRNA with a given synthetic RNA were comparable indicated that the 
initiator codon is recognized only indirectly through the initiator tRNA.

Translational fidelity and specificity of ribosomes cleaved by cloacin DF13.

Twilt JC, Overbeek GP, van Duin J.

The effect of cloacin DF13 cleavage on several functional properties of the 
ribosome has been studied in a translational system in vitro. Cleaved ribosomes 
synthesize relatively shorter polypeptide chains on synthetic and natural 
templates. Their translational specificity is, however, unchanged as judged by 
the read-out of MS2 RNA. Here, cleaved as well as control ribosomes start 
translation only on the coat cistron of the phage RNA. Cloacin cleavage of 
ribosomes increases their fidelity of translation. Differential inhibition of 
translation of synthetic and natural template was not observed.

temperature-sensitive for suppression of a nonsense codon was studied for its 
ability to propagate phages T2, T4D, T5, phi K, f2, MS2, R17, Q beta, lambda as 
well as filamentous phages fl, fd and M13. Of all phages tested, only the growth 
of Q beta, lambda, and filamentous phages is inhibited in the mutant at 42 
degree C. This selective inhibition suggests that, like Q beta, lambda and 
filamentous phages also require a read-through proten(s) which results from 
suppression of a termination codon.

The regulatory region of MS2 phage RNA replicase cistron. IV. Functional 
activity of specific MS2 RNA fragments in formation of the 70 S initiation 
complex of protein biosynthesis.

Borisova GP, Volkova TM, Berzin V, Rosenthal G, Gren EJ.

The initiation region of the MS2 replicase cistron can be isolated as a fragment 
59 bases in length protected from RNAase by the binding of the coat protein 
which serves as a translational repressor. This fragment MS2 R(-53 leads to 6) 
starts 53 bases before the initiation codon and retains full activity in binding 
ribosomes. We have investigated the functional activity in initiation of a 
series of fragments from this region variously shortened from the 5'-end. 
Ribosome protected fragments starting 17 or 21 bases before the AUG are unable 
to rebind to ribosomes. The shortest fragment which has this activity was 
produced by partial S1 nuclease digestion and starts 33 to 35 bases before the 
AUG. The initiation signal comprises some nucleotides between 21 and 33 bases 
before the initiation codon and the regulatory region responsible for initiation 
is longer than that protected by the ribosome in the final initiation complex.

[Genetic control of the formation of plasmid F'. I. Effect of recA- and seg-2 
mutations in an Hfr donor strain on the character of plasmid F' formation].

[Article in Russian]

Gorelov VN, Il'ina TS, Smirnov GB.

Assuming the similarity of the processes of illegitimate recombination, such as 
deletion formation, with the process of F' plasmid formation, we have undertaken 
the study of the influence of recA- and seg- alleles of Hfr donor on the F' 
plasmid formation. The data obtained demonstrate the strong influence of donor 
genotype on the frequency of F' plasmid formation and on the nature of F' 
plasmids formed, thus demonstrating that the most of F' plasmids have been 
formed via recombination in Hfr donor cells. The recA- mutation decreased the 
total yield of F' plasmids selected using both proximal and distal Hfr markers 
and affected drastically the distribution of the F' plasmids inheriting 
different proximal unselected markers. The existence of recA-dependent and 
recA-independent modes of F' plasmid formation was demonstrated. The Escherichia 
coli chromosome contains regions which involve preferentially in recA-dependent 
(between proA and gal, and clockwise from gal) or recA-independent (between leu 
and proA, and the region counterclockwise from argE) recombination. The seg-2 
mutation causes only partial block of both recA-dependent and recA-independent 
recombination pathways, however it causes dramatic decrease of genetic exchanges 
leading to the formation of the type II F' plasmids. Both seg- and recA- 
mutations decrease the frequency of the formation of Tra+ F' transconjugants. 
The percent of Tra- transconjugants, which remain sensitive to MS2 and Q beta 
donor specific phages, also drops significantly under the influence of the recA- 
and seg- alleles. Thus, the recombination involving the F structure in wild type 
strains and seg- mutants occures preferentially in the points of F outside the 
regions essential for transfer and sensitivity to male specific phages, while in 
recA- and recA-ges- strains the points inside these regions (tra operon) 
frequently involved in F' plasmid looping out. There exist more strict 
correlation between the fertility and sensitivity to phage Q beta than to phage 
MS2.

Normal tRNAs promote ribosomal frameshifting.

Atkins JF, Gesteland RF, Reid BR, Anderson CW.

The addition of Ser AGC AGU tRNA to an E. coli cell-free protein synthesizing 
system which contains the endogenous tRNA levels results in up to 100% of the 
ribosomes translating the MS2 coat gene shifting into the -1 reading frame. An 
analogous phenomenon is seen at a much lower level without the tRNA addition, 
where a shift into the +1 frame can also be detected. Thus translation with the 
endogenous tRNA levels yields proteins which have the amino terminus of the coat 
protein but which are substantially larger than the coat protein and comprise 
about 5% of the coat translation. Since the lysis gene overlaps the 3' end of 
the coat gene in the +1 frame, we conclude that the reading frame shift into the 
+1 frame yields a hybrid protein. Also, we present evidence that ribosomes 
translating the synthetase gene shift into the -1 frame near the distal end of 
the gene. This frameshifting is promoted by thrACU ACC tRNA. Specific competitor 
tRNAs for both Thr and Ser tRNA-promoted frameshifting have been characterized. 
The generality of this new mechanism for producing additional proteins is 
unclear, but it investigation should increase understanding of the coding 
mechanism and its origin.

Crystallization of bacteriophage MS2.

Min Jou W, Raeymaekers A, Fiers W.

Crystals of bacteriophage MS2 have been obtained by slowly cooling a 1% virus 
solution from 23 degrees C to 0 degrees C in the presence of poly(ethylene 
glycol) 6000. The crystals were colorless, needle-like, anisotropic and very 
fragile. Electron microscopic observation of the crystals revealed a 
two-dimensional lattice of particles with RNA phage morphology and dimensions. 
Preliminary X-ray examination of the crystals confirmed their viral nature.

Influence of fulvic acid on bacteriophage adsorption and complexation in soil.

Bixby RL, O'Brien DJ.

The effect of fulvic acid, the major fraction of natural soluble organic matter, 
on the adsorption of MS2 bacteriophage to soil was investigated in controlled 
laboratory experiments. Batch experiments together with scanning electron 
microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray analysis showed that fulvic acid complexed 
phage, which prevented its adsorption to soil. Phage strongly adsorbed to soil 
in the absence of fulvic acid. Phage which was complexed with fulvic acid was 
not irreversibly inactivated and could become viable under proper conditions, 
illustrating the importance of assay and elution procedures in the recovery of 
virus from aqueous solutions.

Secondary structure of RNA from bacteriophages f2 Qbeta, and PP7.

Edlind TD, Bassel AR.

Electron microscopy of RNA-protein monolayers prepared under partial denaturing 
conditions has been used to compare the secondary structure of coliphage f2 and 
Qbeta and Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage PP7 RNAs. The secondary structure map of 
f2 RNA contains a central open loop and four symmetrically placed hairpins, 
which is similar to the pattern reported by Jacobson (A. B. Jacobson, Proc. 
Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 73:307-311, 1976) for the closely related phage MS2. 
With the same denaturing conditions, Qbeta RNA, which is 20% larger than f2 or 
PP7 RNA, has a central open loop and a smaller terminal loop. PP7 RNA has two 
large, closed secondary structures, one of which is nearly central. The base 
composition of PP7 RNA was determined and is similar to that of the group I 
coliphage RNAs. Thus, the greater amount of large base-paired structure is not 
related to an increased guanine-plus-cytosine content of PP7 RNA. With increased 
denaturing conditions, the central, closed structure of PP7 RNA is converted 
into an open loop. The central structures of all three phages include about 700 
nucleotides. The relevance of these findings to the genetic maps of the 
coliphage RNAs is discussed.

Binding of mammalian ribosomes to MS2 phage RNA reveals an overlapping gene 
encoding a lysis function.

Atkins JF, Steitz JA, Anderson CW, Model P.

The main binding site for mammalian ribosomes on the single-stranded RNA of 
bacteriophage MS2 is located nine tenths of the way through the coat protein 
gene. Translation initiated at an AUG triplet in the +1 frame yields a 75 amino 
acid polypeptide which terminates within the synthetase gene at a UAA codon, 
also in the +1 frame. Partial amino acid sequence analysis of the product 
synthesized in relatively large amounts by mammalian ribosomes confirms this 
assignment of the overlapping cistron. The same protein is made in an E. coli 
cell-free system, but only in very small amounts. Analysis of the translation 
products directed by RNA from op3, a UGA nonsense mutant of phage f2, identifies 
the overlapping cistron as a lysis gene. In this paper we show that the op3 
mutation is a C yield U transition occurring in the second codon of the 
synthetase cistron, which explains the lowered production of phage replicase (as 
well as lack of lysis) upon op3 infection of nonpermissive cells. We discuss the 
properties of the overlapping gene in relation to its lysis function, 
recognition of the lysis initiator region by E. coli versus eucaryotic ribosomes 
and op3 as a ribosome binding site mutant for the f2 synthetase cistron.

Secondary structure of MS2 phage RNA and bias in code word usage.

Hasegawa M, Yasunaga T, Miyata T.

Based on the secondary structural model of MS2 RNA, it is shown that, in 
base-pairing regions of the RNA, there is a bias in the use of synonymous codons 
which favours C and/or G over U and/or A in the third codon positions, and that 
in non-pairing regions, there is an opposite bias which favours U and/or A over 
C and/or G. This nature is interpreted as a result of selective constraint which 
stabilises the secondary structure of the single-stranded RNA genome of the MS2 
phage.

The cytogenetic, proliferative and viability effects of four bacteriophages on 
human lymphocytes.

Wenger SL, Turner JH, Petricciani JC.

Certain bacteriophages have been found in live virus vaccines, while a few 
others have been associated with disease states. Some of these phages have 
produced abnormal growth of eukaryotic tissue cultures. For this reason 
bacteriophages phiX-174, MS2, T2 and an isolate from live virus vaccines, 
phiV-1, were incubated with human cell cultures for examination of chromosomal 
effects, cell proliferation and viability. Mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes and 
human embryonic kidney tissue cultures showed no increase in chromosomal 
abnormalities for high doses of phage-infected versus control cultures. 
Tritiated-thymidine uptake, correlated with mitotic indices for phage-treated 
lymphocyte cultures, indicated a reduction in cell division, while 51-chromium 
release studies showed no cell death occurring in these cultures. This suggested 
that inhibition of DNA synthesis was occurring in some cells. The presence of 
phage in the supernate of cells that were exposed to phage suggested the 
possibility of phage attachment to the plasma membranes of lymphocytes, which 
may in turn affect the suppression of DNA synthesis.

The enzymic addition of poly(A) to the 3'-end of RNA using bacteriophage MS 2 
RNA as a model system.

Devos R, Gillis E, Fiers W.

ATP : RNA adenyltransferase, purified from Escherichia coli, was used to add a 
series of adenosine residues to the 3'-end of MS2RNA. Incubations of the order 
of a few minutes at 37 degrees C were sufficient for synthesis of a short 
poly(A) chain that did not appreciably alter the hydrodynamic or electrophoretic 
properties of MS2 RNA. The size of the poly(A) tails was estimated by gel 
electrophoresis after prior hydrolysis of the primer RNA with pancreatic 
ribonuclease. These results were in good agreement with the values calculated on 
the basis of the relative amount of incorporated AMP. After the addition of a 
short poly(A) tail, approximately 50% of the treated material binds specifically 
to an oligo(dT)-cellulose column. The majority of the recovered 
poly(a)-containing RNA was still intact, as shown by analysis on polyacrylamide 
gel. After incubations beyond 6 min, slowly sedimenting material, also showing 
reduced electrophoretic mobility, was formed. Presumably this material 
corresponds to RNA chains to which long poly(A) tails are linked.

[Transfection of Escherichia coli using bacteriophage MS2 RNA].

[Article in Russian]

Grabovskaia KB, Golubkov VI.

The authors present materials for comparison of three methods of E. coli 
infection by the RNA of the MS2 bacteriophage. The cells accepted the RNA at the 
stage of spheroplasts (obtained with the aid of a lysozyme and EDTA) with the 
efficacy of up to 1.5 X 10(5) IC/mug of the RNA. Diethylpyrocarbonate was used 
as a transfection stimulant. The product of transfection was identical to the 
MS2 bacteriophage. The efficacy of transfection in the calcinated system and on 
the frozen-defrosted bacteria was lower than on the spheroplasts (10(2) IC/mug 
of the RNA) which was largely associated with the formation of "latent 
infectious centres". Formation of latent negative colonies was characteristic of 
bacteriophage MS2, but formation of these colonies was intensified when 
calcinated cells were used for transfection.

Mode of action of bottromycin A2. Release of aminoacyl- or peptidyl-tRNA from 
ribosomes.

Otaka T, Kaji A.

Bottromycin A2 inhibited MS2 phage RNA-dependent protein synthesis as well as 
polyuridylic acid-(poly(U))- or polyadenylic acid (poly(A))-dependent 
polypeptide synthesis. When the ribosomal complex with 
N-acetyl-[14C]phenylalanyl-tRNA (N-acetyl-[14C]Phe-tRNA) at the A site was 
subjected to bottromycin A2, the release of N-acetyl-[14C]Phe-tRNA was observed 
while no release of N-acetyl-[14C]Phe-tRNA from the donor site was observed, 
indicating that the action of bottromycin A2 is specific to the A site of 
ribosomes. Due to bottromycin's capacity to release [14C]Phe-tRNA or 
N-acetyl-[14C]Phe-tRNA from the ribosomal acceptor site (A site), bottromycin A2 
inhibited the nonenzymatic binding of N-acetyl-[14C]Phe-tRNA and elongation 
factor T (EF-T)-dependent binding if the concentration of 
EF-Tu-GTP-[14C]Phe-tRNA ternary complex was low. Our data are consistent with 
the possibility that the inhibition of overall polypeptide synthesis by 
bottromycin A2 is at least partly due to bottromycin A2's activity to release 
aminoacyl- or oligopeptidyl-tRNA from ribosomes. Among 10 antibiotics tested, 
bottromycin A2 and lincomycin released aminoacyl-tRNA from ribosomes.

Patterns of E. coli leucine tRNA isoacceptors following bacteriophage MS2 
infection.

Di Natale P, Eilat D.

The RNA extracted from MS2 phage particles can accept radioactive leucine and 
serine in the presence of tRNA activating enzymes. Leucine acceptance is due to 
the presence of E. coli leucine tRNA that binds very tightly to the virus 
particle. RPC-5 column chromatography shows that the pattern of virus associated 
leucyl-tRNA isoacceptors is different from that of normal E. coli leucyl-tRNA. 
It is also different from the pattern of host leucyl-tRNA isoacceptors found in 
E. coli lysate following MS2 phage infection. The RPC-5 pattern of the latter 
tRNA shows several new peaks of leucine tRNA isoacceptors. The possibility that 
these tRNAs are some modified forms of normal leucine tRNA isoacceptors is 
suggested.

Allocation of 15 RNase T1-resistant large oligonucleotides of MS2 RNA.

Fuke M.

Four large MS2 RNA fragments with the original 5'-end were obtained by limited 
RNase T1 digestion. The lengths of the fragments were 36, 30, 22, and 19% of the 
whole molecule. Whole MS2 RNA and the four fragments were completely digested 
with RNase T1 and analyzed by the two-dimensional "homochromatography 
fingerprint" technique. Sixteen oligonucleotides of MS2 RNA were separated and 
the oligonucleotides were assigned to the fragments. Fifteen of the sixteen 
oligonucleotides could be classified into three regions of the cistrons of 
bacteriophage MS2.

The effect of host-cell starvation on virus-induced lysis by MS2 bacteriophage.

Propst-Ricciuti B.

Infection of glucose, sulphur or nitrogen starved cells with MS2 virus results 
in the production of progeny virus but the absence of cell lysis and the failure 
of progeny virus release. Addition of glucose of sulphur to the correspondingly 
starved cells results in the normal release of virus within 40 to 60 min. Return 
of nitrogen to nitrogen-starved cells, however, does not result in the release 
of virus, even after 1 1/2 h. In experiments with uninfected, starved cells it 
was found that glucose or sulphur starved cells begin dividing within 45 min 
after the limiting compound is returned. In contrast, nitrogen-starved cultures 
have not begun to divide 1 1/2 after the return of nitrogen. The correlation 
between the time it takes for starved, infected cultures to resume lysis after 
the return of the limiting compound and the time similarly starved, but 
infected, cells normally begin division after addition of the limiting compound 
supports the hypothesis that lysis by RNA phage is related to cell division and 
may result at the time of cell division from failure of the cells to divide 
properly.

[Resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides in gram negative 
bacteria. 1. Molecular and genetic characterization of R-factors (author's 
transl)].

[Article in German]

Schmid B, Kayser FH.

With frequent use of aminoglycoside antimicrobials and beta-lactam antibiotics 
in hospitals in the last few years, the number of bacterial strains resistant to 
these chemotherapeutics increased. Lately, strains of E. coli, Klebsiella, 
Enterobacter, Serratia, Proteus and Pseudomonas resistant to many antimicrobials 
(ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, gentamycin, 
tobramycin, sisomycin, neomycin, paromomycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, 
spectinomycin, tetracycline, sulphonamides) were isolated from patients of the 
university hospital in Zuerich. The resistant phenotype of two representative 
strains (Klebsiella pneumoniae 1 and Serratia marcescens 2) could be transferred 
by mixed cultivation to E. coli K-12. Multiple resistance of strain 1, and 
addition, could be transferred to Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescens, 
Providencia, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae in varying frequencies. 
Transfer to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, could not be achieved. Spontaneous 
instability of resistance was observed in 0.15% of the cells of an overnight 
brothe culture and in 90% of the cells of a three months old culture. 
Conjugation, instability and the response to the sex phages MS-2 and If-1 
suggested that resistance was mediated by a monomolecular R-factor, belonging to 
the fi+-type. This suggestion was confirmed by molecular characterization of the 
resistance plasmids. After transfer of the R-factors of K. pneumoniae 1 (R-FK 1) 
and Serratia marcescens 2 (R-FK2) into E. coli K-12, plasmid DNA was labelled 
with (methyl-3H) thymidine, and isolated by isopycnic centrifugation in 
cesiumchlorid-ethidium-bromide. Analysis of plasmid DNA then was carried out by 
sedimentation in a 5-20% neutral sucrose gradient together with reference 
plasmids of known molecular weights and sedimentation constants. The analysis 
revealed that R-FK1 had a molecular weight of 54 X 10(6) and R-FK2 of 50 X 10(6) 
daltons. The values were confirmed by contour length measurements of open 
circular forms with an electron microscope. A comparison of the sedimentation 
profile of labelled plasmid DNA from strain 1 and 14C-labelled DNA of E. coli 
K-12 (R-FK1) showed that the wild-type strain contained, besides the large 
resistance plasmid, at least two smaller "cryptic" plasmids. These smaller 
plasmid molecules were also found in antibiotic susceptible variants of strain 
1, which did not contain the 54 X 10(6) dalton plasmid molecule, responsible for 
the resistant phenotype. The number of copies of R-FK1 in E. coli K-12 was 
determined to be 2, indicating stringent control of replication. It is discussed 
that the growing number of isolations of strains of Escherichia, Klebsiella, 
Serratia, Proteus, Providencia and Pseudomonas, exhibiting the same resistance 
phenotype, results from the spread of the R-factor described above among the

Undermethylated transfer RNA does not support phage RNA-directed in vitro 
protein synthesis.

Stulberg MP, Sutton M, Isham KR.

A cell-free protein synthesis system from Escherichia coli Q13 was depleted of 
mRNA and tRNA so that restoration of maximum activity was dependent of the 
addition of these components. Protein synthesis, directed by either MS2 or Qbeta 
phage RNA, was stimulated significantly by the addition of normal tRNA from 
either E. coli Q13 or B. In contrast, undermethylated tRNA from 
methionine-starved E. coli RCrel did not cause this stimulation. It is concluded 
that undermethylated tRNA Lacks sufficient base modifications to function in 
protein synthesis.

Cooperative effects of initiation factors and fMet-tRNA in the formation of the 
40-S initiation complex.

van der Hofstad GA, Foekens JA, Van Den Elsen PJ, Voorma HO.

In this paper the mode of action of IF-1 in 40-S initiation complex formation 
was studied with MS2 RNA as messenger. Using initiation factors IF-2 and IF-3 
labeled in vitro it appeared that IF-1 did not influence the binding of these 
factors in the absence of fMet-tRNA. However, in the presence of fMet-tRNA it 
was found that the enhancement of the fMet-tRNA binding by IF-1 was accompanied 
with an equimolar increase in binding of IF-2. Moreover, it appeared that also 
in absence of IF-1, fMet-tRNA binding is coupled with an equimolar enhancement 
of the IF-2 binding, which suggests the existence of a preribosomal complex 
between IF-2 and fMet-tRNA. The apparent Km values for both the binding of 
fMet-tRNA and IF-2 to 30-S subunits were determined and appeared to be equal, 
which makes a functioning of such a preribosomal complex in protein initiation 
very likely. The participation of GTP in this complex will be discussed. 
Functions of IF-1 in dissociation and recycling of IF-2, described by others, 
and the stimulation on the 30-S subunit level might well be explained as 
pleiotropic effects of one basic action of IF-1, i.e. a conformational change of 
30-S subunits.

Doublet frequencies and codon weighting in the DNA of Escherichia coli and its 
phages.

Elton RA, Russell GJ, Subak-Sharpe JH.

A compilation of nucleic acid sequences from E. coli and its phages has been 
analysed for the frequency of occurrence of nearest neighbour base doublets and 
codons. Several statistically significant deviations from random are found in 
both doublet and codon frequencies. The deviations in E. coli also appear to 
occur in lambda and in the coat protein gene of MS2, whereas T4 and other parts 
of the MS2 genome show different sequence properties. These and other findings 
are discussed in relation to the hypothesis that rapidity of translation of 
mRNAs in the E. coli system is dependent on doublet frequency and codon usage 
patterns.

3'-Terminal nucletide sequence (n equals 361) of bacteriophage MS2 RNA.

Vandenberghe A, Min Jou W, Fiers W.

32P-Labeled MS2 RNA was partially digested with ribonuclease T1 
(guanyloribonuclease; ribonucleate 3'-guanylo-oligonucleotidohydrolase; EC 
3.1.4.8) or with epilson-carboxymethyl-lysine-41 pancreatic ribonuclease A 
(ribonucleate 3'-pyrimidino-oligonucleotidohydrolase; EC 3.1.4.22). A series of 
overlapping fragments was obtained which allowed the reconstruction of a 
361-nucleotide-long 3'-terminal sequence. A unique reading frame could be 
deduced, which indicated that the replicase gene ends with a U-A-G termination 
signal and is followed by a 174-nucleotide-long untranslated segment.

Mechanism of inactivation of bacteriophage MS2 containing single-stranded RNA by 
ascorbic acid.

Murata A, Uike M.

The mechanism of inactivation of a single-stranded RNA phage, MS2, by AsA was 
investigated as a part of the studies on the mechanism of inactivation of 
viruses by AsA. Investigations on the effects of oxygen, oxidizing or reducing 
agents, metals or chelating agents, and free radical scavengers on the 
inactivation of the RNA phage by AsA indicated that the free radical 
intermediates formed during the course of oxidation of AsA are responsible for 
the inactivation of the phage. Hydrogen peroxide and DAsA themselves had no 
effect on the infectivity of the phage. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation 
analyses indicated that the reactive radicals react with the phage RNA to cause 
strand scissions in the RNA.

'Nearest neighbor' base pairs (doublets') in the protein-coding regions of MS2 
RNA have been tabulated with respect to their positions in the first two bases 
of amino acid codons, in the second two bases, or paired by contact between 
adjoining codons. tconsiderable variation is evident between numbers of doublets 
in each of these three possible positions, but the totals of each of the 16 
doublets in the coding regions of the MS2 RNA molecule show much less varation.

Electron microscopic studies of purified eukaryote messenger RNA.

Naora H, Fry KE.

Rat liver mRNA, hen and rabbit globin messenger RNA (mRNA) were investigated by 
electron microscopy. No secondary structures were visible in the molecules of 
these mRNAs under conditions where short secondary structures of other types of 
RNA, i.e. MS2 phage RNA and 28 S rRNA, were clearly demonstrated. The contour 
lengths of these mRNAs were also determined by electron microscopy and compared 
with the sizes estimated by other techniques. The contour lengths of rabbit 
short and long globin mRNA are 0.1498 +/- 0.0019 and 0.1908 +/- 0.0021 
micrometer, respectively. The former is assumed to be globin mRNA for alpha 
chain and the latter for beta chain. Similarly, hen "alpha" and "beta" globin 
mRNA have mean lengths of 0.1449 +/- 0.0011 and 0.1891 +/- 0.0017 micrometer, 
respectively. Hen and rabbit reticulocytes contain 1.8-2.0 times as much mRNA 
for alpha globin chains as for beta.

sequence of the tryptic peptides.

Nolf FA, Vandekerckhove JS, Lenaerts AK, Van Montagu MC.

The A-protein of coliphage MS2 was purified to a state of sufficient homogeneity 
to study its primary structure. The NH2-terminal sequence was determined for the 
first 8 residues. Comparison with the reported sequence of R17 protein (Weiner, 
A. M., Platt, T., and Weber, K. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 3242-3251) shows a 
difference at position 6 where alanine in R17 is replaced by threonine in MS2. 
The COOH-terminal sequence was shown to be -Arg-Leu-Ser-Arg, confirming the 
existence of UAG as the termination codon of the maturation protein (Comtreras, 
R., Ysebaert, M., Min Jou, W., and Fiers, W. (19731 Nature New Biol. 241,

and Q beta].

[Article in Russian]

Bauman VR, Markushevich VN, Kish AZ, Gren EIa.

The yield of the phage QB is always less than the yield of the phage MS2, the 
conditions of cultivation being similar. This is due to the fact that the yield 
of the phage QB from an infection centre is lower by a factor of 5--10 than the 
yield of the phage MS2. The yield of the phages may be increased by optimizing 
conditions of cultivation. The RNA-containg phages MS2 and QB were cultivated in 
the peptone-yeast growth medium in fermenters with the working volume of 30 and 
50 litres. The yields were 2--5-10(13) particles/ml and 1--4-10(12) particles/ml 
for the phages MS2 and QB, respectively. The specific infectiveness of purified 
phage preparations was 2--4-10(12) particles/OD260 (MS2) and 2--4-10(11) 
particles/OD260 (QB).

Genetic nature of morphologic mutants of RNA-containing phage MS2].

[Article in Russian]

Bespalova IA, Kriviskiĭ AS, Tikhonenko AS, Sherban TP.

Temperature-sensitive "leaky" mutants of phage MS2 having white dense ring 
around negative colonies are described. As these mutants are used for 
quantitative genetic studies, the white ring presents interest. Typical mutant 
40 is used as a model for investigation. Light microscopy has shown, that cells 
from white ring zone have spore-like inclusions, which determine the 
characteristic structure of surrounding mutant negative colonies. Cytochemical 
reactions for the presence of glicogen, lipids, volutin, nuclear material and 
spores were negative. Electrone microscopy of negatively stained samples and 
ultrathin sections has revealed that cells from white ring zone, unlike 
phage-infected wild type cells, have two types of electron dense inclusions: 1) 
crystalline structures formed with great number of closely packed mature phage 
particles, and 2) large amorphic bodies. Electrone microscope-cytochemical data 
showed that inclusions remain intact under treatment of ultrathin sections of 
white zone ring with DNase and perchloric acid, while nuclear material was 
completely destroyed. Amorphic bodied were completely destructed after the 
treatment with RNase, while nuclear material and crystalline phage aggregated 
remained unchanged. Therefore, amorphic bodies consist of RNA, which has not 
been used to form virions. Single cycle of the development of mutant 40 at 37 
degrees and 43 degrees C and under the temperature of incubation 37 degrees 
leads to 43 degrees C and 43 degrees leads to 37 degrees C in the course of 
intracellular reproduction is investigated. Influence of the phage on growth on 
infected culture is studied. The data obtained draw to a conclusion that the 
impaired function belongs to cystron protein of the phage membrane. As certain 
mutations in this cystrone of RNA-containing phage result in the depression of 
cystrone RNA polymerase, it is supposed that the formation of RNA containing 
bodies in infected cells, determining the formation of white rings in NA, 
together with cristalline aggregates of cells, is a result of mutation damage of 
cystrone protein of the phage MS2 membrane.

Is there selection against wobble in codon-anticodon pairing?

Fitch WM.

Among amino acid codons that require a third-position pyrimidine, there is a 
significant bias favoring the use of cytidine over uracil in MS2 phage RNA. This 
could arise from selection against wobble pairing in the interaction of transfer 
RNA and messenger RNA. Among amino acid codons with fourfold degeneracy, there 
is a bias favoring pyrimidines over purines.

Studies on secondary structure of single-stranded RNA from bacteriophage MS2 by 
electron microscopy.

Jacobson AB.

A method allowing the demonstration and study by electron microscopy of 
secondary structure of viral RNA has been developed. Single-stranded RNA from 
the bacteriophage MS2 has been analyzed in the electron microscope in the 
presence of various concentrations of MgCl2. Depending on the salt 
concentration, the molecules display one to three large open loops which range 
in size from 10 to 20% of the total RNA length, and smaller closed loops which 
are approximately 3-5% of the total RNA length. Within one spreading, the 
conformation of the molecules is variable. However, the average complexity of 
the molecules increases with increasing salt, and individual loops which are 
infrequent at low salt increase in frequency with increasing salt. By analyzing 
the manner in which the individual loop appeared, it was possible to show that 
all molecules could be described by one basic pattern of secondary structure 
formation.

Bacteriophage MS-2 in the immune response.

Snippe H, de Reuver MJ, Belder M, Willers JM.

Several aspects of the immune response to bacteriophage MS-2 were studied. In 
thymectomized, irradiated and bone marrow-reconstituted (TXBM) mice, the 
response was normal when a high dose of antigen was used. With a 50-fold lower 
dose of MS-2, the response was impaired, indicating a T-cell involvement in 
antibody formation. More evidence for the (partial) T-cell dependence of MS-2 
was obtained from experiments with anti-thymocyte serum or 
cyclophosphamide-treated mice. (3H)-thymidine incorporation experiments 
demonstrated that both B and T cells were active upon in vitro stimulation with 
MS-2. The dose of MS-2 which was able to induce a normal response in TXBM mice, 
proved to be optimal for both sensitization and elicitation of a DH. It is 
concluded that MS-2 is a thymus-dependent antigen which is only thymus 
independent in high doses.

Growth of bacteriophages MS2 and T7 on streptomycin-resistant mutants of 
Escherichia coli.

Chakrabarti S, Gorini L.

Streptomycin-resistant mutants of an Hfr strain of Escherichia coli K were 
examined for their ability to support the growth of male-specific ribonucleic 
acid phage MS2 and female-specific deoxyribonucleic acid phage T7. Normally, the 
Hfr strain allows propagation of MS2 and is lysed by it (efficiency of plating 
equal to 1), whereas the same strain restricts propagation of T7 and is not 
lysed by it (efficiency of plating smaller than 10-7). Twenty-four isolates out 
of 26 independently obtained streptomycin-resistant mutants are partially or 
completely derestricted for propagation of T7; efficiency of plating of T7 in 
such strains ranges from 10-3-1. Depending on their response to plating of MS2 
and T7, the streptomycin-resistant mutants can be divided into four classes. The 
mutants in all four classes continue to be "male" in conjugation with F- 
strains. Genetic analysis is presented to show that restriction of MS2, 
derestriction of T7, and resistance to streptomycin are the pleiotropic effects 
of a single mutation at the strA locus.

Modification of E. coli ribosomes and coliphage MS2 RNA by bisulfite: effects on 
ribosomal binding and protein synthesis.

Braverman B, Shapiro R, Szer W.

The reaction of E. coli 70s ribosomes with 0.2 M NaH-35 s03 (pH 7.1, 3.5hrs, 37 
degree) led to the conversion of 4.5% of the uracil residues of the R, RNA into 
5.6-dihydrouracil-6-sulfonate residues. The modified ribosomes exhibited a 
significant decrease in their ability to bind (14-C)-phenylalanyl-(RNA-phe and 
to incorporate (14-C)-phenylalanine into protein in the presence of polyuridylic 
acid. The ability of the modified ribosomes to form an initiation complex as 
measured by the A-U-G or coliphage MS2 RNA dependent binding of 
(14-C)-fmet-tRNA-fmet was also impaired, as was their ability to incorporate 
(14-C) lysine into protein with MS2 RNA as messenger. Treatment os MS RNA with 
0.2 M sodium (35-S) bisulfite, pH 7.0 at 25 degrees C resulted in the 
substitution of 2.7% and 6.2% of the uracil residues by bisulfite after 1 and 
3.5 hrs of reaction, respectively. Impairment of function of the MS2 RNA in both 
initiation complex formation and transplantation assays was observed. These 
reactions of uracil residues of mRNA and rRNA may be a cause of biological 
damage inflicted by sodium bisulfite and sulfur dioxide.

Amplification of sex repressor function of one fi-+ R-factor during anaerobic 
growth of Escherichia coli.

Burman LG.

It has been reported by Mitsuhashi (1965) that transfer of one R-factor was 
completely inhibited by anaerobic transfer conditions. In contrast, several 
workers have observed R-factor transfer, although at a reduced rate, in the 
animal intestines, a largely anaerobic environment. It is shown here that in 
vitro transfer of the R-factor R1 (F-type pilus, fi-+) in Escherichia coli K-12 
is severely depressed, whereas transfer of R64 (I-type pilus, fi-minus) is 
slightly stimulated by anaerobiosis. Inhibition of R1 fertility is dependent on 
anaerobic conditions during pregrowth of the donor cells, whereas the oxygen 
tension during recipient pregrowth, transfer, and plating is of little 
importance. Anaerobic pregrowth has a less inhibitory effect on the fertility of 
R1drd19, a mutant of R1 having a defective sex repressor. The fi-+ property of 
R1 when introduced into F' or Hfr bacteria is amplified during anaerobic growth. 
These observations strongly indicate that the sex repressor is the mediator of 
the anaerobic fertility inhibition of the R-factor R1. This hypothesis was 
supported by studies of the formation of sex pili, the only gene product 
identified that is controlled by the sex repressor of R1. Using propagation of 
the F-type pilus-specific phage MS2 as a measure of the degree of sex piliation 
of a bacterial population, it is shown that in anaerobic cultures sex piliation 
due to R1 is strongly repressed, whereas piliation due to R1drd19 is repressed 
to a lesser extent. The possible survival value of the response of R1 towards 
oxygen tension is discussed.

Discriminative effect of rifampin of RNA replication of various RNA 
bacteriophages.

Engelberg H, Brudo I, Israeli-Reches M.

Rifampin interferes exclusively with RNA replication in vivo of the group I 
phages MS2, f2, and R17, whereas QbetaRNA replication is unaffected by the drug. 
In addition, rifampin has a discriminative effect of group I phage RNA 
replication. In the experimental system employed by us the antibiotic 
differentially interferes with the synthesis of minus RNA strands in f2, whereas 
it has almost no effect on the synthesis of progeny plus strands. In MS2, the 
drug differentially arrests the synthesis of progeny plus strands and almost 
fails to affect the synthesis of minus RNA strands. In R17 both steps of its RNA 
replication are affected by rifampin, although each step is only partially 
(approximately 50%) inhibited. The relation of the present results to the 
possible role of bacterial proteins and tertiary structure of phage RNA in the 
process of template recognition is discussed.

Fate of MS2 proteins synthesized in Escherichia coli exposed to amino acid 
analogues.

Prouty WF.

Incorporation of an analoque into MS2 coded proteins prevents the maturation of 
phages. In addition, there is an alteration in the relative amount of coat 
protein to replicase protein synthesized, which supports the hypothesis that 
normal coat protein serves a physiological role as a translation repressor. 
Further, abnormal proteins, synthesized from the phage genome, are degraded, 
presumably by a host catabolic system, more rapidly than the normal gene 
products.

F-Factor-mediated restriction of bacteriophage T7: protein synthesis in 
cell-free systems from T7-infected Escherichia coli F- and F+ cells.

Yamada Y, Nakada D.

A characteristic phenomenon in the F-factor-mediated inhibition of T7 phage is a 
virtual absence of T7 late protein synthesis in T7-infected Escherichia coli 
male cells, in spite of the presence of T7 late mRNA which is translatable in 
vitro when isolated from the cell. To determine whether the translational defect 
in T7-infected F+ cells is due to a T7 late mRNA-specific translational block, 
or to a general decrease of F+ cell translational activity, we compared the 
activities of cell-free, protein-synthesizing systems prepared from isogenic F- 
and F+ cells harvested at different times of T7 infection. The cell-free systems 
from uninfected F- and F+ cells translated T7late mRNA equally as well as MS2 
RNA and T7early mRNA. The activity of cell-free systems from T7-infected F+ 
cells to translate MS2 RAN, T7 early mRNA, and T7 late mRNA decreased 
concomitantly at a much faster rate than that of T7-infected F- cells. 
Therefore, the abortive infection of F+ cells by T7 does not result from a T7 
late mRNA-specific translational inhibition, although a general reduction of the 
translational activity appears to be a major factor for the inability of the F+ 
cells to produce a sufficient amount of T7 late proteins.

Doublet frequencies in sequenced nucleic acids.

Elton RA.

A doublet frequency count (set of frequencies of the 16 possible two-base 
sequences) can be calculated from the experimentally determined overall sequence 
of a nucleic acid. In this paper, a statistical methodology is developed for 
comparing such counts with random, with others of the same type or with doublet 
proportions found in whole DNAs. The methods are applied to two major categories 
of sequenced RNAs. It is found that vertebrate ribosomal and transfer RNAs show 
significant differences from the overall vertebrate DNA pattern, especially in 
the frequency of the doublet CG. Bacterial rRNA and tRNA, on the other hand, 
show less dissimilarity from total DNA. In the RNA of the small bacteriophage 
MS2, the doublet frequencies of the translated regions of the genome resemble 
those in the host E. coli, whereas those in the intercistronic regions differ 
substantially. All these findings are discussed in relation to the origin, 
evolution and selection of the nucleic acids concerned.

The synthetase gene of the RNA phages R17, MS2 and f2 has a single UAG 
terminator codon.

Atkins JF, Gesteland RF.

Translation of the RNA from the wild-type bacteriophages R17, MS2, and f2 in 
bacterial cell-free extracts containing an amber suppressor yields 30-40% of the 
synthetase with an approximate molecular weight of 63 500, slightly larger than 
the major synthetase product (63 000 daltons). The occurrence of the 63 500 
dalton in vitro product is dependent on the presence of an amber suppressor, and 
we predict that it is due to read-through of a UAG termination codon at the end 
of the synthetase gene. Previous results of Capecchi and Klein (Nature, 226, 
1029-1033, 1070) showed that antibodies to both release factors RF1 and RF2 are 
required to block release of synthetase, suggesting that synthetase is released 
at a UAA codon. If the interpretations of both experiments are correct, the 
termination and release may not be synonomous and may be spatially separated. In 
addition there is the unexplained fact that 7% of the synthetase made in vitro 
in both su+ and su- extracts with either R17, MS2 or f2 as template has an 
apparent molecular weight of 66 000.

S1 nuclease hydrolysis of single-stranded nucleic acids with partial 
double-stranded configuration.

Rushizky GW, Shaternikov VA, Mozejko JH, Sober HA.

The single-strand specific nuclease S1 from Aspergillus oryzae (EC 3.1.4.21) was 
purified 600-fold in 16% yield from dried mycelia. Determination of the 
isoelectric point of S1 nuclease as 4.3-4.4 allowed adjustment of 
chromatographic conditions such that the enzyme was isolated free of 
contaminating ribonucleases T1 and T2. S1 nuclease so purified was used for 
removal of single-stranded portions from the RNA of the Escherichia coli phage 
MS2, which has a helical content of about 65% in vitro. At 23 degrees, 
increasing amounts of enzyme converted the RNA to mononucleotides in about 
equimolar base ratios. No small intermediates of chain length 2-8 were found. At 
0 degrees, MS2 RNA hydrolysis was slower and reached, in exhaustive digests, a 
plateau where 70% of the substrate RNA remained insoluble in 66% EtOH. With 
[32P]MS2 RNA, strip chart counting of 6% acrylamide-6 M urea electrophoresis 
patterns of such digests gave recoveries of 80-91% in the form of defined 
oligomer bands. On 2.5% acrylamide-0.5% agarose gels, the molecular weights of 
the major oligomers were found to range from 25,000 to 41,000. Similar to 
purified tRNAArg used as a control, these oligomers were not resistant to 
pancreatic RNase-RNase T1 hydrolysis at 37 degrees, and were not bound on 
hydroxylapatite at 50 degrees in 0.14 M sodium phosphate (pH 6.8). Melting of 
the oligomers gave complex profiles without a clear Tm and showed an increase in 
A260 of 35% at 93 degrees over that at 28 degrees. Upon formaldehyde 
denaturation of MS2 RNA prior to S1 nuclease hydrolysis, no resistant oligomers 
were found.

Recovery from allotype suppression in rabbits and release from this suppression 
in specific immune response.

Seto A, Mori KJ, Ito Y.

The recovery of allotypic expression in allotype suppressed rabbits was followed 
up in specific antibodies and in bulk immunoglobulins. The primary antigenic 
stimulation with BSA and/or MS2 phage was given at 4 weeks of age. In the early 
recovery group, where the recovery from suppression began at 11-13 weeks of age, 
specific antibodies bearing the suppressed allotype were found to be synthesized 
by the primary stimulation or with successive allotype was scarely expressed in 
specific antibodies despite its recovered expression in bulk immunoglobulins. 
The X-ray irradiation followed by the immunization procedures promoted the 
recovery of the suppressed allotype expression in anti-BSA antibody and in bulk 
immunoglobulins but not in anti-MS2 phage antibody. The results are discussed in 
terms of regulatory mecahnisms of immune response in allotype suppressed 
animals.

[Defective bacteriophage MS2 particles containing specific RNA FRAGMENTS].

[Article in Russian]

Renkhof RF, Veselov SV, Iansone IV, Gren EIa.

Two types of MS2 particle are revealed when phage lysates are banded in CsCl 
density gradient. The lower band contain normal phage particles with a density 
of 1.46 g/cm3. The upper band with a density of 1.44 g/cm3 containes uninfective 
incomplete MS2 particles. Both phage types reveal no abnormalities in the 
content of the coat protein and A-protein. They are nearly identical in RNA 
content. RNA in the normal buoyant density phage particles is native. RNA in the 
defective particles consists of three specific fragments with molecular weights 
6.5-10(5), 5.5-10(5) and 4.4-10(5) and molar ratios 5:4:9 respectively. THE 
5'-TERMINAL ANALYSIS OF RNA from defective MS2 particles reveals the presence of 
native pppGp. THE 3'-TERMINAL ANALYSIS OF THE INDIVIDUAL RNA fragments reveals 
the presence of adenosine only in the shortest fragment. RNA fragmentation in 
defective particles can be explained by the action of intracellular RNAses on 
the unprotected regions on RNA chain in structurally incomplete virions.

Induced formation of covalent bonds between nucleoprotein components. V. UV or 
bisulfite induced polynucleotide-protein crosslinkage in bacteriophage MS2.

Budowsky EI, Simukova NA, Turchinsky MF, Boni IV, Skoblov YM.

UV (lambda = 254 nm) irradiation of bacteriophage MS2 or its treatment with 
bisulfite induce covalent crosslinkage of the RNA to the coat protein. 
epilsonN-(2-oxopyrimidyl-4)-lysine was found in the phage hydrolysates after 
either type of treatment. An equimolar mixture of 0-methylhydroxylamine and 
bisulfite causes complete disappearance of the cross-links. This led to the 
conclusion that one of the factors responsible for the UV-induced 
polynucleotide-protein crosslinkage and the main factor in treatment with 
bisulfite is substitution of the exocyclic amino group of the activated cytosine 
nucleus by the lysine residue epilson-amino group of the protein.

Complete nucleotide sequence of bacteriophage MS2 RNA: primary and secondary 
structure of the replicase gene.

Fiers W, Contreras R, Duerinck F, Haegeman G, Iserentant D, Merregaert J, Min 
Jou W, Molemans F, Raeymaekers A, Van den Berghe A, Volckaert G, Ysebaert M.

Bacteriophage MS2 RNA is 3,569 nucleotides long. The nucleotide sequence has 
been established for the third and last gene, which codes for the replicase 
protein. A secondary structure model has also been proposed. Biological 
properties, such as ribosome binding and codon interactions can now be discussed 
on a molecular basis. As the sequences for the other regions of this RNA have 
been published already, the complete, primary chemical structure of a viral 
genome has now been established.

Inactivation of coliphage MS-2 and poliovirus by copper, silver, and chlorine.

Laboratory, Whittier, CA 90601.

The efficacy of electrolytically generated copper and silver ions (400 and 40 
micrograms/L, respectively) was evaluated separately and in combination with 
free chlorine (0.2 and 0.3 mg/L) for the inactivation of coliphage MS-2 and 
poliovirus type 1 in water at pH 7.3. The inactivation rate was calculated as 
log10 reduction/min: k = -(log10 Ct/C0)/t. The inactivation of both viruses was 
at least 100 times slower in water containing 400 and 40 micrograms/L copper and 
silver, respectively (k = 0.023 and 0.0006 for MS-2 and poliovirus, 
respectively), compared with water containing 0.3 mg/L free chlorine (k = 4.88 
and 0.036). Significant increases in the inactivation rates of both viruses were 
observed in test systems containing 400 and 40 micrograms/L copper and silver, 
respectively, with 0.3 mg/L free chlorine when compared with the water systems 
containing either metals or free chlorine alone. Poliovirus was approximately 10 
times more resistant to the disinfectants than coliphage MS-2. This observation 
suggests either a synergistic or an additive effect between the metals and 
chlorine for inactivation of enteric viruses. Use of copper and silver ions in 
water systems currently used in swimming pools and spas may provide an 
alternative to high levels of chlorination.

Bacteriophage lysis: mechanism and regulation.

Young R(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Texas A&M University, College 
Station 77843.

Bacteriophage lysis involves at least two fundamentally different strategies. 
Most phages elaborate at least two proteins, one of which is a murein hydrolase, 
or lysin, and the other is a membrane protein, which is given the designation 
holin in this review. The function of the holin is to create a lesion in the 
cytoplasmic membrane through which the murein hydrolase passes to gain access to 
the murein layer. This is necessary because phage-encoded lysins never have 
secretory signal sequences and are thus incapable of unassisted escape from the 
cytoplasm. The holins, whose prototype is the lambda S protein, share a common 
organization in terms of the arrangement of charged and hydrophobic residues, 
and they may all contain at least two transmembrane helical domains. The 
available evidence suggests that holins oligomerize to form nonspecific holes 
and that this hole-forming step is the regulated step in phage lysis. The 
correct scheduling of the lysis event is as much an essential feature of holin 
function as is the hole formation itself. In the second strategy of lysis, used 
by the small single-stranded DNA phage phi X174 and the single-stranded RNA 
phage MS2, no murein hydrolase activity is synthesized. Instead, there is a 
single species of small membrane protein, unlike the holins in primary 
structure, which somehow causes disruption of the envelope. These lysis proteins 
function by activation of cellular autolysins. A host locus is required for the 
lytic function of the phi X174 lysis gene E.

The asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase gene encodes one of the complementing factors 
for thermosensitive translation in the Escherichia coli mutant strain, N4316.

Escherichia coli strain N4316 is a mutant that exhibits temperature-sensitive 
growth at 43 degrees C and temperature-sensitive translation in vivo and in 
vitro. Extracts of the mutant produce an aberrant pattern of translation 
products of MS2 bacteriophage RNA. Previous work has shown that a protein, 
called 'rescue', isolated from the parental strain partly corrects the defective 
translation in vitro. Here we report the purification to homogeneity of a second 
factor from ribosomal eluates of the wild-type parental strain; the purified 
protein is a homodimer of 54 kDa. The partial sequence of the second protein was 
determined, and a recombinant plasmid was isolated based on its ability to 
complement the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype of the mutant at the 
non-permissive temperatures. The cloned gene was sequenced, mapped to the 
20.9-min region of the E. coli chromosome and shown to code for a 466-amino-acid 
protein with a molecular mass of 52 kDa. Analysis of the DNA sequence and the 
correspondence to that of the partial protein sequence has identified the 
complementing factor as asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase. Marker rescue experiments 
indicate that the asnS mutation in N4316 resides within the motif 2 domain of 
the synthetase. A potential role of this synthetase in restoring normal protein 
synthesis with respect to ribosomal frameshifting, read-through of nonsense 
codons and protein copy number is discussed.

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Rev activation can be achieved without 
Rev-responsive element RNA if Rev is directed to the target as a Rev/MS2 fusion 
protein which tethers the MS2 operator RNA.

Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.

The posttranscriptional trans activation of unspliced or partially spliced human 
immunodeficiency virus RNAs by the Rev regulatory protein is crucial for virus 
replication and is dependent on sequence-specific RNA binding by Rev. The 
cognate RNA target of Rev is contained within a highly structured, 
244-nucleotide Rev-responsive element (RRE) RNA in the viral env gene. Here, we 
show that specific interaction with the RRE is not an absolute requirement for 
Rev function. When the RRE is replaced by a heterologous MS2 phage operator 
sequence, Rev will facilitate the cytoplasmic expression of human 
immunodeficiency virus mRNAs containing this sequence if directed to the MS2 
operator via the RNA binding motif of the MS2 phage coat protein (MS-C) as a 
Rev/MS-C fusion protein. Rev/MS-C efficiently activated both RRE and MS2 
targets. A mutation in the MS2 operator that abolished the coat protein binding 
in vitro rendered the mutant RNA nonresponsive to the fusion protein in vivo. 
Notwithstanding that Rev can be tethered to the viral RNAs via another RNA 
binding motif, the structural integrity of the N terminus of Rev was still 
required for optimal trans activation.

Genetic analysis of mutations affecting terminase, the bacteriophage lambda DNA 
packaging enzyme, that suppress mutations in cosB, the terminase binding site.

Cue D(1), Feiss M.

Author information:
(1)Department of Microbiology, University of Iowa, Iowa City 52242.

Terminase, the DNA packaging enzyme of phage lambda, binds to lambda DNA at a 
site called cosB, and introduces staggered nicks at an adjacent site, cosN, to 
generate the cohesive ends of virion lambda DNA molecules. Terminase also is 
involved in separation of the cohesive ends and in binding the prohead, the 
empty protein shell into which lambda DNA is packaged. Terminase is a 
DNA-dependent ATPase, and both subunits, gpNu1 and gpA, have ATPase activity. 
cosB contains a series of gpNu1 binding sites, R3, R2 and R1; between R3 and R2 
is a binding site, I1, for integration host factor (IHF), the Escherichia coli 
DNA bending protein. In this work, a series of mutations in Nu1 have been 
isolated as suppressors of cosB mutations. One of the Nu1 mutations is identical 
to the previously described Nu1ms1/ohm1 mutation predicted to cause the change 
L40F in the 181 amino acid-long gpNu1. Three other Nu1 missense mutations, the 
Nu1ms2 (L40I), ms3 (Q97K) and ms4 (A92G) mutations, have been isolated; the 
relative strengths of suppression of cosB mutations by the Nu1ms mutations are: 
ms1 > ms2 > ms3 > ms4. The Nu1 missense mutations all affect amino acid residues 
that lie outside of the putative helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif of gpNu1. 
The Nu1ms1 and Nu1ms2 mutations alter an amino acid residue (L40) that lies 
directly between two segments of gpNu1 proposed to be involved in ATP binding 
and hydrolysis; thus these mutations are likely to alter the gpNu1 ATP-binding 
site. The Nu1ms3 and Nu1ms4 mutations both affect amino acid residues in the 
central region of gpNu1 that is predicted to form a hydrophilic alpha-helix. To 
explain how the Nu1ms mutations suppress cosB defects, models involving 
alterations of the DNA binding and/or catalytic properties of terminase are 
considered. The results also indicate that terminase occupancy of a single gpNu1 
binding site (R3) is necessary and sufficient for the efficient initiation of 
DNA packaging; the Nu1ms1, ms2 and ms3 mutations permit IHF-independent plaque 
formation by a phage lacking R2 and R1.

Bacteriophage and spliceosomal proteins function as position-dependent cis/trans 
repressors of mRNA translation in vitro.

Stripecke R(1), Hentze MW.

Author information:
(1)European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany.

The translational regulation of ferritin expression currently represents the 
only well characterized example for eukaryotic translational control by high 
affinity interactions between a specific cytoplasmic protein, iron regulatory 
factor [IRF], and an mRNA-binding site, the iron-responsive element [IRE], 
located in the 5' untranslated region [UTR] of ferritin mRNAs. To elucidate 
whether IRE/IRF may represent the first physiological example of a more general 
mechanism for mRNA-specific translational control, high affinity RNA-binding 
sites for the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein or the spliceosomal protein U1A 
were introduced into the 5' UTR of capped chloramphenicol acetyltransferase 
[CAT] transcripts. In the absence of these RNA-binding proteins, CAT mRNA was 
efficiently translated. Addition of purified MS2 coat protein or U1A caused a 
specific, dose-dependent repression of CAT biosynthesis in rabbit reticulocyte 
and wheat germ in vitro translation systems. The translational blockage imposed 
by the RNA/protein complex was reversible and did not alter the stability of the 
repressed mRNAs. Translational repression caused by binding of U1A or MS2 
proteins to their target mRNAs is shown to be position-dependent in vitro. Thus, 
mRNA/protein complexes without an a priori role in eukaryotic mRNA translation 
function as translational effectors with characteristics resembling those of 
IRE/IRF.

Characterization by mass spectrometry of a recombinant hepatitis delta virus 
antigen and its proteolytic products.

Tecce MF(1), Petracca R, Giuliani MM, Ruoppolo M, Marino G, Malorni A, Pucci P.

Author information:
(1)Sclavo Research Center, Siena, Italy.

The recombinant hepatitis delta virus antigen was obtained as a chimaeric 
protein fused to the C-terminus of the phage MS2 RNA polymerase. Following 
induction of the temperature-sensitive promoter, two major polypeptides of about 
34 kDa and 29 kDa, and two minor peptides about 21 kDa and 18 kDa, were obtained 
on PAGE. The 34-kDa protein was identified as the expected recombinant protein 
by confirming 82% of the primary structure using fast-atom-bombardment mass 
spectrometry. The most represented degradation product, i.e. the 29-kDa 
polypeptide, was also characterized by means of mass spectrometry and found to 
be produced by cleavage between amino acids 261 and 265. The presence of two 
main protein bands, with a similar difference in size, is also a typical feature 
of delta antigens, both extracted and recombinant, and it is considered to be 
derived either from heterogeneity of viral sequences, which can encode hepatitis 
delta antigen proteins of 195 and 214 amino acids, or from proteolysis of a 
single precursor. Since the data were obtained with a single viral sequence 
coding for 195 amino acids fused to 106 residues from MS2 polymerase, there is 
direct evidence that intrinsic structural properties of the protein sequence are 
able to cause a specific proteolysis resulting in the presence of two major 
forms, of which the smaller is 35-40 amino acids at the C-terminus. The 
recombinant protein can be used as an antigenic substitute of viral antigens 
both for immunoassays and for the preparation of anti-(hepatitis delta virus) 
antisera.

Control of translational repression by protein-protein interactions.

Peabody DS(1), Ely KR.

Author information:
(1)Department of Cell Biology, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, 
Albuquerque 87131.

The coat protein of the RNA bacteriophage MS2 is a translational repressor and 
interacts with a specific RNA stem-loop to inhibit translation of the viral 
replicase gene. As part of an effort to dissect genetically its RNA binding 
function, mutations were identified in the coat protein sequence that suppress 
mutational defects in the translational operator. Each of the mutants displayed 
a super-repressor phenotype, repressing translation from the wild-type and a 
variety of mutant operators better than did the wild-type coat protein. At least 
one mutant probably binds RNA more tightly than wild-type. The other mutants, 
however, were defective for assembly of virus-like particles, and 
self-associated predominantly as dimers. It is proposed that this assembly 
defect accounts for their super-repressor characteristics, since failure to 
assemble into virus-like particles elevates the effective concentration of 
repressor dimers. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that deletion 
of thirteen amino acids known to be important for assembly of dimers into 
capsids also resulted in the same assembly defect and in super-repressor 
activity. A second class of assembly defects is also described. Deletion of two 
amino acids from the C-terminus of coat protein resulted in failure to form 
capsids, most of the coat protein having the apparent molecular weight expected 
of trimers. This mutant (dl-8) was completely defective for repressor activity, 
probably because of an inability to form dimers. These results point out the 
inter-dependence of the structural and regulatory functions of coat protein.

Effect of the method of preparing monochloramine upon inactivation of MS2 
coliphage, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae.

Monochloramine prepared in situ by first adding chlorine to a suspension of 
microorganisms, followed by subsequent addition of ammonia, inactivated the MS2 
coliphage more rapidly than did exposure of phage to monochloramine prepared 
either by adding chlorine to ammonia or by adding chlorine and ammonia 
simultaneously. The rapid viral inactivation was apparently due to the exposure 
of MS2 to free chlorine before the addition of ammonia. The average 99% CT value 
of MS2 when exposed to free chlorine was 1.3 and 1.1 at 5 and 15 degrees C, 
respectively. The average 99% CT values of MS2 briefly exposed to the combined 
action of free chlorine followed by the addition of ammonia to form 
monochloramine in situ were 19.3 and 1.5 at 5 and 15 degrees C, respectively. No 
99% CT values were calculated for the inactivation of MS2 with preformed 
monochloramine because less than 1 log (90%) of inactivation occurred during a 
4-h contact time. Inactivation of MS2 by monochloramine was more rapid at 15 
than at 5 degrees C and when the chlorine to nitrogen weight ratio was 5:1 
compared with 3:1. Monochloramine was a more efficient inactivating agent for 
the coliforms Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae than it was for the MS2 
coliphage.

Failure to trigger the autolytic enzymes in minicells of Escherichia coli.

F.R.G.

Minicells from Escherichia coli P678-54 are refractory towards procedures known 
to induce bacteriolysis of DNA-containing E. coli cells. Although still engaged 
in murein synthesis, minicells could not be lysed by penicillin G. Likewise, 
endogenous overproduction of the cloned soluble lytic transglycosylase, the 
predominant murein hydrolytic activity in E. coli, failed to lyse minicells. 
Furthermore, induction of the phage MS2 lysis protein, a hydrophobic protein 
assumed to trigger the autolytic system of the host, did not result in 
bacteriolysis. It is concluded that the murein hydrolases present in minicells 
are under a tight cellular control.

mRNA containing an extended Shine-Dalgarno sequence is translated independently 
of ribosomal protein S1.

(1)Moscow State University, Russia.

The role of ribosomal protein S1 in the translation of mRNA containing an 
extended Shine-Dalgarno sequence was investigated. Using the toeprinting 
technique, formation of the ternary initiation complex between 30S subunits, 
both S1-depleted or treated with anti-S1 antibodies, and mini-mRNA containing 
the 9 nucleotide-long Shine-Dalgarno sequence was studied. It was concluded that 
the initiation of translation on mRNA with an extended Shine-Dalgarno sequence 
is S1-independent. It was demonstrated that S1-depleted ribosomes effectively 
translate the cro-mini-mRNA in a cell-free system. In contrast to cro-mini-mRNA, 
30S subunits without protein S1 are inactive in ternary initiation complex 
formation with, and cell-free translation of, MS2 or fr phage RNAs and RNA 
protein III of phage fd.

Ribosomes play an active role in protein biosynthesis. Ribosomal RNA 
conformation in ribosomal subunits, intramolecular interactions between 
different rRNA sequences within the confinement of the particles, and 
intermolecular interactions are presumed necessary to support efficient and 
accurate protein synthesis. Here we report an analysis of the disposition of 16S 
rRNA conserved zones centered about positions 525, 1400, and 1500 in 30S 
subunits. Complementary oligodeoxyribonucleotides in conjunction with nuclease 
S1 digestion were used to do this. All of the sequences examined in 30S subunits 
are accessible to DNA probes of 9 to 12 nucleotide residues in length. However, 
the kinetic characteristics of the respective DNA interactions with 30S 
particles vary significantly. In addition to the investigation of normal 30S 
particles, a four base deletion within the 1400 region of 16S rRNA was analyzed. 
The deletion was made by using synthetic DNAs to target the deletion site for 
RNase H digestion. The direct in vitro procedure for manipulating rRNA conserves 
nucleotide modifications. The alteration causes a significant change in the 
disposition of 16S rRNA in 30S subunits, suggesting a reduction in the freedom 
of movement of the altered zone in the particle. In a factor-dependent in vitro 
protein synthesis system primed with MS2 mRNA and altered 30S subunits, there 
was a 50% decrease in phage coat protein synthesis. The reduction could be due 
to a decrease in the rate of translation or premature termination of 
translation. We present evidence here, based on isotopic studies, which supports 
the latter possibility.

Comparative inactivation of poliovirus type 3 and MS2 coliphage in demand-free 
phosphate buffer by using ozone.

Finch GR(1), Fairbairn N.

Author information:
(1)Department of Civil Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.

MS2 coliphage (ATCC 15597-B1) has been proposed by the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency as a surrogate for enteric viruses to determine the 
engineering requirements of chemical disinfection systems on the basis of 
previous experience with chlorine. The objective of this study was to determine 
whether MS2 coliphage was a suitable indicator for the inactivation of enteric 
viruses when ozone disinfection systems were used. Bench-scale experiments were 
conducted in 2-liter-batch shrinking reactors containing ozone demand-free 0.05 
M phosphate buffer (pH 6.9) at 22 degrees C. Ozone was added as a side stream 
from a concentrated stock solution. It was found that an ozone residual of less 
than 40 micrograms/liter at the end of 20 s inactivated greater than 99.99% of 
MS2 coliphage in the demand-free buffer. When MS2 was compared directly with 
poliovirus type 3 in paired experiments, 1.6 log units more inactivation was 
observed with MS2 coliphage than with poliovirus type 3. It was concluded that 
the use of MS2 coliphage as a surrogate organism for studies of enteric virus 
with ozone disinfection systems overestimated the inactivation of enteric 
viruses. It is recommended that the regulatory agencies evaluate their 
recommendations for using MS2 coliphage as an indicator of enteric viruses.

A model system which would closely reflect the resistance of poliovirus but 
could be easily performed in any microbiology laboratory would offer 
considerable advantages for rapidly screening hand decontamination products. The 
use of the bacteriophage MS2 as a simple model for virucidal testing has been 
evaluated. In suspension tests the sensitivity of MS2 to alcohols, organic acids 
and alkalis generally reflected that observed in studies using poliovirus. MS2 
could be applied and recovered from the hands of volunteers with high 
efficiency. Furthermore MS2 proved to be a suitable replacement for Escherichia 
coli in a standard hand-decontamination test.

Hyperreactivity of adenines and conformational flexibility of a translational 
repression site.

We have used a diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) modification [(1976) Prog. Nucl. 
Acids Res. 16, 189-262] to probe the accessibility of adenines essential for 
coat protein binding in the MS2 translational operator [(1983) Biochemistry 22, 
2601-2610, 2610-2615, 4723-4730; (1987) Biochemistry 26, 1563-1568]. The 
essential adenines are apparently hyperreactive with this reagent relative to 
other sites within the same molecule. Variation of ionic strength, pH and 
divalent cation concentrations reveal the existence of two distinct conformers 
of the RNA operator as judged by DEPC reactivity. We propose that the 
hyperreactivity observed is due to the participation of neighbouring bases in 
the DEPC modification reaction and can be used as a novel structural probe.

Four phloroglucinol derivatives, named mallotophenone 
(5-methylene-bis-2,6-dihydroxy-3-methyl-4-methoxyacetophenone), mallotochromene 
(8-acetyl-5,7-dihydroxy-6-(3-acetyl-2,4- 
dihydroxy-5-methyl-6-methoxybenzyl)-2,2-dimethylchromene), mallotojaponin 
(3-(3,3(dimethylallyl)5-(3(acetyl-2,4- 
dihydroxy-5-methyl-6-methoxybenzyl)-phloracetophenone) and mallotolerin 
(3-(3-methyl-2-hydroxybut-3-enyl)-5(3-acetyl-2,4- 
dihydroxy-5-methyl-6-methoxybenzyl)-phloracetophenone), have been tested for 
their ability to inhibit the activity of human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV)-reverse transcriptase. Under the reaction conditions with (rA)n.(dT)12-18 
as the template.primer, the enzyme activity was inhibited by approximately 70% 
in the presence of 10 micrograms/ml mallotochromene or mallotojaponin, whereas 
mallotophenone and mallotolerin were much less inhibitory to the enzyme. The 
enzyme activity was also inhibited, though to lesser extent, by these compounds 
under similar conditions with initiated MS-2 phage RNA as the template.primer. 
The mode of inhibition was, as analyzed with mallotojaponin, competivite with 
respect to the template.primer, (rA)n.(dT)12-18, and non-competitive with 
respect to the triphosphate substrate, dTTP. The Ki value of mallotojaponin for 
HIV-reverse transcriptase was determined to be 6.1 microM.

N3-Methyl derivative of 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine 5'-triphosphate (Me-AZTTP) 
showed a potent inhibitory effect on HIV-1 reverse transcriptase using MS2 phage 
RNA as the template. The inhibition mechanism of MeAZTTP was noncompetitive with 
respect to any of the template MS2 RNA, dATP and dCTP. On the other hand, 
MeAZTTP showed a mixed-type inhibition with respect to dGTP and dTTP. These 
results indicate that MeAZTTP competes not only with dTTP but also with dGTP.

Effects of organic matter on virus transport in unsaturated flow.

Author information:
(1)Department of Soil and Water Science, University of Arizona, Tucson 85721.

The effects of natural humic material and sewage sludge organic matter (SSOM) 
derived from primary treated sewage sludge on virus transport by unsaturated 
flow through soil columns were evaluated. Bacteriophage MS-2 was applied to 
loamy fine sand columns 0.052 m in diameter and 1.05 m long. Virus 
concentrations in the influent and effluent were measured daily for 7 to 9 days. 
In the first experiment, virus transport through two fresh soil columns was 
compared with that through a column previously leached with more than four pore 
volumes (T) of well water. The soil water organic matter concentrations in the 
leachate of the fresh soil declined with time. Relative virus concentrations 
(C/Co) from one fresh soil column reached 0.82 in 0.9 T and then declined to 
0.51 by 2.1 T. The other fresh soil column reached and maintained a steady-state 
relative virus concentration [(C/Co)s] of 0.47 from 1.5 to 2.5 T. The leached 
column reached and maintained a (C/Co)s of 0.05. Concentrations measured at 
0.2-, 0.4-, 0.8-, and 1.05-m depths indicated that most virus particles were 
removed in the surface 0.2 m. In the second experiment, one leached column was 
pretreated with SSOM derived from primary treated sewage sludge and the other 
leached column was untreated. SSOM concentrations declined with depth. A 
suspension of virus and SSOM in well water was applied to both columns. Although 
the (C/Co)s values were similar (0.41 for the pretreated column and 0.47 for the 
untreated column), breakthrough was delayed for the untreated column. Both 
natural humic material and sewage sludge-derived SSOM increased the 
unsaturated-flow transport of MS-2.

Structure determination of the bacteriophage MS2.

The structure of the bacterial virus MS2 has been solved at 3.3 A resolution. 
Initial phases to 13 A resolution were obtained from a model based on the known 
coordinates of the plant virus southern bean mosaic virus. These phases were 
extended in small steps to a resolution of 3.4 A. The phases obtained 
represented essentially the Babinet opposite of the true structure and were not 
of a sufficiently good quality to allow an interpretation of the electron 
density contoured at negative levels. Difference Fourier maps of two heavy-atom 
derivatives based on these phases were interpretable, and these derivatives were 
used to calculate isomorphous replacement phases at 8.8 A resolution. Phase 
extension to 3.3 A resolution led to maps which could be easily interpreted.

Potassium salts influence the fidelity of mRNA translation initiation in rabbit 
reticulocyte lysates: unique features of encephalomyocarditis virus RNA 
translation.

Jackson RJ(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, U.K.

It is widely assumed that in vitro translation of mRNA is more efficient in the 
presence of potassium acetate rather than KCl, that the optimum concentration of 
potassium acetate is higher than for KCl, and that uncapped RNAs exhibit a lower 
optimum salt concentration than capped mRNAs. When these assumptions were 
examined using several different mRNA species in four batches of rabbit 
reticulocyte lysate, some notable exceptions were found. The translation of 
encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) RNA exhibited a salt optimum unusually high 
for an uncapped mRNA, and was very much more efficient and accurate with KCl 
rather than potassium acetate. It was also unique in being strongly activated by 
low concentrations (5-10 mM) KSCN in the presence of 90 mM potassium acetate. 
For the translation of other uncapped RNAs (poliovirus RNA, cowpea mosaic virus 
(CPMV) M RNA and bacteriophage MS2 RNA) amino acid incorporation at the optimum 
potassium acetate level was significantly greater than could be achieved using 
KCl. However, KCl was found to be restrictive and potassium acetate permissive 
for the synthesis of abnormal products thought to arise from initiation at 
incorrect sites, with the result that KCl gave a product pattern closer to that 
observed in vivo. In the particular case of the reticulocyte lysate system, 
accurate translation therefore requires the use of KCl rather than potassium 
acetate, but the choice of salt was found to be less critical in cell-free 
extracts from HeLa or L-cells.

The influence of the initial concentration of beta-propiolactone, the 
composition of the solution, temperature, and pH on the bacteriophage MS2 
infectivity inactivation kinetics has been studied. Rate constants have been 
determined for the infectivity inactivation and for the change in the 
concentration (the consumption) of the reactant under inactivation conditions. 
These constants have been shown to permit a sufficiently precise description of 
the phage MS2 survival curves under the action of beta-propiolactone. These data 
have been used to put forward a kinetic approach for the rational determination 
of conditions for inactivation of the viral infectivity to a required extent 
with agents whose concentration decreases during inactivation as a result of 
hydrolysis and reactions involving the medium components.

Secondary structure of coliphage Q beta RNA. Analysis by electron microscopy.

Jacobson AB(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Microbiology, State University of New York, Stony Brook 
11794-8621.

The secondary structure of genomic RNA from the coliphage Q beta has been 
examined by electron microscopy in the presence of varying concentrations of 
spermidine using the Kleinschmidt spreading technique. The size and position of 
structural features that cover 70% of the viral genome have been mapped. The 
structural features that are visualized by electron microscopy in Q beta RNA are 
large. They range in size from 170 to 1600 nucleotides. A loop containing 
approximately 450 nucleotides is located at the 5' end of the RNA. It includes 
the initiation region for the viral maturation protein. A large hairpin 
containing approximately 1600 nucleotides is located in the center of the 
molecule. It is multibranched and includes most of the viral coat gene, the 
readthrough region of the A1 gene, and approximately one third of the viral 
replicase gene. Within the central hairpin, the initiation region for the viral 
replicase gene pairs with a region within the distal third of the viral coat 
gene. This structure may participate in the regulation of translational 
initiation of the viral replicase gene. Two structural variants of the central 
hairpin were observed. One of them brings the internal S and M viral replicase 
binding regions into juxtaposition. These observations suggest that the central 
hairpin may also participate in the regulation of translation of the viral coat 
gene. The secondary structures that are observed in Q beta RNA differ 
significantly from structures that we described previously in the genomic RNA of 
coliphage MS2 but are similar to structures we observed by electron microscopy 
in the related group B coliphage SP.

Trans-dominant Tat mutants with alterations in the basic domain inhibit HIV-1 
gene expression.

Author information:
(1)Division of Hematology-Oncology, UCLA School of Medicine 94143.

The Tat protein of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is required 
for efficient viral gene expression. By means of mutational analyses, several 
domains of the Tat protein that are required for complete activation of HIV-1 
gene expression have been defined. These include an amino-terminal activating 
domain, a cysteine-rich dimerization domain, and a basic domain important in the 
binding of Tat to the trans-activation response element (TAR) and in Tat nuclear 
localization. Recently, we described a mutation, known as delta tat, which 
resulted in a protein with a truncated basic domain. This protein had a 
"trans-dominant" phenotype in that it inhibited wild-type Tat activation of the 
HIV-1 LTR. To further characterize the requirements for generating a Tat 
trans-dominant phenotype, we constructed a variety of Tat proteins with 
truncations or substitutions in the basic domain. A number of these proteins 
showed a trans-dominant phenotype. These Tat mutants also inhibited activation 
of the HIV-1 LTR by a protein composed of Tat fused to the prokaryotic R17 
(phage MS2) RNA-binding protein in which the R17 recognition element was 
inserted in the HIV-1 LTR in place of TAR. Thus, an intact TAR element was not 
required for this inhibition. We also studied the cellular localization of Tat 
and a trans-dominant Tat mutant by means of immunofluorescence staining with the 
use of antibodies reactive to different domains of the Tat protein. The results 
indicated that Tat becomes localized predominantly in the nucleus both in the 
presence and absence of the trans-dominant Tat construct, suggesting that the 
trans-dominant mutant does not inhibit Tat nuclear localization. These studies 
further define the requirements for the creation of trans-dominant Tat mutants, 
and suggest that the mechanism of trans-dominant Tat inhibition may be either 
the formation of an inactive complex between wild-type and mutant Tat or 
sequestration of cellular factors involved in regulating HIV-1 gene expression.

of North Texas, Fort Worth 76107.

Minus strand RNAs of phages MS2 and Q beta, prepared by in vitro transcription, 
were each separated into two forms on nondenaturing agarose gels. Only a single 
form of RNA was observed for minus strands denatured with glyoxal prior to 
agarose analysis, demonstrating that the two forms were conformers in each case. 
Truncated and elongated versions of these RNAs, analyzed under nondenaturing 
conditions, demonstrated that a region of RNA complementary to the A protein 
gene was at least partially responsible for the presence of these conformers in 
both MS2 and Q beta minus strands.

Translational repression by bacteriophage MS2 coat protein expressed from a 
plasmid. A system for genetic analysis of a protein-RNA interaction.

Peabody DS(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Cell Biology, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, 
Albuquerque 87131.

The coat protein of bacteriophage MS2 is a translational repressor. It inhibits 
the synthesis of the viral replicase by binding a specific RNA structure that 
contains the replicase translation initiation region. In order to begin a 
genetic dissection of the repressor activity of coat protein, a two-plasmid 
system has been constructed that expresses coat protein and a 
replicase-beta-galactosidase fusion protein from different, compatible plasmids 
containing different antibiotic-resistant determinants. The coat protein 
expressed from the first plasmid (pCT1) represses synthesis of a 
replicase-beta-galactosidase fusion protein encoded on the other plasmid (pRZ5). 
Mutations in the translational operator or in coat protein result in 
constitutive synthesis of the enzyme. This permits the straightforward isolation 
of mutations in the coat sequence that affect repressor function. Because of the 
potential importance of cysteine residues for RNA binding, mutations were 
constructed that substitute serines for the cysteine residues normally present 
at positions 46 and 101. Both of these mutations result in translational 
repressor defects. Chromatographic and electron microscopic analyses indicate 
that the plasmid-encoded wild-type coat protein forms capsids in vivo. The 
ability of the mutants to adopt and/or maintain the appropriate conformation was 
assayed by comparing them to the wild-type protein for their ability to form 
capsids. Both mutants exhibited evidence of improper folding and/or instability 
as indicated by their aberrant elution behavior on a column of Sepharose CL-4B. 
Methods were developed for the rapid purification of plasmid-encoded coat 
protein, facilitating future biochemical analyses of mutant coat proteins.

We have expressed two cDNA sequences encoding 121 and 230 amino acids of the 
C-terminus of the Schistosoma mansoni Hsp 70 in Escherichia coli. The products 
were synthesized as polypeptides fused to the RNA polymerase of bacteriophage 
MS2, and their reactivities were tested in ELISAs, using sera from human and 
murine infections. Anti-Hsp70 antibodies were detected in a significant number 
of individuals suffering from chronic schistosomiasis mansoni, but not in 
patients with known recent infections. This, together with the finding that 
antibodies directed at S. mansoni-specific Hsp70 determinants during the course 
of infection of experimental mice were not detectable until 5-6 weeks 
post-infection, suggests that the protein may be a useful marker for 
distinguishing late and early infections. The diagnostic specificity of Hsp70 
was evaluated with sera from humans infected with different schistosome species 
and other parasitic diseases. While some subjects infected with S. haematobium 
produced antibodies which recognized the S. mansoni Hsp70, no such antibodies 
were generated in S. japonicum infected individuals. However, cross-reactive 
antibodies were elicited in donors with other parasitic diseases such as 
filariasis and malaria. The absence of antibodies in early infection and the 
observed cross-reactivities led us to conclude that Hsp70 will be of limited 
value in the diagnosis of schistosomiasis.

Escherichia coli DNA helicase I. Characterization of the protein and of its 
DNA-binding properties.

Biologie, Heidelberg, Federal Republic of Germany.

Gene traI of the Escherichia coli F sex factor which encodes DNA helicase I was 
subcloned in a lambda pL-based plasmid vector and expressed in a background of 
pL non-repressing cells. Neither the non-repressed pL promoter nor the 
production of a high level of functional helicase I are toxic. Enzyme purified 
from this source was studied in the electron microscope. The results show that 
helicase I binds cooperatively to single-stranded DNA. DNA covered with the 
helicase appears in fixed, negatively stained specimens as a smooth-contoured 
filament with a diameter of 12.5 +/- 0.4 nm and an axial periodicity of 7.0 +/- 
0.2 nm. In unfixed specimens, discrete particles with axes of 12.7 +/- 0.5 nm 
and 7.2 +/- 0.5 nm are visible. They are consistent in size with helicase I 
monomers (Mr 180,000) suggesting that the molecule is almost isometric, despite 
a frictional ratio of 1.71 calculated from its diffusion coefficient. Helicase I 
free of DNA appears as aggregates. For comparison, a truncated traI, lacking 
coding for the amino-terminus of the product, was cloned by fusing it to an MS2 
replicase gene fragment. The chimeric gene product (named helicase I del29) 
retains strand-separating activity although it fails to show cooperative DNA 
binding behavior. Judged from the length of the helicase-I-specific sequence of 
this polypeptide, traI is located 1.3 kb nearer to the distal end of the F 
transfer operon compared to the position proposed in a previous genetic map. The 
revised location of traI has implications for understanding distal functions of 
the transfer operon.

Expression of Agrobacterium rhizogenes rolB gene fusions in Escherichia coli: 
production of antibodies against the RolB protein.

Sapienza, Italy.

Expression of the rolB gene of Agrobacterium rhizogenes TL-DNA is sufficient to 
trigger root differentiation in transformed plant cells. To investigate the role 
of RolB in differentiation, a large portion of rolB, comprising about 90% of its 
C-terminal coding sequence, was cloned into vectors pEX34 and pEA305 in frame 
with the truncated N termini of the pL-MS2 phage DNA polymerase and, 
respectively, the ptac-c Its phage lambda repressor gene. Hybrid proteins were 
expressed from both fusions and the one from pMTBEX1 was utilized to raise 
antibodies. These antibodies specifically recognize the RolB moiety in both 
pL-MS2-rolB and ptac-cI-rolB fusions. Unfused, complete RolB protein was 
obtained by in vitro translation in a rabbit reticulocyte system of a transcript 
obtained by in vitro transcription of rolB. RolB protein is specifically 
immunoprecipitated by the antibodies raised against the hybrid protein MS2-RolB.

Complete nucleotide sequence of the group I RNA bacteriophage fr.

(1)Department of Biochemistry, University of Leiden, The Netherlands.

We report the complete nucleotide sequence of the group I RNA bacteriophage fr. 
The entire genome consists of 3575 nucleotides, six nucleotides more than the 
only other sequenced group I representative, MS2. The greatest divergence 
between these phages occurs in the 5' terminal region of the A gene, while the 
lysis-replicase gene overlap, the coat gene and the central region of the 
replicase gene are highly conserved. Overall sequence homology between fr and 
MS2 is 77%. Here, we present a general comparison between the two phages. In the 
accompanying paper we use phylogenetic sequence comparison between MS2 and fr to 
deduce the secondary structure at the 3' untranslated region.

Secondary structure at the 3' terminal region of RNA coliphages: comparison with 
tRNA.

Adhin MR(1), Alblas J, van Duin J.

Author information:
(1)Department of Biochemistry, University of Leiden, The Netherlands.

Secondary structure models for the 3' non-coding region of the four groups of 
coliphage RNA are proposed based on comparative sequence analysis and on 
previously published data on the sensitivity of nucleotides in MS2 RNA to 
chemical modification and enzymes. We report the following observations. (1) In 
contrast to the coding regions, the structure at the 3' terminus is 
characterized by stable regular helices. We note the occurrence of the loop 
sequences 5'-GUUCGC and 5'-CGAAAG, that are reported to confer exceptional 
stability to stem structures. These features are probably present to promote the 
segregation of mother and daughter strands during replication. (2) Comparison of 
homologous helices indicates that only those base pair substitutions are allowed 
that maintain the thermodynamic stability. (3) We have compared the structure of 
phage RNA with tRNA. Overall similarity is low, but one common element may 
exist. It is a quasi-continuous helix of 12 basepairs that could be the 
equivalent of the 12 basepair long coaxially stacked helix, formed by the T psi 
C arm and the aminoacyl acceptor arm in tRNA. As in tRNA, this structure element 
starts after the fourth nucleotide from the 3' end. (4) Phage RNA contains a 
large variable region of about 35 nucleotides bulging out from the 
quasi-continuous helix. We speculate that the variable loop in present-day tRNA 
could be the remnant of the variable region found in phage RNA. The variable 
region contains overlapping binding sites for the replicase enzyme and the 
maturation protein. This common binding site may serve as a switch from 
replication to packaging.

Intracellular lytic enzyme systems and their use for disruption of Escherichia 
coli.

Dabora RL(1), Cooney CL.

Author information:
(1)Merck and Co., Inc., Elkton, VA 22827.

This article focusses on lytic enzyme systems available in E. coli and their 
potential use for cellular disruption. In the systems described here the genetic 
information for lysis would be carried within the microbial host, either 
integrated or naturally occurring on chromosomal DNA, or on extrachromosomal 
elements such as plasmids. Each microbe would carry complete information for 
endogenous enzymatic lysis, and lysis would occur in a controlled manner after 
being triggered by an external factor such as temperature or inducer addition. 
The lytic systems explored in this review include the autolytic enzymes, colicin 
lytic enzymes, and bacteriophage lytic enzymes from phage phiX174, T4, lambda, 
MS2 and Q beta. Many of the colicin lytic enzymes and all of the bacteriophage 
lytic enzymes described here have been cloned, and in some instances examined as 
cellular disruption methods. None of the E. coli autolytic enzymes have been 
cloned, but information pertinent for use as a disruption method is described.

Heterologous expression of a mutated toxin gene from Bacillus thuringiensis 
subsp. tenebrionis.

Author information:
(1)Max-Planck-Institut für medizinische Forschung, Abteilung Molekulare 
Biologie, Heidelberg, F.R.G.

Using oligonucleotide probes we have isolated a DNA fragment encoding an 
insecticidal toxin of the coleopteran specific Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. 
tenebrionis. The gene was altered by site directed mutagenesis at its 5'-end and 
adapted for general cloning and expression purposes with a linker including a 
start codon and new restriction sites. The constructs were inserted into several 
vector plasmids and expressed in Escherichia coli. Expression E. coli was 
strongly enhanced by the lac-promoter. A fusion protein with phage 
MS2-polymerase was produced together with a 67 kDa protein also found for normal 
expression of the toxin gene. Synthesis of the latter protein indicated a second 
ribosome binding site at the 5'-terminus of the toxin encoding sequence. 
Toxin-containing proteins were identified by Western blot analysis. The positive 
cell extracts from E. coli had insecticidal activity on larvae of the Colorado 
potato beetle. The cloned gene is not homologous to a gene previously cloned by 
us whose gene products were also toxic to coleopteran larvae.

The structure of the icosahedral bacteriophage MS2 has been determined to 3.3 A 
resolution by X-ray crystallography. The phase determination involved both 
molecular replacement at low resolution using a known structure and heavy-atom 
substitution. The coat protein has no structural similarity to that of any other

Secondary structure of the central region of bacteriophage MS2 RNA. Conservation 
and biological significance.

Skripkin EA(1), Adhin MR, de Smit MH, van Duin J.

Author information:

Netherlands.

The RNA of the Escherichia coli RNA phages is highly structured with 75% of the 
nucleotides estimated to take part in base-pairing. We have used enzymatic and 
chemical sensitivity of nucleotides, phylogenetic sequence comparison and the 
phenotypes of constructed mutants to develop a secondary structure model for the 
central region (900 nucleotides) of the group I phage MS2. The RNA folds into a 
number of, mostly irregular, helices and is further condensed by several 
long-distance interactions. There is substantial conservation of helices between 
the related groups I and II, attesting to the relevance of discrete RNA folding. 
In general, the secondary structure is thought to be needed to prevent annealing 
of plus and minus strand and to confer protection against RNase. Superimposed, 
however, are features required to regulate translation and replication. The MS2 
RNA section studied here contains three translational start sites, as well as 
the binding sites for the coat protein and the replicase enzyme. Considering the 
density of helices along the RNA, it is not unexpected to find that all these 
sites lie in helical regions. This fact, however, does not mean that these sites 
are recognized as secondary structure elements by their interaction partners. 
This holds true only for the coat protein binding site. The other four sites 
function in the unfolded state and the stability of the helix in which they are 
contained serves to negatively control their accessibility. Mutations that 
stabilize helices containing ribosomal binding sites reduce their efficiency and 
vice versa. Comparison of homologous helices in different phage RNAs indicates 
that base substitutions have occurred in such a way that the thermodynamic 
stability of the helix is maintained. The evolution of individual helices shows 
several distinct size-reduction patterns. We have observed codon deletions from 
loop areas and shortening of hairpins by base-pair deletions from either the 
bottom, the middle or the top of stem structures. Evidence for the coaxial 
stacking of some helical segments is discussed.

Surface proteins of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae identified from an Escherichia coli 
expression plasmid library.

Klinkert MQ, Herrmann R, Schaller H.

A genomic library of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae was constructed by cloning random 
DNA fragments approximately 300 base pairs long in a fusion expression plasmid, 
pEx29, containing the N terminus of the phage MS2 polymerase under the control 
of the PL promoter of phage lambda. Clones that produced fusion proteins 
carrying surface-specific antigenic determinants were identified by using 
antiserum raised in a pig by intranasal inoculation of viable mycoplasmas. 
Rabbit antisera produced against gel-purified fusion proteins synthesized in 
Escherichia coli were analyzed by Western blotting to identify antigenically 
related mycoplasma components. Distinct mycoplasma proteins termed P90, P68, 
P50, P30, and P26 were identified. Evidence for the surface location of P90, 
P68, and P50 was provided by their sensitivity to trypsin and their comigration 
with lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodinated proteins of intact mycoplasmas. Immune 
electron microscopy, performed with antiserum against the hybrid MS2-mycoplasma 
protein produced in E. coli and corresponding to P90, also showed that its 
antigenic determinant is associated with the mycoplasma surface.

[Principles of selective inactivation of the virus genome. IV. The effect of 
UV-irradiation of phage MS2 on its binding with anti-MS2-immunoglobulins].

[Article in Russian]

Budovskiĭ EI, Kostiuk GV.

Ultraviolet (254 nm) irradiation of the bacteriophage MS2 results in the 
decrease of the number of antigenic determinants exposed on the virion surface. 
The cross-section of the decrease, as measured by the number of anti-MS2 IgG 
molecules bound per virion, is 10(-16) mm2 per photon. The decrease of the 
phage-antibody binding proceeds after irradiation with a rate constant of about 
5 x 10(-3) min-1. Since the antigenic determinants of the phage MS2 coat protein 
does not contain photoreactive amino acid residues, the irradiation-induced 
decrease of the phage antibody binding is determined, most probably, by the 
shielding of the antigenic determinants. Such shielding could be caused by 
rearrangement of coat protein molecules and/or of the capsid induced by 
photomodification of non-antigenic fragments of coat protein and/or of 
intraphage RNA.

Effects of GUG and AUG initiation codons on the expression of lacZ in 
Escherichia coli.

Looman AC, van Knippenberg PH.

We have replaced the ribosomal binding site (RBS) of the lacZ gene of E. coli by 
those of the maturation (A) gene of phage MS2 and that of the tufA gene. Both 
RBSs contain a GUG initiation codon. The expression with the tufA RBS is at 
least 25-fold higher than with the phage RBS. Changing the GUG into AUG results 
in a 3-fold increase in expression in both cases. In general, higher expression 
is accompanied by an increase of lac-specific mRNA. It is argued that this is a 
consequence of the more efficient translation of the mRNA.

Serological properties and processing in Escherichia coli K12 of OmpV fusion 
proteins of Vibrio cholerae.

Pohlner J, Meyer TF, Manning PA.

Fusion proteins comprising the amino-terminal 99 amino acids of the 
bacteriophage MS2 replicase and various portions of OmpV a major outer membrane 
protein of Vibrio cholerae were expressed in Escherichia coli K12. These fusions 
were expressed under the control of the PL promoter of bacteriophage lambda, and 
expression was controlled using a cIts repressor. Fusions occurring within the 
secretory signal sequence of OmpV gave rise to the production of mature OmpV. 
The efficiency, however, decreased with progressive deletion of the signal 
sequence within the fusions. The reactivity of various OmpV fusions with 
antisera raised against purified OmpV and whole bacteria demonstrated the 
existence of two antigenic domains: one present in the denatured form and 
another in the membrane-associated form of OmpV. These domains correspond to 
markedly hydrophilic regions of the protein as would be predicted for 
surface-exposed epitopes.

Accessibility to nucleases S1 and SV specific to secondary structure and thermal

[Article in Russian]

Grechko VV, Borisova OF, Sakharova NK, Timokhina GI, Kuznetsova NV.

The hydrolysis of E. coli 16S rRNA by nucleases specific to the secondary 
structure elements (S1 and SV), the melting of the RNA after partial hydrolysis 
by nuclease S1 and the electrophoretic mobility of hydrolysis products after 
denaturation-renaturation of RNA were studied. It was shown that the sensitivity 
of 16S rRNA to nuclease S1 depends on Zn or Mg ions concentration. The melting 
curves after partial hydrolysis by nuclease S1 were characterized by a decrease 
of the hyperchromic effect (by approximately 15%) and by a increase of Tm (by 3 
degrees). After RNA denaturation followed by slow or fast renaturation the 
electrophoretic patterns of the hydrolysis products were not changed, as in the 
case of phage MS2 RNA. It was supposed, that the rRNA molecule has a stable 
"nucleus" (or "nuclei"), which is organized as an intramolecular association of 
parallelly oriented double-stranded fragments of this RNA. Previously, such a 
mode of the spatial organization was proposed by us for phage MS2 RNA.

[Decreased synthetic activity as a possible cause of the death of Escherichia 
coli bacteria during amino acid starvation].

[Article in Russian]

Rybkin AI, Ravin VK.

The work is concerned with studying the breakdown of proteins and RNA when a 
polyauxotrophic Escherichia coli strain is incubated in a salt solution without 
amino acids, phosphorus, nitrogen and glucose at 43 degrees C as well as the 
ability of starving bacterial cells to recommence protein and RNA synthesis 
(also in the course of phage T4 infection) and to reproduce bacteriophages T4, 
lambda and MS2. Within the first two hours of the incubation, 12% of proteins 
and 40% of RNA break down to acid-soluble fragments. Then protein degradation 
stops while RNA decomposition goes on, but at a lower rate. Within 4-6 h of 
starvation, the rate of protein and RNA synthesis drops down 4-5 times and the 
survival rate equals 40-60% when the cells are transferred onto a complete 
medium. The quantitative characteristics of phages T4, lambda and MS2 
reproduction fall down in prestarved cells. The authors speculate that E. coli 
cells die off in the course of starvation not because some unique structure is 
destroyed, but owing to the fact that the activity of enzymes and ribosomes 
gradually declines. As a result, the synthetic activity of the cell drops down 
abruptly and irreversibly because the enzymes are inactivated and RNA breaks 
down, which eventually causes cell death.

A number of reports have suggested that platelets from polycythemia vera 
patients contain reverse transcriptase activity that might be correlated with 
C-type retrovirus-like particles. As described herein, we devised a new assay 
method for reverse transcriptase activity using MS-2 phage RNA hybridized with 
synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide (18-mer) as a template/primer. Using this new, 
sensitive assay method, we examined the platelet enzyme. By the conventional 
assay method using poly(rA)-oligo(dT), extracts of platelets showed a 
considerable amount of incorporation. However, by the new assay method using 
MS-2 RNA, no incorporation was observed. The poly(rA)-oligo(dT)-dependent 
activity was purified on Mono Q column, and it was shown that this activity 
coincided with that of DNA polymerase gamma.

Translational repression by bacteriophage MS2 coat protein does not require 
cysteine residues.

Peabody DS(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Cell Biology, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, 
Albuquerque 87131.

Previous studies implicated cysteine residues in the translational repressor 
(i.e. RNA binding) activity of the coat protein of bacteriophage MS2. It has 
been proposed that a protein sulfhydryl forms a transient covalent bond with an 
essential pyrimidine in the translational operator by a Michael addition 
reaction. We have utilized codon-directed mutagenesis methods to determine the 
importance of each of the two coat protein cysteines for repressor function in 
vivo. The results indicate that cys46 can be replaced by a variety of amino 
acids without loss of repressor function. Cys101, on the other hand, is more 
sensitive to substitution. Most position 101 substitutions inactivate the 
repressor, but one (arginine) results in normal repressor activity. Although the 
possibility of a transient covalent contact between cys101 and RNA is not 
categorically ruled out, construction of double mutants demonstrates that 
cysteines are not absolutely required for translational repression by coat 
protein.

Effect of spermidine on the conformation of bacteriophage MS2 RNA. Electron 
microscopy and computer modeling.

Jacobson AB, Kumar H, Zuker M.

The structure of single-stranded RNA from the bacteriophage MS2 has been 
examined by electron microscopy in the presence of the polyamine spermidine. The 
molecules are found in two alternate conformations. The first of these can be 
characterized as a cruciform structure composed of three large loops 
approximately 500 to 700 nucleotides in size. The interior of the molecule has 
extensive base-paired regions which connect distant regions of the molecule; the 
farthest being 2500 nucleotides apart. In the second conformation, the molecules 
appear rod-like. Two of the large loops disappear, and these regions form, 
instead, extensive long-range helices. Computer modeling has been employed to 
explore the base-pairing potential of the sequence of bacteriophage MS2 RNA. 
Double-stranded regions identified by electron microscopy are shown to occur in 
local G + C-rich stretches of the RNA. Detailed models have been calculated for 
two regions of long-range contact. One of these includes the ribosome-binding 
site for the viral coat protein gene. The results are discussed in the context 
of the known role of RNA structure in the regulation of viral gene expression.

Regulation of gene expression at the translational level. The rescue factor 
reverses thermosensitive protein synthesis in N4316, a conditionally-lethal 
mutant of Escherichia coli defective in translation.

Author information:
(1)Banting and Best Department of Medical Research, C.H. Best Institute, 
Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Extracts of the conditionally-lethal mutant Escherichia coli N4316 are defective 
in a newly described translation factor, the rescue protein. We have analyzed 
the in vitro translation products of this mutant by gel electrophoresis during 
normal and arrested synthesis at the permissive and non-permissive temperatures. 
Translation programmed with MS2 bacteriophage RNA at the non-permissive 
temperature results in highly reduced synthesis of the coat protein with no 
detectable levels of the maturation and replicase products. Thus the relative 
number of copies of proteins synthesized by the ribosomes is altered in this 
mutant. In addition, there is mistranslation of the coat gene which results in 
the overproduction of the phage encoded no. 7 protein. Aberrant synthesis is 
also reflected in the increased read-through of termination codons during 
synthesis directed by phage RNAs harbouring amber mutations in the coat cistron. 
The rescue protein, purified from the parental strain, is able to complement the 
thermosensitive defect and restore proper synthesis. Biochemical 
characterization of the defect in the absence of rescue shows no detectable 
deficiency in the extent of initiation complex formation in reactions inhibited 
with sparsomycin. Peptidyltransferase is fully active as judged by the kinetics 
of formylmethionine-puromycin formation. However, rescue does exert an effect at 
the level of termination. In addition, the thermolability of the mutant can be 
reversed by dissociating 70S ribosomes into 30S and 50S subunits. Based on these 
and other observations, we propose tht rescue mediates a novel function in the 
association/dissociation of ribosomal subunits which is essential to the 
accuracy and efficiency of translation.

in murein synthesis.

The mode of action of the phage MS2 lysis protein seems not to involve a direct 
interaction with the murein synthesis machinery as is the case for lysis induced 
by beta-lactam antibiotics. Mutants with defects in various penicillin-binding 
proteins, which are involved in murein synthesis, were found to show normal 
lysis sensitivity towards the cloned MS2 lysis protein. In addition, both 
processes, longitudinal growth of the murein sacculus in the presence of 
furazlocillin, cephalexin and nalidixic acid as well as spherical growth in the 
presence of mecillinam were sensitive to the phage lysis protein. No change in 
the capacity of the binding proteins to bind 14C-labelled penicillin G was 
observed in the presence of the MS2 lysis gene product.

Specific localization of the lysis protein of bacteriophage MS2 in membrane 
adhesion sites of Escherichia coli.

Federal Republic of Germany.

Specific localization of the lysis (L) protein of bacteriophage MS2 in the cell 
wall of Escherichia coli was determined by immunoelectron microscopy. After 
induction of the cloned lysis gene, the cells were plasmolyzed, fixed, and 
embedded in either Epon or Lowicryl K4M. Polyclonal L-protein-specific antiserum 
was purified by preabsorption to membranes from cells harboring a control 
plasmid. Protein A-gold was used to label the protein-antibody complexes. 
Between 42.8% (Lowicryl) and 33.8% (Epon) of the label was found in inner and 
outer membranes, but 30.3% (Lowicryl) and 32.8% (Epon) was present mostly in 
clusters in the adhesion sites visible after plasmolysis. The remaining label 
(26.9 and 33.4%, respectively) appeared to be present in the periplasmic space 
but may also have been part of membrane junctions not visible because of poor 
contrast of the specimen. In contrast, a quite different distribution of the L 
protein was found in cells grown under conditions of penicillin tolerance, i.e., 
at pH 5, a condition that had previously been shown to protect cells from 
L-protein-induced lysis. At tolerant conditions, only 21.0% of the L protein was 
in the adhesion sites; most of the protein (68.2%) was found in inner and outer 
membranes. It is concluded that lysis of the host, E. coli, was a result of the 
formation of specific L-protein-mediated membrane adhesion sites.

Codon discrimination and anticodon structural context.

Site-directed mutagenesis has been used to change the nucleotide C in the wobble 
position of tRNA(1Gly) (CCC) to U. The mutated tRNA was tested for its ability 
to read glycine codons in an in vitro protein-synthesizing system programmed 
with the phage message MS2-RNA that had been modified by site-directed 
mutagenesis so as to make it possible to monitor conveniently the reading of all 
four glycine codons. The results showed that while the efficiency of tRNA(1Gly) 
(UCC) was comparable to that of mycoplasma tRNA(Gly) (UCC) in the reading of the 
codon GGA, the mycoplasma tRNA(Gly) was far more efficient than the tRNA(1Gly) 
(UCC) in the reading of the codons GGU and GGC. Thus, the anticodon UCC, when 
present in the structural context of the tRNA(1Gly) molecule, behaved as 
predicted by the wobble rules while in the structural context of the mycoplasma 
tRNA(Gly) it read without discrimination between the nucleotides in the third 
codon position, in violation of the wobble restrictions. The result with the 
codon GGG showed that the anticodon UCC, when present in tRNA(1Gly), was 
considerably less efficient in reading this codon than it was in the structural 
context of the mycoplasma tRNA(Gly). It would therefore seem that the anticodon 
UCC, when present in a certain tRNA, can be an efficient wobbler, while in the 
molecular environment of another tRNA it is markedly restricted in its ability 
to wobble.

Disinfection of model indicator organisms in a drinking water pilot plant by 
using PEROXONE.

PEROXONE is an advanced oxidation process generated by combining ozone and 
hydrogen peroxide. This process stimulates the production of hydroxyl radicals, 
which have been shown to be superior to ozone for the destruction of some 
organic contaminants. In this study, pilot-scale experiments were conducted to 
evaluate the microbicidal effectiveness of PEROXONE and ozone against three 
model indicator groups. Escherichia coli and MS2 coliphage were seeded into the 
influent to the preozonation contactors of a pilot plant simulating conventional 
water treatment and were exposed to four ozone dosages (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 
mg/liter), four hydrogen peroxide/ozone (H2O2/O3) weight ratios (0, 0.3, 0.5, 
and 0.8), and four contact times (4, 5, 12, and 16 min) in two source 
waters--Colorado River water and state project water--of different quality. The 
removal of heterotrophic plate count bacteria was also monitored. Results of the 
study indicated that the microbicidal activity of PEROXONE was greatly affected 
by the applied ozone dose, H2O2/O3 ratio, contact time, source water quality, 
and type of microorganism tested. At contact times of 5 min or less, ozone alone 
was a more potent bactericide than PEROXONE at all H2O2/O3 ratios tested. 
However, this decrease in the bactericidal potency of PEROXONE was dramatic only 
as the H2O2/O3 ratio was increased from 0.5 to 0.8. The fact that the 
bactericidal activity of PEROXONE generally decreased with increasing H2O2/O3 
ratios was thought to be related to the lower ozone residuals produced. The 
viricidal activity of PEROXONE and ozone was comparable at all of the H2O2/O3 
ratios. Heterotrophic plate count bacteria were the most resistant group of 
organisms. Greater inactivation of E. coli and MS2 was observed in Colorado 
River water than in state project water and appeared to result from differences 
in the turbidity and alkalinity of the two waters. Regardless of source water, 
greater than 4.5 log10 of E. coli and MS2 was inactivated at an applied ozone 
dosage of 2.0 mg/liter (and a 4-min contact time) when the H2O2/O3 ratio was 
less than or equal to 0.5. Comparative disinfection experiments indicated that 
free chlorine was the most potent bactericidal agent, followed (in descending 
order of effectiveness) by ozone, PEROXONE, and chloramines. These results 
indicate that the PEROXONE process must be optimized for each source water to 
achieve microbicidal effectiveness.

Initiation complex formation on Euglena chloroplast 30S subunits in the presence 
of natural mRNAs.

Wang CC(1), Roney WB, Alston RL, Spremulli LL.

An in vitro system has been developed that allows the formation of translation 
initiation complexes with Euglena chloroplast 30S ribosomal subunits and natural 
mRNAs. For these experiments two regions of the Euglena chloroplast genome have 
been cloned behind the T7 transcriptional promoter and the corresponding RNAs 
synthesized in vitro. These mRNAs are capable of forming initiation complexes 
with chloroplast 30S subunits in the presence of fMet-tRNA and E. coli 
initiation factors. Deletion of the normal translation start site results in a 
message that is no longer recognized by the chloroplast subunits suggesting that 
the correct AUG initiation codon on the mRNA is being selected by the small 
ribosomal subunit. Initiation complex formation with the chloroplast 30S 
subunits is specific for chloroplast mRNAs and mRNA from the phage MS2 is not 
active in this system.

Nucleotide sequence from the ssRNA bacteriophage JP34 resolves the discrepancy 
between serological and biophysical classification.

Adhin MR(1), Hirashima A, van Duin J.

Author information:
(1)Department of Biochemistry, Leiden University, The Netherlands.

The nucleotide sequence of the coat and lysis genes of the single-stranded RNA 
bacteriophage JP34 is presented. Serological inactivation studies classified 
this phage as an intermediate between groups I and II. We show that the 
nucleotide similarity with group I is less than 45% but more than 95% for group 
II, classifying JP34 as a member of group II. The altered serotype of JP34 is 
most likely due to the change of three critical amino acids of the coat protein 
to residues present in group I phage MS2 at the homologous positions. 
Serological characterization of RNA bacteriophages is thus not unambiguous. 
Phylogenetic sequence comparison between JP34, GA, and MS2 confirms the 
existence of a conserved helix in the coat gene of group I and group II phages. 
We also show that the JP34 coat and lysis genes can be expressed in cDNA clones 
and that the translation of the lysis gene is coupled to coat gene translation 
analogous to the regulation found in the group I phages.

Genetic and physical characterization of trimethoprim resistance plasmids from 
Shigella sonnei and Shigella flexneri.

Author information:
(1)Department of Bacteriology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ont., 
Canada.

Analysis of six Shigella flexneri and four S. sonnei isolates with trimethoprim 
(Tp) resistance from clinical cases in Ontario has shown that, in all isolates, 
the Tp resistance is mediated by gene(s) on conjugative, multiple 
antibiotic-resistance plasmids. The physical and genetic characterization of 
these plasmids revealed that there are three different Tp resistance plasmids. 
One group, composed of all six S. flexneri plasmids, consists of plasmids which 
are about 70 megadaltons (MDa) and inhibit the fertility of an Escherichia coli 
Hfr strain (Fi+). A representative member of this group, pPT4, demonstrates a 
weak incompatibility reaction with IncFl plasmid R455-2. Another group, three of 
the four S. sonnei plasmids, contains plasmids which are about 43 MDa, Fi-, and 
mediate propagation of phage PRD1. The third group, the remaining S. sonnei 
plasmid, is 53 MDa, fi+, mediates propagation of phages fd and MS2, and is 
incompatible with IncFII plasmid R100. These plasmids also have been 
differentiated by restriction endonuclease fragment profiles. Analysis of pPT4 
has revealed that the Tp resistance of this plasmid is transposable. The 
transposon, Tn536, is different from previously described Tp resistance 
transposons; it is 16 MDa, and in addition to Tp, it encodes resistance to 
mercuric chloride ions, spectinomycin, streptomycin, and sulfonamides.

Molecular evolution of bacteriophages: evidence of selection against the 
recognition sites of host restriction enzymes.

Sharp PM(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Genetics, Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland.

Restriction enzymes produced by bacteria serve as a defense against invading 
bacteriophages, and so phages without other protection would be expected to 
undergo selection to eliminate recognition sites for these enzymes from their 
genomes. The observed frequencies of all restriction sites in the genomes of all 
completely sequenced DNA phages (T7, lambda, phi X174, G4, M13, f1, fd, and IKe) 
have been compared to expected frequencies derived from trinucleotide 
frequencies. Attention was focused on 6-base palindromes since they comprise the 
typical recognition sites for type II restriction enzymes. All of these 
coliphages, with the exception of lambda and G4, exhibit significant avoidance 
of the particular sequences that are enterobacterial restriction sites. As 
expected, the sequenced fraction of the genome of phi 29, a Bacillus subtilis 
phage, lacks Bacillus restriction sites. By contrast, the RNA phage MS2, several 
viruses that infect eukaryotes (EBV, adenovirus, papilloma, and SV40), and three 
mitochondrial genomes (human, mouse, and cow) were found not to lack restriction 
sites. Because the particular palindromes avoided correspond closely with the 
recognition sites for host enzymes and because other viruses and small genomes 
do not show this avoidance, it is concluded that the effect indeed results from 
natural selection.

A synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 25 residues of phage MS2 
coded lysis protein dissipates the protonmotive force in Escherichia coli 
membrane vesicles by generating hydrophilic pores.

The RNA phage MS2 encodes a protein, 75 amino acids long, that is necessary and 
sufficient for lysis of the host cell. DNA deletion analysis has shown that the 
lytic activity is confined to the C-terminal half of the protein. We have 
examined the effects of a synthetic peptide, covering the C-terminal 25 amino 
acids of the lysis protein, on the electrochemical potential, generated in 
Escherichia coli membrane vesicles and in liposomes reconstituted with 
cytochrome c oxidase. In all cases the peptide dissipates the electrochemical 
potential. The peptide also induces the release of carboxyfluorescein (376 
daltons), but not of inuline (5500 daltons), from protein-free liposomes. The 
phenomena are observed at a lipid to peptide molar ratio of approximately 100:1. 
The possible connection between the dissipation of the proton-motive force and 
bacteriolysis is discussed.

Novel approach for modifying microporous filters for virus concentration from 
water.

Gainesville 32611.

Electronegative microporous filters composed of epoxyfiberglass (Filterite) were 
treated with cationic polymers to enhance their virus-adsorbing properties. This 
novel and inexpensive approach to microporous filter modification entails 
soaking filters in an aqueous solution of a cationic polymer such as 
polyethyleneimine (PEI) for 2 h at room temperature and then allowing the 
filters to air dry overnight on absorbent paper towels. PEI-treated filters were 
evaluated for coliphage (MS2, T2, and phi X174) and enterovirus (poliovirus type 
1 and coxsackievirus type B5) adsorption from buffer at pH 3.5 to 9.0 and for 
indigenous coliphages from unchlorinated secondary effluent at ambient pH. 
Adsorbed viruses were recovered with 3% beef extract (pH 9). Several other 
cationic polymers were used to modify epoxyfiberglass filters and were evaluated 
for their ability to concentrate viruses from water. Zeta potentials of 
disrupted filter material indicated that electronegative epoxyfiberglass filters 
were made more electropositive when treated with cationic polymers. In general, 
epoxyfiberglass filters treated with cationic polymers were found to adsorb a 
greater percentage of coliphages and enteroviruses than were untreated filters.

Amino acid and nucleotide sequence homologies among E. coli RNA polymerase core 
enzyme subunits, DNA primase, elongation factor Tu, F1-ATPase alpha, ribosomal 
protein L3, DNA polymerase I, T7 phage DNA polymerase, and MS2 phage RNA 
replicase beta subunit.

Ohnishi K.

The 330 residue-long N-terminal domains (NTDs) of beta and beta' subunits of the 
Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (RPase) core enzyme were found to be 
significantly homologous to the entire length of its alpha subunit. The 
C-terminal domains (CTDs) of the RPase beta subunit and DNA primase (dnaG 
protein) were not only strongly homologous to each other but also considerably 
homologous to the RPase alpha, suggesting that an alpha subunit-like enzyme must 
have been commonly ancestral to core enzyme subunits and primase. The N-terminal 
region (NTR) of RPase alpha was also found to show significant homologies with 
NTRs of the E. coli EF-Tu and F1-ATPase alpha subunit, and a possible weak 
homology with ribosomal protein L3. A most important finding was that the 
C-terminal regions (CTRs) of DNA polymerase (DPase) I, T7 phage DPase and MS2 
phage RNA replicase beta subunit are closely homologous with one another. These 
CTRs showed considerable homologies to RPase alpha NTD and RPase beta CTD. These 
conclusions are based on statistical evaluations of homologies in base and/or 
amino acid sequence alignments.

Codon usage and secondary structure of MS2 phage RNA.

Bulmer M(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Statistics, Oxford, UK.

MS2 is an RNA bacteriophage (3569 bases). The secondary structure of the RNA has 
been determined, and is known to play an important role in regulating 
translation. Paired regions of the genome have a higher G+C content than 
unpaired regions. It has been suggested that this reflects selection for high 
G+C content to encourage pairing, but a re-analysis of the data together with 
computer simulation suggest that it is an automatic consequence in any RNA 
sequence of the way it folds up to minimise its free energy. It has also been 
suggested that the three registers in which pairing can occur in a coding region 
are used differentially to optimise the use of the redundancy of the genetic 
code, but re-analysis of the data shows only weak statistical support for this 
hypothesis.

The mom gene of bacteriophage mu: a unique regulatory scheme to control a lethal 
function.

Kahmann R, Seiler A, Wulczyn FG, Pfaff E.

The mom gene of bacteriophage Mu encodes a DNA modification function which 
converts adenine to acetamido adenine in a sequence-specific manner. The mom 
gene itself is subject to a complex regulation: gene expression requires 
methylation by the Escherichia coli Dam methylase of specific sites upstream of 
the mom promoter and transactivation of the promoter by a Mu gene product. The 
requirement for transactivation can be overcome when mom is transcribed from 
foreign promoters. When cloned into various sites in pBR322, the mom gene is 
always found in an orientation where transcription from vector promoters is 
excluded. The productive orientation is lethal to the cell. This effect is 
mediated by the concerted action of the mom gene product and the product of gene 
com (control of mom, previously termed ORF-x) whose coding region overlaps the 
5-coding region of the mom gene. When mom is expressed from its own promoter, 
internal deletions in com completely abolish expression of the mom gene. 
Fragments lacking the 5' end of com can be cloned downstream of constitutive 
plasmid promoters. The com gene product itself is not lethal to the cell. The 
region encoding mom has been cloned in pL expression vectors. The mom gene 
product, a peptide of 27 kDal, has been visualized on gels. Efficient expression 
of Mom from pL requires gene com. A fusion between MS-2 polymerase and com has 
been generated. The fusion product is made in large amounts, whereas the mom 
gene product is not overproduced although the gene is present on the same 
transcriptional unit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Adsorption of viruses to charge-modified silica.

Zerda KS, Gerba CP, Hou KC, Goyal SM.

The purpose of this study was to provide a clearer understanding of virus 
adsorption, focusing specifically on the role of electrostatic interactions 
between virus particles and adsorbent surfaces. The adsorption of poliovirus 1, 
reovirus types 1 and 3, and coliphages MS-2 and T2 to colloidal silica 
synthetically modified to carry either positive or negative surface charge was 
evaluated. Adsorption experiments were performed by combining virus and silica 
in 0.1-ionic-strength buffers of pH 4.0, 6.4, and 8.5. Samples agitated for 
specified adsorption periods were centrifuged to pellet adsorbent particles plus 
adsorbed virus, and the supernatants were assayed for unadsorbed virus. All 
viruses adsorbed exclusively to negatively charged silica at pH values below 
their isoelectric points, i.e., under conditions favoring a positive surface 
charge on the virions. Conversely, all viruses adsorbed exclusively to 
positively charged silica at pH values above their isoelectric points, i.e., 
where virus surface charge is negative. Viruses in near-isoelectric state 
adsorbed to all types of silica, albeit to a lesser degree.

The accessibility of phage MS2 RNA to structure specific nucleases in various 
conditions.

SK.

The accessibility of ds- and ss-segments of phage MS2 RNA to ds- and ss-specific 
nucleases (RNase III, nuclease SV and nuclease S1) was studied. The results show 
that the RNA has hydrolysis sites for all the nucleases used. These sites are 
unvariable in a wide range of the conditions (ionic strength, pH, bivalent 
cations and temperature) and are not changed also after 
denaturation-renaturation of the RNA. This testifies that the distribution and 
interactions of ds- and ss-segments in the whole molecule are very specific and 
stable.

Analysis of modification-dependent structural alterations in the anticodon loop 
of Escherichia coli tRNAArg and their effects on the translation of MS2 RNA.

Baumann U, Fischer W, Sprinzl M.

The conformation of the anticodon loop of Escherichia coli tRNAArg was 
investigated. It is shown that the structure of the anticodon loop is influenced 
by the base composition of the anticodon stem, and the natural modification of 
the nucleoside residue 32 in the anticodon loop. The structural effects detected 
by analysis of the accessibility of the anticodon loop to nuclease S1 could be 
correlated with the ability of different Arg-tRNAArg species to suppress 
frame-shifting during translation of MS2 RNA.

Concentration of viruses from water by using cellulose filters modified by in

Untreated cellulose filters adsorbed only small amounts of poliovirus 1, 
echovirus 5, coxsackievirus B5, or bacteriophage MS2 that were added to tap 
water or to solutions of imidazole-glycine buffer at pH 5 to 7. Modification of 
filters by in situ flocculation of ferric and aluminum hydroxides greatly 
increased the ability of the filters to adsorb viruses. Viruses adsorbed to the 
modified filters could be recovered by treating the filters with 3% beef extract 
(pH 9.5). Greater than 60% of the enteroviruses and greater than 55% of the MS2 
added to tap water or buffer could be recovered in the beef extract eluate.

[Characteristics of the het mutations in the Escherichia coli chromosome causing

[Article in Russian]

Ismailov ZF, Smirnov SP, Tarasov VA.

Four mutations were studied which lead to increasing the frequency of transposon 
Tn1 translocation into different replicons. These mutations (het1, het2, het3 
and het4) increase the frequency of Tn1 translocation 10-20-fold. The het1 
mutation is recessive and has been localized in the 90-94.5 min region of the 
bacterial chromosome. The mutation effects Tn1 transposition in the presence of 
F plasmid only. As we have demonstrated recently, F-plasmid inhibits Tn1 
transposition in Escherichia coli cells. The het1 mutation eliminates this 
inhibition. Unlike het2, het3 and het4 mutations, het1 is responsible for 
resistance to male phages f1, f2, MS2 and inhibition of conjugative transfer in 
F+ bacteria.

Mistranslation during phenylalanine starvation.

Parker J, Precup J.

Starvation for phenylalanine led to leucine misincorporation frequencies of 0.1 
and 0.6 at UUC codons in the argI transcript of Escherichia coli, but no 
detectable misincorporation at a UUU codon. Under similar starvation conditions 
the relative synthesis of full sized MS2 coat protein, encoded by the RNA virus 
or a DNA copy, is greatly reduced, preventing analysis of the protein. This 
reduction in amount is unaffected by a rpsL mutation.

Synthesis in Escherichia coli and immunological characterization of a 
polypeptide containing the cleavage sites associated with trypsin enhancement of 
rotavirus SA11 infectivity.

Arias CF, Lizano M, López S.

About 45% of the rotavirus SA11 VP3 gene was inserted into a thermoinducible 
expression plasmid under the control of phage lambda PL promoter. The primary 
translation product predicted on the basis of the plasmid construction was a 
hybrid protein in which the 98 amino-terminal amino acids of phage MS2 
polymerase were followed by amino acids 42 to 387 of the VP3 protein, which 
included the region containing the cleavage sites associated with trypsin 
enhancement of infectivity. On induction, a polypeptide that had the expected 
mol. wt. and contained VP3-related amino acid sequences as judged by 
immunological criteria, was synthesized to a level representing about 15% of the 
total bacterial protein. When a bacterial lysate enriched for the fusion 
polypeptide was injected into mice, it induced antibodies which inhibited 
haemagglutination and neutralized SA11 rotavirus infectivity.

Fate of viruses in artificial wetlands.

Gersberg RM, Lyon SR, Brenner R, Elkins BV.

Little is known about the ability of wetlands to remove disease-causing viruses 
from municipal wastewater. In this study we examined the survival of several 
indicators of viral pollution (indigenous F-specific bacteriophages, seeded MS2 
bacteriophage, and seeded human poliovirus type 1) applied in primary municipal 
wastewater to artificial wetland ecosystems. Only about 1% of the indigenous 
F-specific RNA bacteriophages survived flow through the vegetated wetland beds 
at a 5-cm-day-1 hydraulic application rate during the period from June through 
December 1985. The total number of indigenous F-specific bacteriophages 
(F-specific RNA and F-specific DNA phages) was also reduced by about 99% by 
wetland treatment, with the mean inflow concentration over the period of an 
entire year reduced from 3,129 to 33 PFU ml-1 in the outflow of a vegetated bed 
and to 174 PFU ml-1 in the outflow of an unvegetated bed. Such superior 
treatment by the vegetated bed demonstrates the significant role of higher 
aquatic plants in the removal process. Seeded MS2 bacteriophage and seeded 
poliovirus were removed more efficiently than were the indigenous 
bacteriophages, with less than 0.2% of MS2 and 0.1% of the poliovirus surviving 
flow at the same hydraulic application rate. The decay rate (k) of MS2 in a 
stagnant wetlands (k = 0.012 to 0.028 h-1) was lower than that for flowing 
systems (k = 0.44 to 0.052 h-1), reflecting the enhanced capacity for filtration 
or adsorption of viruses by the root-substrate complex (and associated 
biofilm).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Selection of the mRNA translation initiation region by Escherichia coli 
ribosomes.

Two genes specifying model mRNAs of minimal size and coding capacity, with or 
without the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence, were assembled, cloned, and 
transcribed in high yields. These mRNAs, as well as synthetic polynucleotides, 
phage MS2 RNA, and a deoxyoctanucleotide complementary to the 3' end of 16S rRNA 
were used to study the mechanism of translation initiation in vitro. Escherichia 
coli 30S ribosomal subunits interact with all these nucleic acids, albeit with 
different affinities; the affinity for the mRNA with the SD sequence (Ka 
approximately 2 x 10(7) M-1) is more than an order of magnitude higher than that 
for the mRNA lacking this sequence. The initiation factors are equally required, 
regardless of the presence of the SD sequence, for 30S and 70S initiation 
complex formation and for mRNA translation, but the initiation factors do not 
affect the SD interaction or the binding of the mRNAs to the ribosomes. The SD 
interaction is also mechanistically irrelevant for 30S initiation complex 
formation and is not essential for translation in vitro or for the selection of 
the mRNA reading frame. It is suggested that the function of the SD interaction 
is to ensure a high concentration of the initiation triplet near the ribosomal 
peptidyl-tRNA binding site, whereas the selection of the translational start is 
achieved kinetically, under the influence of the initiation factors, during 
decoding of the initiator tRNA.

Induction of the autolytic system of Escherichia coli by specific insertion of

Bacterial lysis induced by the expression of the cloned lysis gene of the RNA 
bacteriophage MS2 in Escherichia coli was shown to be under the same regulatory 
control mechanisms as penicillin-induced lysis. It was controlled by the 
stringent response and showed the phenomenon of tolerance when E. coli was grown 
at pH 5. Changes in the fine structure of the murein were found to be the 
earliest physiological changes in the cell, taking place 10 min before the onset 
of cellular lysis and inhibition of murein synthesis. Both the average length of 
the glycan strands and, with a time lag, the degree of cross-linkage were 
altered, indicating that a lytic transglycosylase and a DD-endopeptidase had 
been triggered. After extensive separation of the membranes by isopycnic sucrose 
gradient centrifugation, the lysis protein was present predominantly in the 
cytoplasmic membrane and in a fraction of intermediate density and, to a lesser 
degree, in the outer membrane, irrespective of the conditions of growth. 
However, only under lysis-permissive conditions could a 17% increase in the 
number of adhesion sites between the inner and outer membranes be observed. 
Thus, a casual relationship between lysis and the formation of lysis 
protein-induced adhesion sites seems to exist.

A continuous cell-free translation system capable of producing polypeptides in 
high yield.

A cell-free translation system has been constructed that uses a continuous flow 
of the feeding buffer [including amino acids, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and 
guanosine triphosphate (GTP)] through the reaction mixture and a continuous 
removal of a polypeptide product. Both prokaryotic (Escherichia coli) and 
eukaryotic (wheat embryos, Triticum sp.) versions of the system have been 
tested. In both cases the system has proven active for long times, synthesizing 
polypeptides at a high constant rate for tens of hours. With the use of MS2 
phage RNA or brome mosaic virus RNA 4 as templates, 100 copies of viral coat 
proteins per RNA were synthesized for 20 hours in the prokaryotic or eukaryotic 
system, respectively. With synthetic calcitonin messenger RNA, 150 to 300 copies 
of calcitonin polypeptide were produced per messenger RNA in both types of 
continuous translation systems for 40 hours.

Alignment of the amino acid (aa) sequences of T7 phage DNA polymerase (DPase), 
E. coli DNA polymerase I (Pol I) and MS2 phage RNA replicase beta subunit (MS2 
Repl) were established by computer-aided methods. The results showed that the 
entire length (aa's 16-704) of T7 DPase is homologous to Pol I aa's 
207-928(C-term) with 21.5% aa identity, and that domains I (aa's-1-311) and II 
(312-451(C-term] were found to be homologous to each other and to N-terminal 
region of T7 DPase (aa's 1-250). Thus these enzymes and domains are homologous 
to one another and must have evolved from a co-ancestral enzyme.

Missense misreading of asparagine codons as a function of codon identity and 
context.

Precup J, Parker J.

During asparagine starvation the frequency of lysine for asparagine 
substitutions increases to levels that enable one to isolate and sequence 
mistranslated protein. We have used site-directed mutagenesis to construct a 
series of derivatives of the gene encoding the coat protein of the bacteriophage 
MS2. The mutant set constructed has either AAU or AAC as codon three in the gene 
with each possible adjoining 3' base. Lysine incorporation in coat protein 
encoded by these genes shows that AAU is misread from 4- to 9-fold more 
frequently than AAC with any 3' context. Although in some cases context effects 
of approximately 2-fold were noted, there seems to be no simple hypothesis to 
explain them.

Structural and immunochemical characterization of a ribosomal protein from 
gram-positive Micrococcus luteus which is functionally homologous to Escherichia 
coli ribosomal protein S1.

Muralikrishna P, Suryanarayana T.

Ribosomes from gram-positive Micrococcus luteus contain an acidic protein 
(ML-S1). ML-S1 has been purified by chromatography of ribosomes on a 
poly(U)-Sepharose column and the purified protein has a mobility in sodium 
dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide gels similar to that of ribosomal protein S1 of 
Escherichia coli (apparent Mr 72,000). Protein ML-S1 reacted with E. coli 
anti-S1 serum with an immunological partial-identity reaction. ML-S1 also 
reacted with antibodies raised against two structural domains of E. coli S1 (the 
N-terminal ribosome-binding domain and central and C-terminal 
nucleic-acid-binding domain). Weak reaction with antiserum to the 
nucleic-acid-binding domain of E. coli S1 was observed. ML-S1 was digested with 
trypsin under mild and exhaustive conditions. Mild digestion resulted in the 
production of a trypsin-resistant core (ML-S1F1) like E. coli S1. The fragment 
pattern obtained after exhaustive digestion differed appreciably from that 
obtained with E. coli S1. ML-S1 bound to poly(U) as strongly as E. coli S1 and 
also showed appreciable binding to denatured DNA. Addition of ML-S1 to 
S1-depleted ribosomes from E. coli and M. luteus markedly stimulated the 
poly(U)-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis. Phage MS2-RNA-dependent 
translation was also found to be stimulated by ML-S1 although to a much lesser 
extent than the stimulation by E. coli S1. At a molar excess of ML-S1 to 
ribosomes the protein showed a similar inhibitory effect to E. coli S1 on 
polypeptide synthesis. Our data indicate that ML-S1 retained the structural 
domains important for its function despite certain structural differences from 
E. coli S1.

Expression of diagnostic 31/32 kilodalton proteins of Schistosoma mansoni as 
fusions with bacteriophage MS2 polymerase.

An expression plasmid pEx34b was used to synthesise parts of the 31/32 kDa 
Schistosoma mansoni antigens as fusions with the amino terminus of the phage MS2 
polymerase. Purified MS2-schistosome fusion proteins reacted specifically in an 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with sera from S. mansoni-infected patients. 
The observation that the majority of human sera tested recognised 
schistosome-specific epitopes, but not the MS2 polymerase fragment, suggests 
that the fusion proteins are useful for the immunodiagnosis of schistosomiasis 
and might be incorporated in a serological test system based on recombinant 
antigens.

Codon contexts in enterobacterial and coliphage genes.

Gouy M(1).

Author information:
(1)Institut d'Evolution Moléculaire, Université Claude Bernard, Villeurbanne, 
France.

This investigation of the codon context of enterobacteria, plasmid, and phage 
protein genes was based on a search for correlations between the presence of one 
base type at codon position III and the presence of another base type at some 
other position in adjacent codons. Enterobacterial genes were compared with 
eukaryotic sequences for codon context effects. In enterobacterial genes, base 
usage at codon position III is correlated with the third position of the 
upstream adjacent codon and with all three positions of the downstream codon. 
Plasmid genes are free of context biases. Phage genes are heterogeneous: MS2 
codons have no biased context, whereas lambda genes partly follow the trends of 
the host bacterium, and T7 genes have biased codon contexts that differ from 
those of the host. It has been reported that two successive third-codon 
positions tend to be occupied by two purines or two pyrimidines in Escherichia 
coli genes of low expression level. Here, the extent to which highly expressed 
protein genes can modulate base usage at two successive codon positions III, 
given the constraints on codon usage and protein sequence that act on them, was 
quantified. This demonstrates that the above-mentioned favored patterns are not 
a characteristic of weakly expressed genes but occur in all genes in which codon 
context can vary appreciably. The correlation between successive third-codon 
positions is a distinct feature of enterobacteria and of some phages, one that 
may result from adaptation of gene structure to translational efficiency. 
Conversely, codon context in yeast and human genes is biased--but for reasons 
unrelated to translation.

The bovine oxytocin precursor was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion 
protein by cloning the hormone encoding cDNA in frame behind the replicase gene 
of the RNA phage MS2. By step-wise extraction with different urea 
concentrations, the fusion protein was enriched in the 7 M urea fraction and 
further purified by Sephacryl S-300 chromatography. The oxytocin precursor was 
cleaved off the fusion protein by cyanogen bromide treatment, chromatographed on 
FPLC columns and identified by Western blot analysis, using antibodies raised 
against neurophysin.

The monofunctional and bifunctional furocoumarin derivatives 
8-methyl-3-carbethoxypsoralen (8Me3CPs) and 8-methoxypsoralen (8MOP) as well as 
their thiosubstituted derivatives (2-thio-8Me3CPs and 2-thio-8MOP) were compared 
in terms of their reactivities towards a ribonucleoprotein, the bacteriophage 
MS2. The order of their photoreactivities differed from that measured with 
nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA. Besides their widely investigated 
photoreactivity, their biological activity in the dark and after pre-irradiation 
was quantified. A parameter was defined which compares the number of molecules 
acting in the dark for 1 h with the number of absorbed photons which lead to the 
same degree of inactivation. The parameter for the furocoumarin derivatives 
examined, including 3-carbethoxypsoralen (3CPs) and 
4'-aminomethyl-4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen (AMT), was in the following order: AMT 
greater than 3CPs greater than 8MOP greater than 8Me3CPs greater than 8Me3CPsS 
approximately 8MOPS. A similar parameter was also determined for the dark effect 
of pre-irradiated compounds.

Activation thermodynamics of virus adsorption to solids.

Gainesville 32611.

The kinetics of bacteriophage MS2, T2, and f2 adsorption to powdered 
nitrocellulose and disrupted Seitz S1 filters at pH 7 were determined as a 
function of temperature. Data from these studies were combined with data 
produced in a previous study on MS2 adsorption to clay by Stagg et al. (Appl. 
Environ. Microbiol. 33:385-391, 1977). These workers studied the adsorption of 
MS2 to bentonite clay as a function of temperature. Data from both this previous 
study and the current one were used to calculate the thermodynamic parameters of 
virus adsorption. The results show that adsorption of bacteriophages to the 
solids tested is a physical process (energy of activation, less than 40 kcal 
[168 J]/mol) rather than a chemical process (energy of activation, greater than 
40 kcal/mol). The free energy of activation showed a high negative correlation 
(r = -0.904, r2 = 0.817) with the percentage of virus adsorption to the solids 
tested. The energy of activation was highly negatively correlated with the 
percentage of virus adsorption to nitrocellulose and clay (r = -0.913, r2 = 
0.834) but poorly correlated with the percentage of virus adsorption to 
disrupted Seitz S1 filters (r = -0.348, r2 = 0.121). In general, under 
conditions in which the percentage of virus adsorption was low, the energy of 
activation, the free energy of activation, and the entropy of activation were 
high. Increasing the percentage of virus adsorbed by changing the adsorbing 
conditions or changing the adsorbing solid decreased the energy of activation, 
the free energy of activation, and the entropy of activation.

MS2 phage RNA-directed synthesis of an N-terminal polypeptide of the phage coat 
protein on Escherichia coli 70 S ribosomes was initiated in a cell-free system 
with the N-dinitrophenyl derivative of methionyl-tRNAFMet) and performed in the 
absence of tyrosine, lysine, cysteine and methionine. As a result, the 
translating ribosomes carried peptides up to 42 amino acid residues in length 
with the dinitrophenyl hapten at the N-ends. Using the immune electron 
microscopy technique the positions of the nascent peptide N-ends on the 70 S 
ribosomes have been visualized. It has been found that (i) the N-ends of nascent 
peptides of these lengths are accessible to antibodies, (ii) the exit site of a 
nascent peptide is the pocket between the base of the central protuberance and 
the L1 ridge on the 50 S subunit, i.e. presumably its peptidyl transferase 
center, and (iii) the further pathway of a nascent peptide seems to proceed 
along the groove on the external surface of the 50 S subunit.

Lysis induction of Escherichia coli by the cloned lysis protein of the phage MS2 
depends on the presence of osmoregulatory membrane-derived oligosaccharides.

Expression of the cloned lysis protein of phage MS2, which is sufficient to lyse 
wild type Escherichia coli, does not cause lysis of mutants lacking the 
osmoregulatory membrane-derived oligosaccharides (MDO). The lysis gene product 
normally found in the membrane fraction was not stably inserted into the 
membranes of a mdoA mutant; rather degradation and release from the membrane 
occurred. Gentle plasmolysis of the MDO-lacking mutant clearly showed an 
increased periplasmic space as compared to wild type cells. It is concluded that 
the MDOs play an important role in maintaining a proper arrangement of inner and 
outer membrane, a prerequisite for a functional insertion of the MS2 lysis 
protein.

[Comparison of the conformation of RNA from phage MS2 and 16S rRNA. Interaction 
with dyes specific for the secondary structure of native RNA and RNA subjected 
to hydrolysis by nuclease S1].

[Article in Russian]

Borisova OF, Grechko VV, Kuznetsova NV, Sakharova NK, Timokhina GI.

The interaction of ethidium bromide (EtBr) with double-stranded (ds), and 
acridine orange (AO) with single-stranded (ss) fragments of 16S rRNA Escherichia 
coli in a wide range of ionic strength, at various pH, Zn2+ ion concentrations 
and partial hydrolysis by nuclease S1 was investigated. It was shown that about 
90% of the RNA molecule is accessible to both dyes, when the ionic strength is 
near of 0.01 (pH 7). Approximately half of the RNA becomes inaccessible to dyes, 
when the ionic strength was increased up to 0.08-0.24 (pH 4.7-7), independent on 
the presence of Zn2+ ions (10(-3) M). About a half of the ds-, and a quarter of 
the ss-segments of the RNA, deduced from the secondary structure model were 
protected from the interaction with EtBr and AO. The hydrolysis of about a half 
of ss-segments upon addition of the Zn2+ (10(-3) M) ions did not affect the RNA 
tertiary structure. The experimental data obtained confirm the idea of the 
existence of some "nucleus" (or "nuclei") within the 16S rRNA molecule. The 
"nucleus" seems to be inaccessible to the dyes and is very stable to heat 
denaturation. It was supposed that this structure is organized by means of 
interaction of some of the parallelly oriented ds-segments, as it was suggested 
earlier for the phage MS2 RNA structure.

The host-lysis-inducing functions of phi X174 protein E and MS2 protein L were 
recently shown to reside on the N-terminal and C-terminal halves of the two 
respective lysis proteins. In the present study it is shown that the small lysis 
proteins encoded in various colicinogenic plasmids share local sequence 
similarities and certain structural characteristics with the essential peptides 
of their coliphage-coded counterparts. Despite their dissimilar sizes and 
origins, it is suggested that the colicinogenic lysis proteins are functionally 
analogous and evolutionarily related to those of icosahedral single-stranded DNA 
and RNA phages.

By manipulating the growth conditions of Escherichia coli both before and after 
phage MS2 or phage T4 infections, a dependence of phage growth upon 
postinfection host amino acid biosynthesis can be inferred. Cells grown under 
repressing conditions for amino acid biosynthesis shifted to amino acid-free 
medium postinfection (in the absence of further host gene expression) are poor 
hosts for phage growth, whereas cells grown under derepressing conditions for 
amino acid biosynthesis are good hosts regardless of postinfection conditions; 
thus postinfection biosynthesis of amino acids utilizes performed host enzymes 
which still function to carry out their biosynthetic pathways during phage 
infections. Phage MS2 also appears to permit the derepression of host amino acid 
biosynthetic operons during the infection. A functional dependence of MS2 growth 
upon postinfection host gene function is perhaps the strongest argument that the 
RNA phage do not shut off host messenger RNA and protein synthesis.

[Ribosomal protein S1 in the complex of E. coli ribosomal subunit 30S with phage 
MS2 RNA interacts with internal region of the replicase gene].

[Article in Russian]

Boni IV, Isaeva DM, Budovskiĭ EI.

The MS2 RNA fragments bound to ribosomal protein S1 within the complex of MS2 
RNA with 30S ribosomal subunit have been isolated using a specially developed 
procedure and sequenced by the base-specific enzymatic method. The S1-binding 
site on MS2 RNA was identified as UUUCUUACAUGACAAAUCCUUGUCAUG and mapped within 
the replicase gene at positions 2030-2056. This finding suggests that 
ribosome-MS2 RNA interaction involves at least two different regions of the 
phage RNA--the internal region of the replicase gene (S1-binding site) and 
ribosome-binding site of the coat protein gene. The possible spatial proximity 
between these two regions is discussed.

Methodology for enumeration of coliphages in foods.

Kennedy JE Jr, Wei CI, Oblinger JL.

The effects of eluent composition, pH, and chaotropic agents on the recovery of 
T2, MS2, and indigenous coliphages from various foods were investigated. 
Additionally, methods of sample suspension and clarification were evaluated for 
coliphage recovery and application to various foods. Clarified sample 
suspensions were assayed for coliphages with a modified agar layer technique and 
appropriate Escherichia coli hosts. Centrifugation and polypropylene mesh 
filtration were more rapid and effective than glass wool filtration for 
clarification of sample suspensions and subsequent recovery of coliphages. 
Blending, stomaching, and shaking procedures were generally comparable for 
sample liquefaction and release of coliphages from foods. Complex basal eluents, 
EC medium and 1% casein, were generally more effective than a less complex 
eluent, phosphate buffer, for elution of coliphages from foods. For most foods, 
incorporation of sodium chloride or chaotropic agents, i.e., sodium 
trichloroacetate, urea, Tween 80, Triton X-100, and sodium nitrate, into basal 
eluents did not enhance recovery of coliphages. Indigenous coliphage recovery 
was not affected by sample suspension pH over a range of 6.0 to 9.0. With an 
optimal procedure, i.e., EC medium eluent, blending, and centrifugation, the 
recovery of T2 and MS2 ranged from 48 to 81% and from 58 to 100%, respectively, 
depending on the food type.

Secondary structure as primary determinant of the efficiency of ribosomal 
binding sites in Escherichia coli.

Looman AC, Bodlaender J, de Gruyter M, Vogelaar A, van Knippenberg PH.

Using a previously described vector (pKL203) we fused several heterologous 
ribosomal binding sites (RBSs) to the lacZ gene of E. coli and then studied the 
variation in expression of the fusions. The RBSs originated from bacteriophage Q 
beta and MS2 genes and the E. coli genes for elongation factor EF-Tu A and B and 
ribosomal protein L11 (rplK). The synthesis of the lacZ fusion proteins was 
measured by an immuno precipitation method and found to vary at least 100-fold. 
Lac-specific mRNA synthesis follows the variation in protein production. It 
appears that there is a correlation between the efficiency of an RBS to function 
in the expression of the fused gene and the lack of secondary structure, 
involving the Shine and Dalgarno nucleotides (SDnts) and/or the initiation 
codon. This efficiency is context dependent. The sequence of the SD nts and the 
length and sequence of the spacer region up to the initiation codon alone are 
not able to explain our results. Deletion mutations, created in the phage Q beta 
replicase RBS, reveal a complex pattern of control of expression, probably 
involving the use of a "false" initiation site.

Use of geostatistics to predict virus decay rates for determination of septic 
tank setback distances.

Yates MV, Yates SR, Warrick AW, Gerba CP.

Water samples were collected from 71 public drinking-water supply wells in the 
Tucson, Ariz., basin. Virus decay rates in the water samples were determined 
with MS-2 coliphage as a model virus. The correlations between the virus decay 
rates and the sample locations were shown by fitting a spherical model to the 
experimental semivariogram. Kriging, a geostatistical technique, was used to 
calculate virus decay rates at unsampled locations by using the known values at 
nearby wells. Based on the regional characteristics of groundwater flow and the 
kriged estimates of virus decay rates, a contour map of the area was 
constructed. The map shows the variation in separation distances that would have 
to be maintained between wells and sources of contamination to afford similar 
degrees of protection from viral contamination of the drinking water in wells 
throughout the basin.

Characterization of an intergroup serological mutant from group II RNA phage GA.

Harigai H, Furuse K, Inokuchi Y, Hirashima A.

Starting from the group II RNA phage GA which has an amber mutation in the 
maturation protein cistron, a spontaneous mutant of group II phage GA, whose 
serological and electrophoretic properties became similar to those of group I 
phage MS2, was isolated and analyzed. The mutant has now become sensitive to 
anti-MS2 serum and resistant to anti-GA serum. Analysis of the nucleotide 
sequence of the coat protein gene revealed that G----A transition was the main 
change. The deduced amino acid sequence showed that five amino acids were 
substituted in the mutant, and three of the five became identical to MS2, 
resulting in increased molecular weight of the coat protein. However, it did not 
complement MS2. These results suggested that the serological change from group 
II phage GA type to group I phage MS2 type is induced spontaneously at high 
frequency by minor nucleotide changes in coat protein gene, and confirmed the 
previous results at the RNA level that MS2 and GA were related although the 
closeness between them seems somewhat remoter than that of groups III and IV 
(18, Inokuchi et al, unpublished data for the nucleotide sequence of group IV 
phage SP).

Determination of the RNA secondary structure that regulates lysis gene 
expression in bacteriophage MS2.

The lysis gene of the RNA bacteriophage MS2 is not expressed unless translation 
of the overlapping coat gene takes place. To understand the molecular basis for 
this translational coupling the RNA secondary structure around the lysis gene 
start was analyzed with structure-specific enzymes and chemicals. The existence 
of a hairpin between nucleotides 1636 and 1707 is in agreement with the 
structural mapping data and also with the conservation of base-pairing in the 
related M12 phage. In this hairpin, the G residues in the Shine and Dalgarno 
region and start codon are inaccessible to RNase T1, which is consistent with 
the fact that ribosomal access to the lysis gene is blocked when there is no 
coat gene translation. Deletions or point mutations that are predicted to 
destabilize the hairpin give rise to lysis protein synthesis that is independent 
of coat gene translation. Base substitutions that are not expected to weaken the 
helix do not lead to independent lysis gene expression. Finally, nucleotide 
changes that strengthen the hairpin lead neither to uncoupled nor to coupled 
synthesis of the lysis protein. Structural analysis of mutant MS2 RNA shows that 
small changes in the stability of the secondary structure lead to substantial 
differences in translation initiation. The function of the hairpin structure in 
coupling lysis gene to coat gene translation requires that its stability is kept 
within narrow limits.

Lysis gene of bacteriophage MS2 is activated by translation termination at the 
overlapping coat gene.

Berkhout B(1), Schmidt BF, van Strien A, van Boom J, van Westrenen J, van Duin 
J.

The 3' boundary of the coat gene of the RNA bacteriophage MS2 lies 46 
nucleotides downstream from the beginning of the lysis (L) cistron. The 
translation of both reading frames is coupled; the synthesis of the lysis 
protein does not occur unless translation of the overlapping coat gene takes 
place. In the preceding paper we showed that de novo initiation at the L gene is 
prevented by a hairpin structure that sequesters the ribosomal binding site. 
Here we examine how translation of the coat gene activates the L gene start 
site. The experiments show that the movement of ribosomes through the hairpin is 
in itself not sufficient to expose the lysis gene. Rather, the endpoint of 
translation is important. Termination at the natural end of the coat gene 
triggers the lysis response, but further downstream terminations do not. 
Activation of the L gene is suppressed when the stability of the lysis initiator 
hairpin is increased by mutations that create additional base-pairs. We assume 
that the ribosome, terminating at the coat reading frame, covers part of the 
lysis hairpin, thereby destabilizing the secondary structure. This may be 
sufficient to promote the binding of a vacant ribosome to the L gene start. 
Alternatively, the terminated but not yet released ribosome may reach the L gene 
start by random lateral movements along the mRNA and reinitiate there. The 
present findings are also discussed in relation to an earlier proposal for L 
gene activation.

Bacteriophages and indicator bacteria in human and animal faeces.

Havelaar AH, Furuse K, Hogeboom WM.

In an attempt to explain the presence of F-specific (RNA) bacteriophages in 
waste-water, faecal material from humans and a variety of animals was examined. 
The phages were detected in appreciable numbers only in faeces from pigs, 
broiler chickens, sheep and calves but not from dogs, cows, horses and humans. 
Parallel examinations for somatic coliphages, thermotolerant coliforms, faecal 
streptococci and spores of sulphite-reducing clostridia revealed the consistent 
presence of these organisms in all types of samples, albeit in variable numbers. 
The number of F-specific bacteriophages was related to the total number of 
somatic coliphages, but phage counts were unrelated to bacterial counts. 
F-specific RNA phages were grouped by serotyping and all animal isolates were 
found to belong to either group I (MS2 subtype) or IV (four different subtypes). 
Among the group IV isolates, most belonged to well-known subtypes SP (24 
isolates) or FI (18 isolates) but five isolates were related to phage ID2 and 
one isolate was a new subtype. In contrast with animal isolates, 19 isolates 
from hospital wastewater belonged to serogroups II or III.

The complete nucleotide sequence of the group II RNA coliphage GA.

Inokuchi Y, Takahashi R, Hirose T, Inayama S, Jacobson AB, Hirashima A.

The complete nucleotide sequence of the RNA coliphage GA, a group II phage, is 
presented. The entire genome comprises 3466 bases. Three large open reading 
frames were identified, which correspond to the maturation protein gene (390 
amino acids), the coat protein gene (129 amino acids) and the replicase 
beta-subunit protein gene (531 amino acids). In addition, untranslated regions 
occur at the 5' (135 bases) and 3' (122 bases) ends of the molecule. Two 
intercistronic untranslated regions occur between the cistrons for the 
maturation and coat proteins, and between the coat and beta-subunit proteins. We 
have compared the nucleotide sequence of GA RNA with the published sequence of 
MS2 RNA, and show that they are related. The comparative structures of two 
important regulatory regions are presented; the coat protein binding site which 
is involved in translational repression of the replicase beta-subunit protein 
gene, and a hairpin in a region proximal to the lysis protein gene.

Characterization of ribosomal frameshift events by protein sequence analysis.

Dayhuff TJ, Atkins JF, Gesteland RF.

In cell-free protein synthesis studies with RNA from phage MS2 as template, 
normal Escherichia coli tRNASer3 promotes two base translocation at GCA alanine 
codons with a resultant shift of ribosomes to the minus one reading frame. 
Similarly, normal tRNAThr3 promotes two base translocation at CCG proline 
codons. These conclusions were reached by amino acid sequencing of tryptic 
peptides or cyanogen bromide fragments that contained the reading frame shift 
site. It is proposed that these frameshift events occur by a two-base pair 
interaction between the anticodons of these exceptional tRNAs and the noncognate 
codons.

Thermal activation of tritium gas is used for labeling of the nucleoprotein,

radioactivity of 20-50 Ci/mmole, is considerably infectious and appears suitable 
for a wide range of studies. The radioactivity is distributed between intraphage 
RNA and phage outer protein (approximately 1:3 ratio). Consequently, phage 
capsid is porous and sufficiently permeable for activated tritium atoms.

Single crystals of the bacteriophage MS2 have been produced by the vapour 
diffusion technique in the presence of 1.5% polyethylene glycol 6000 and 0.2 
M-sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). These are the first bacteriovirus crystals 
diffracting to high resolution. The crystal space group is C2 with the unit cell 
parameters a = 467.9 A, b = 289.5 A, c = 275.6 A and beta = 121.8 degrees. The 
asymmetric unit contains one half of the virion. The maximum resolution limit of 
the X-ray diffraction data obtained from these crystals was 2.9 A. The 
purification of the virus material was done by mild procedures exclusively and 
involved precipitation with polyethylene glycol 6000 and size exclusion 
chromatography on Sepharose CL-4B.

Translational interference at overlapping reading frames in prokaryotic 
messenger RNA.

Berkhout B, Kastelein RA, van Duin J.

In overlapping reading frames of prokaryotic mRNA, the ribosome-binding site 
(RBS) of the downstream cistron is part of the coding sequence of the upstream 
message. We have examined whether the rate of translation in Escherichia coli 
can be sufficiently high to preclude the use of an RBS in initiation of protein 
synthesis when it is part of an actively decoded reading frame. The two sets of 
gene overlap present in the RNA phage MS2 are used as a model system. We find 
that translation of an upstream cistron can fully block initiation of protein 
synthesis at the overlapping RBS of the downstream cistron. Nonsense mutations 
in the upstream gene restore the translation of the downstream gene.

Mechanism of translational coupling between coat protein and replicase genes of 
RNA bacteriophage MS2.

Berkhout B, van Duin J.

We have analyzed the molecular mechanism that makes translation of the MS2 
replicase cistron dependent on the translation of the upstream coat cistron. 
Deletion mapping on cloned cDNA of the phage shows that the ribosomal binding 
site of the replicase cistron is masked by a long distance basepairing to an 
internal coat cistron region. Removal of the internal coat cistron region leads 
to uncoupled replicase synthesis. Our results confirm the model as originally 
proposed by Min Jou et al. (1). Activation of the replicase start is sensitive 
to the frequency of upstream translation, but never reaches the level of 
uncoupled replicase synthesis.

Temperature-sensitive translation of MS2 bacteriophage RNA.

Armstrong-Major J, Champney WS.

A comparison was made of bacteriophage MS2 RNA translation in infected 
Escherichia coli cells and in a defined cell-free system. A number of 
temperature-sensitive mutants were used as hosts for viral RNA translation at 
permissive and restrictive temperatures. The amount of viral coat protein 
synthesis was determined after gel electrophoresis of proteins from the cell 
lysates. These results were compared to those obtained with cell-free 
translation assays conducted with ribosomes isolated from the same mutants. 
Compared with control cells, a reduced activity in vivo and in vitro was found 
for each mutant examined at elevated temperatures. A good correlation between 
the two types of translational assays was observed. These findings are discussed 
in terms of the translational defects known to be a characteristic of some of 
these mutant strains.

Isolation and point of action of a factor from Escherichia coli required to 
reconstruct translation.

Ganoza MC, Cunningham C, Green RM.

To study the mechanism of translation we have attempted to reconstruct the 
process from purified components. Protein synthesis was programmed by the RNAs 
of wild-type or amber mutants of bacteriophages f2 or MS2. Translation 
programmed by MS2 or f2am3 RNA does not occur using ribosomes, precharged 
aminoacyl-tRNAs, and the sum of the purified proteins involved in initiation 
(initiation factors; IF-1, IF-2, and IF-3), propagation (elongation factors; 
EF-Tu, EF-Ts, and EF-G) and termination (release factors; RF-1 or RF-2) of 
protein synthesis. The requirement for a protein called W was demonstrated. 
Protein W was purified free of all translation factors, activating enzymes, and 
other proteins such as the RR, "rescue," and EF-P implicated in translation. The 
stimulation of propagation by W depended on the position of the amino acid 
residue to be added in the synthesis of the NH2-terminal hexapeptide of the coat 
protein. In the reconstructed system, with the sum of all translation factors 
but in the absence of W, only dipeptides and smaller quantities of tripeptides 
were synthesized under the direction of f2am3 RNA. W stimulated the synthesis of 
the hexapeptide, fMet-Ala-Ser-AspNH2-Phe-Thr directed by this RNA. In addition, 
W stimulated ejection of non-cognate tRNAs that bind to ribosomal particles.

The amino terminal half of the MS2-coded lysis protein is dispensable for 
function: implications for our understanding of coding region overlaps.

Berkhout B, de Smit MH, Spanjaard RA, Blom T, van Duin J.

We have asked whether genetic overlaps only evolve to provide extra coding 
capacity in genomes of restricted size. As a model system we have used the lysis 
gene of the RNA bacteriophage MS2. This gene overlaps with the distal part of 
the coat protein gene and with the proximal part of the replicase gene. Using 
recombinant DNA procedures we have determined whether either of the two overlaps 
codes for amino acids that are not essential for the function of the 75 amino 
acid long lysis protein. We find that the first 40 amino acids of the lysis 
protein are dispensable for function. Thus all of the genetic information 
essential to the synthesis of the active C-terminal peptide lies within the 
overlap with the replicase gene, whereas all dispensable residues are encoded in 
the overlap with the coat protein gene and in the intercistronic region. This 
suggests that the overlap with the coat protein gene is not required for extra 
coding capacity but serves to regulate the expression of the lysis gene. 
Comparative sequence analysis is consistent with this idea.

Effects of heterologous ribosomal binding sites on the transcription and 
translation of the lacZ gene of Escherichia coli.

Looman AC, de Gruyter M, Vogelaar A, van Knippenberg PH.

A vector (pKL203) was constructed which contains the promoter-operator region of 
the lacZ gene and the major part of the coding sequence of the lac operon. The 
lacZ translation initiation signals [Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence and AUG codon] 
were deleted, and in their place a synthetic linker sequence was inserted, 
providing single restriction sites for SmaI and BamHI. With this vector 
constructions were made in which initiation signals of other prokaryotic genes 
(phage MS2 maturation protein, phage Q beta A2 gene and tufB gene) were fused to 
the lacZ gene, giving rise to various fusion proteins. The introduction of 
N-terminal amino acids (aa) in beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) which differ from 
the wild-type aa invariably leads to an enzyme with a strongly reduced 
thermostability as compared to the wild-type enzyme. Therefore an 
immunoprecipitation method was used to measure the amount of fusion protein. It 
was found that these amounts varied strongly from one construction to another. 
Concomitant determinations of the amounts of lac-operon-specific mRNA showed an 
unexpectedly large variation among the clones. No strict correlation could be 
found between the level of lac mRNA and beta-gal production. Per molecule of lac 
mRNA, translation appears to be most efficient when the homologous lacZ 
initiation signal is present.

Small-angle X-ray and light scattering studies on the influence of Mg2+ ions on 
the structure of the RNA from bacteriophage MS2.

Ribitsch G, De Clercq R, Folkhard W, Zipper P, Schurz J, Clauwaert J.

The influence of Mg2+ ions on the secondary and tertiary structure of the RNA 
from bacteriophage MS2 was investigated by small-angle X-ray scattering and 
light scattering and by sedimentation experiments. The analysis of the outer 
part of the X-ray scattering curve obtained at low temperature in the absence of 
Mg2+ yielded a cross-section radius of gyration of 0.88 nm and a mass per unit 
length of 1720 g mol-1 nm-1. Very similar values for these parameters, which 
refer to the secondary structure of the RNA molecule, were also derived from the 
X-ray scattering curves obtained in the presence of different amounts of Mg2+ 
(0.07 to 1 ions per nucleotide). On the contrary, the inner part of the X-ray 
scattering curves turned out to be highly dependent on the Mg2+ concentration: 
the cross-section radius of gyration and the mass per unit length, which were 
determined from the scattering curves at small angles as parameters related to 
the tertiary structure of the RNA, amounted to 3.11 nm and 4000 g mol-1 nm-1, 
respectively, in the absence of Mg2+ and increased significantly upon raising 
the concentration of Mg2+. The increase of these structural parameters was found 
to be accompanied by a decrease of the overall radius of gyration (as revealed 
indirectly by X-ray scattering and directly by light scattering measurements) 
and by an increase of the sedimentation coefficient. The results from the 
investigations of the RNA at low temperature clearly establish the existence of 
double-stranded structures down to very low Mg2+ concentrations as well as the 
occurrence of Mg2+ induced changes of the tertiary structure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED

Virus persistence in groundwater.

Yates MV, Gerba CP, Kelley LM.

More than 50% of the outbreaks of waterborne disease in the United States are 
due to the consumption of contaminated groundwater. An estimated 65% of the 
cases in these outbreaks are caused by enteric viruses. Little, however, is 
known about the persistence of viruses in groundwater. The purpose of this study 
was to determine whether measurable chemical and physical factors correlate with 
virus survival in groundwater. Groundwater samples were obtained from 11 sites 
throughout the United States. Water temperature was measured at the time of 
collection. Several physical and chemical characteristics, including pH, 
nitrates, turbidity, and hardness, were determined for each sample. Separate 
water samples were inoculated with each of three viruses (poliovirus 1, 
echovirus 1, and MS-2 coliphage) and incubated at the in situ groundwater 
temperature; selected samples were also incubated at other temperatures. Assays 
were performed at predetermined intervals over a 30-day period to determine the 
number of infective viruses remaining. Multiple regression analysis revealed 
that temperature was the only variable significantly correlated with the decay 
rates of all three viruses. No significant differences were found among the 
decay rates of the three viruses, an indication that MS-2 coliphage might be 
used as a model of animal virus survival in groundwater.

[Principles of selective inactivation of the viral genome. III. Kinetics of the 
inactivation of bacteriophage MS2 infectivity by beta-propiolactone].

[Article in Russian]

Budovskiĭ EI, Zalesskaia MA.

It is shown that the action of beta-propiolactone on the bacteriophage MS2 under 
the wide range of conditions (pH, temperature, initial concentration of the 
reagent) the survival curves could be accurately described, taking into account 
the reagent consumption during inactivation. The requirements for accurate 
description of the infectivity inactivation of viruses by the action of any 
chemical agent were formulated. That allowed rational development of a principal 
stage in preparation of the killed antiviral vaccines--inactivation of the virus 
infectivity to the necessary extent by the action of chemical agents.

[Possible commonality of origin of the RNA polymerase genes of 
plus-RNA-containing viruses of bacteria, plants and animals].

[Article in Russian]

Morozov SIu, Rupasov VV.

The data given testify that picornavirus RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase, 
RNA-polymerase encoded by the genome of MS2 phage and the certain polypeptides 
involved in the replication of RNA genomes of alphaviruses, tobamoviruses and 
tricornaviruses include the homologous stretches of the amino acids. The common 
sequences are located in the COOH-terminal regions of the viral proteins. These 
sequences have been found to be conserved also in RNA-replicase MS2 phage. The 
similarity of the primary structure between the RNA-polymerase phages and 
proteins of eucaryotic plus-RNA-containing viruses testifies in favour of the 
hypothesis on possible ancestral relationship of virus RNA-polymerases genes. 
These data point out that it is possible to localize an indispensable functional 
domain conserved upon evolutionary divergence of an ancestral RNA-polymerase 
gene. Such conservative region is recently found in the composition of 
RNA-dependent DNA-polymerases animals and plants virus. An attention is drawn to 
the region of protein similarity between conservative domains of viral 
RNA-dependent DNA-polymerases and RNA-polymerases.

Ribonucleic acid bacteriophage release: requirement for host-controlled protein 
synthesis.

Engelberg H, Soudry E.

The release of the ribonucleic acid (RNA)-containing phage MS2 from Escherichia 
coli is accompanied by cellular lysis at 37 C, whereas at 30 C phage are 
released from intact cells. Chloramphenicol or rifampin prevents the release of 
progeny phage particles at both temperatures. Neither drug causes an immediate 
cessation of phage release and after inhibition of protein synthesis by 
chloramphenicol phage release proceeds for about 17 min at 37 C and about 35 min 
at 30 C. Rifampin does not inhibit phage release from mutant cells possessing a 
rifampin-resistant deoxyribonucleic acid-dependent RNA polymerase. The results 
indicate that a short-lived host-controlled protein(s) is essential for the 
release of RNA phage particles at both temperatures.

Studies on sex pili: mutants of the sex factor F in Escherichia coli defective 
in bacteriophage-adsorbing function of F pili.

Tomoeda M, Shuta A, Inuzuka M.

Ultraviolet irradiation or nitrosoguanidine treatment of Escherichia coli K-12 
strain JE3100 (F'(8)/fla pil) led to the isolation of six mutants defective in F 
pili function. The defects were shown to be caused by mutations in the F factor. 
The mutants retained conjugal fertility, although they were less efficient than 
parental F'(8) strain, and continued to synthesize F pili. Three of the mutants 
(strains KE196, 198, and 200) had lost sensitivity to male-specific MS2 phage, 
and the other three (strains KE161, 163, and 164) were insensitive to Qbeta and 
f1 as well as MS2 phages. F pili on strains KE196, 198, and 200 cells continued 
to adsorb MS2 phage, whereas those of strains KE161, 163, and 164 did not adsorb 
MS2 phage. The correlation of the mutant phenotypes with those of other F 
mutants reported in the literature is discussed.

RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity of RNA tumor viruses. II. Directing 
influence of RNA in the reaction.

Leis JP, Hurwitz J.

The role of ribonucleic acid (RNA) in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis with 
the purified DNA polymerase from the avian myeloblastosis virus has been 
studied. The polymerase catalyzes the synthesis of DNA in the presence of four 
deoxynucleoside triphosphates, Mg(2+), and a variety of RNA templates including 
those isolated from avian myeloblastosis, Rous sarcoma, and Rauscher leukemia 
viruses; phages f2, MS2, and Qbeta; and synthetic homopolymers such as 
polyadenylate.polyuridylic acid. The enzyme does not initiate the synthesis of 
new chains but incorporates deoxynucleotides at 3' hydroxyl ends of primer 
strands. The product is an RNA.DNA hybrid in which the two polynucleotide 
components are covalently linked. Free DNA has not been detected among the 
products formed with the purified enzyme in vitro. The DNA synthesized with 
avian myeloblastosis virus RNA after alkaline hydrolysis has a sedimentation 
coefficient of 6 to 7S.

Effects of guanosine tetraphosphate, guanosine pentaphosphate, and beta-gamma 
methylenyl-guanosine pentaphosphate on gene expression of Escherichia coli in 
vitro.

Yang HL, Zubay G, Urm E, Heiness G, Cashel M.

The effects of guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp) and guanosine pentaphosphate 
(pppGpp), both produced by E. coli, were measured on the activities of several 
genes in a cell-free system. Gene activity is measured as gene-directed 
synthesis of biochemically competent protein or transfer RNA. Both ppGpp and 
pppGpp stimulated the activities of the ara, lac, and trp operons and inhibited 
the arg operon. Production of transfer-RNA(Tyr) was unaffected by moderate 
levels of either ppGpp or pppGpp and only slightly inhibited at higher levels of 
ppGpp. Since the cell-free reaction mixtures hydrolyze pppGpp to ppGpp, we 
performed similar studies with a hydrolysis-resistant analog of pppGpp, the 
beta-gamma methylenyl derivative (pcppGpp). In general, pcppGpp shows the same 
inhibitory potency as pppGpp for the arg operon, but lacks the stimulatory 
effects on the ara, lac, and trp operons. This result suggests that the 
stimulation of these gene activities is specific for ppGpp.Under similar 
conditions, pppGpp and ppGpp show a slight inhibitory effect on the 
messenger-directed synthesis of beta-galactosidase and no effect on the 
messenger-directed synthesis of MS2 viral-coat protein. These observations, 
together with the fact that in the same system these nucleotides affect coupled 
transcription and translation, lead us to surmise that the activities of pppGpp 
and ppGpp are exerted at the level of RNA polymerase activity.

Introduction of specific cleavages into RNAs of RNA bacteriophages for 
determination of base sequences.

Fuke M.

Large fragments of R17, MS2, and Qbeta RNAs were obtained reproducibly by 
limited digestion by ribonuclease T1. After digestion of R17 and MS2 RNAs, two 
pairs of large fragments were obtained that probably resulted from specific 
cleavages of the whole molecules. The cleavages of MS2 RNA were produced at 
points 36 and 47% from the 5' end.

Messenger selection by bacterial ribosomes.

Leffler S, Szer W.

The counterpart of Escherichia coli initiation factor 3(IF-3) was isolated from 
Caulobacter crescentus, purified to homogeneity, and used in comparative studies 
on in vitro translation of RNA from the C. crescentus RNA phage Cb5 and of 
coliphage MS2 RNA. The two phage RNAs are similar in physical properties and 
analogous in genetic content. The factor, C-IF-3, substitutes for E. coli IF-3 
and promotes correct translation of MS2 RNA by E. coli ribosomes. Conversely, E. 
coli IF-3 substitutes for C-IF-3 in translation of Cb5 RNA by C. crescentus 
ribosomes. However, each phage RNA could be translated only by host ribosomes or 
by mixed ribosomes containing the host 30S subunit. C-IF-3 dissociates C. 
crescentus and E. coli 70S ribosomes into subunits. It binds phage, ribosomal, 
and, less efficiently, transfer RNA.

Use of miracil D to suppress bacterial ribonucleic acid and protein synthesis 
during bacteriophage MS2 infection.

Cramer JH, Sinsheimer RL.

Under certain culture conditions, Miracil (35 mug/ml) halts the growth of 
uninfected Escherichia coli. Cellular ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis is almost 
completely suppressed, whereas deoxyribonucleic acid and protein synthesis are 
inhibited to a lesser extent. When the drug is added to host bacteria prior to 
infection with bacteriophage MS2, the phage adsorb to the cells, but penetration 
of the viral RNA is inhibited. Penetration may be achieved without further viral 
development by infection in the presence of chloramphenicol. If the bacteria are 
infected with MS2 in the presence of chloramphenicol, subsequently washed to 
remove the chloramphenicol, and then treated with Miracil at any time between 0 
and 20 min postinfection, a second viral function is inhibited and the yield of 
progeny phage is reduced. Addition of the drug after 20 min postinfection does 
not inhibit the infection process. When Miracil is present from early times in 
infection, only a limited synthesis of both double- and single-stranded 
virus-specific RNA is observed. The viral RNA species thus produced do not 
appear to differ from those made in the absence of the drug. A comparison of the 
activities of the viral RNA synthetase produced during the course of infection 
in the presence and in the absence of Miracil suggests that a possible cause of 
the inhibition is the synthesis of an unstable enzyme in the presence of the 
drug.

Host-virus interactions in Escherichia coli: effect of stationary phase on viral

Ricciuti CP.

Infection of stationary-phase Escherichia coli with MS2 bacteriophage results in

protein synthesis in stationary-phase cells indicates that general protein 
synthesis is not sufficient to assure cell lysis or viral release.

Fermentation process for double-stranded ribonucleic acid, an interferon 
inducer.

Lago BD, Birnbaum J, Demain AL.

Double-stranded ribonucleic acid (ds-RNA) isolated from Escherichia coli 
infected with bacteriophage MS2 is a potent interferon inducer. High levels of 
ds-RNA are formed in nonpermissive cells infected with MU9, an amber coat 
protein mutant of MS2. This mutant has been used to develop a process for 
large-scale ds-RNA production. Preparation of quantities of MU9 lysate 
sufficient for ds-RNA production in fermentors is described. Over 300 mug of 
ds-RNA/ml can be accumulated after MU9 infection of cultures grown to high 
density in corn steep liquor medium. This is approximately 300 times the amount 
of ds-RNA made by MS2 infection of cells grown in tryptone medium. Maximum 
ds-RNA formation requires only 3 hr. The ds-RNA is stable and remains inside 
nonaerated cells for at least 17 hr.

Inhibition of formation of Escherichia coli mating pairs by f1 and MS2 
bacteriophages as determined with a Coulter counter.

Ou JT.

The effect of male-specific filamentous deoxyribonucleic acid (f1) and isometric 
ribonucleic acid (MS2) bacteriophages on the formation of mating pairs in 
Escherichia coli conjugation was examined directly in the Coulter counter. When 
a sufficient multiplicity of infection (MOI) was used, the f1 phage immediately 
and completely inhibited the formation of mating pairs. On the other hand, the 
MS2 phage at a relatively high MOI also inhibited the formation of mating pairs 
significantly although not completey. The inhibitory effect of MS2 phage was 
dependent on the time of addition and the MOI used. At relatively low MOI (<20), 
the MS2 phage showed some inhibitory effect when added to a male culture prior 
to mixing with females, whereas no effect was observed when phages were added 
after mating pair formation had already commenced. At a high MOI (>400) MS2 
phage disrupted the mating pairs already formed. Some preformed mating pairs 
were resistant to the high MOI of MS2 phages, however, and the "sensitive" (to 
high MOI) mating pairs seem to mature into "resistant" mating pairs as a 
function of time. We conclude that the tip of an F pilus is the specific 
attachment site for mating. The following process of mating pair formation has 
been formulated by deduction. (i) The sides of F pili weakly contact female 
cells, (ii) then the tips of F pili attach to the specific receptor sites to 
form initial mating pairs, and (iii) those pairs mature into mating pairs that 
are resistant to the high MOI of MS2 phages. The high MOI of MS2 prevents the 
first step, whereas f1 phages affect the second step-the binding between the 
tips of F pili and the receptor sites.

A specific inhibitor of polypeptide-chain initiation in Escherichia coli.

Lee-Huang S, Lee H, Ochoa S.

An inhibitor of polypeptide-chain initiation was isolated from E. coli cells. 
This protein inhibits formation of the 30S or 70S initiation complex with either 
fMet-tRNA(f) as initiator and AUG, MS2 RNA, or late T4 RNA as messenger, or 
acPhe-tRNA as initiator and poly(U) as messenger. Chain elongation, e.g., 
poly(U) translation at high Mg(2+) concentration, is not inhibited. The 
inhibitor is rendered ineffective when active aminoacylation of tRNA is taking 
place, e.g., during natural mRNA translation. This inhibitor is distinct from 
the so-called interference (i) factors, which interfere exclusively with the 
action of initiation factor 3. Since the new inhibitor can apparently be turned 
on and off, it may have a regulatory function in translation.

Interaction of some factors in the mechanism of inactivation of bacteriophage 
MS2 in aerosols.

Trouwborst T, de Jong JC.

The mechanisms involving inactivation of bacteriophage MS2 in aerosols and the 
effect of protective substances in the spray-medium were studied after spraying 
from various NaCl solutions. Results with aerosols generated from the salt 
solutions showed that with higher salt concentration in the spray-medium higher 
concentrations of protective substances were needed to protect phage MS2 against 
aerosol inactivation. Phenylalanine, which has a protective action at low 
concentration, produced less protection in aerosol droplets that were 
supersaturated solutions of this substance or in which crystals of phenylalanine 
can be expected to form. Our results suggested that protection by peptone and 
phenylalanine was related to the concentration in the aerosol droplet after 
evaporation to equilibrium, whereas protection by the surface active agent OED 
(a commercial mixture of oxyethylene docosylether and oxyethelene 
octadecylether) was related to the concentration at which a monolayer is formed 
around the aerosol particle. Inactivation of phage MS2 was maximal in the 
aerosol particle in fluid phase and became less at lower relative humidity where 
aerosol particles are expected to be in the solid state. It is suggested that 
inactivation of bacteriophage MS2 in aerosols could be explained by surface 
inactivation at the air-water interface.

Non-continuous translation of coat protein and ribonucleic acid polymerase 
cistrons in MS2 bacteriophage ribonucleic acid.

Grubman MJ, Nakada D.

In an MS2 phage ribonucleic acid (RNA)-directed in vitro protein-synthesizing 
system, the coat protein cistron and the adjacent RNA polymerase cistron are 
translated non-continuously. The ribosomes which have completed the synthesis of 
coat protein dissociate from the MS2 RNA and do not read through the 
intercistronic gap. Translation of the adjacent RNA polymerase cistron requires 
ribosomes other than those translating the coat protein cistron.

An Escherichia coli mutant with an altered elongation factor Tu.

Lupker JH, Verschoor GJ, de Rooij FW, Rörsch A, Bosch L.

A thermosensitive mutant of Escherichia coli has been isolated that is unable to 
replicate the bacteriophage MS2 at 42 degrees but permits phage production at 37 
degrees . Thermal inactivation studies of the supernatant enzymes show that this 
mutant contains a factor essential for the polymerization of phenylalanine from 
phenylalanyl-tRNA that at 50 degrees is more rapidly inactivated than the 
corresponding wild-type factor. The elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) was isolated 
and purified to apparent homogeneity as the EF-Tu.GDP complex, both from mutant 
and wild-type cells. Addition of purified wild-type EF-Tu.GDP to reaction 
mixtures fully restored the activity of thermally inactivated mutant 
supernatants. These experiments excluded EF-Ts as the thermolabile factor 
involved. Similar inactivation studies, dealing with the purified factors and 
performed in reaction mixtures that were not supplemented with GDP, revealed 
that the half-life of mutant EF-Tu.GDP at 50 degrees was 1.5 min, that of the 
wild-type factor 6 min. Addition of GDP (10muM) to the medium reduced the 
inactivation rate of both wild-type and mutant factor and also the difference in 
inactivation kinetics. Besides the altered elongation factor Tu, the mutant 
skill contains a second mutation affecting the glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase.

Synthesis of indicator strains and density of ribonucleic acid-containing 
coliphages in sewage.

Dhillon EK, Dhillon TS.

Escherichia coli strains freshly isolated from natural sources are inefficient 
indicators of coliphages present in sewage. Four E. coli strains recently 
isolated from clinical specimens were mutagenized to obtain lac(-) mutants. Such 
mutants were infected with an F'lac(+) sex factor of E. coli K-12. Pairs of 
isogenic lac(-) and lac(-)/F'lac(+) strains were used as indicators of 
coliphages present in sewage, and it was found that such strains can be 
effectively used for a direct and almost selective enumeration of F-specific 
coliphage contents of sewage samples. Serological tests were applied to a number 
of F-specific phages isolated. All the isolates that were tested fell into two 
distinguishable antigenic classes: members of one class being related to 
ribonucleic acid (RNA) phage MS2 and those of the other being related to another 
RNA phage, namely, Qbeta. MS2-related phages have been found to be more widely 
distributed than the Qbeta related phages. Most habitats sampled were found to 
yield only one or the other kind of phage. Single-stranded deoxyribonucleic 
acid-containing F-specific phages were not detectable by the methods employed by 
us.

The developmental cycle of bacteriophage MS2 in Escherichia coli was studied by

special fixation method made it possible to discern the individual phage 
particles from cellular ribosomes in the early infection stages and to follow 
the further development of the phage in the host bacterium. By means of the same 
techniques we have tried to obtain a better insight in the process of lysis of 
the infected cells.

Male-specific bacteriophage MS2 propagation in fluorophenylalanine-resistant 
Escherichia coli K12.

Jenkins ST, Beard JP, Howe TG.

Mutation of Escherichia coli K12 HfrH to resistance to fluorophenylalanine 
resulted in changes in the plaque morphology of bacteriophage MS2 on this strain 
and led to an increased efficiency of propagation of the phage in liquid 
cultures. Evidence was obtained that the mutation resulted in inhibition of 
early lysis in infected cells and that lysis involved the production of a 
lysozyme. Genetic studies suggested that the observed pleiotropy of the 
resistance mutation was due to informational suppression.

Two classes of membrane binding of replicative RNA of bacteriophage MS2.

Haywood AM.

Escherichia coli membranes were isolated in the presence of 6 mM Mg(++). They 
were washed with buffer containing no Mg(++) to yield a fraction containing 
material bound only in the presence of divalent cations, "membrane eluate," and 
that bound in the absence of divalent cations, "membrane." When E. coli infected 
with bacteriophage MS2 are labeled with [(14)C]uracil, all MS2 replicative RNA, 
i.e., the RNA species containing MS2 complementary RNA, is in the membrane 
eluate and membrane. The amount of [(14)C]uracil in replicative RNA found in the 
membrane eluate increases with time of labeling, whereas that in the replicative 
RNA in the membrane reaches a plateau in 1-2 min. This finding is consistent 
with a precursor-product relationship. Most of the label entering 
single-stranded viral RNA comes from the replicative RNA in the membrane eluate. 
This result suggests that polymerase components or factors required for 
complementary-strand synthesis are bound to membrane even in the absence of 
divalent cations and that the polymerase is no longer bound to these factors 
when it is making the bulk of the progeny single-stranded RNA.

Intermediates of bacteriophage MS2 assembly in vivo.

Bonner PH.

The in vivo process of virion assembly was studied in rifampin-treated, 
MS2-infected Escherichia coli during late times of infection-after 18 min 
postinfection. Differential sucrose gradient sedimentation of infected-cell 
lysates taken at various times after radioactive labeling indicated a definite 
temporal order of appearance of phage-specific protein in assembly-related 
structures. Labeled MS2 protein appears first as a low-molecular-weight peak at 
the tops of gradients, then as a peak at 40S and as a large number of almost 
unseparable structures between 40 and 80S, and finally as 80S mature phage 
particles. During the chase of a short labeling period, radioactive phage 
protein was found to disappear from gradients in the same temporal order as it 
appeared; the soluble peak disappears first, followed by the 40 to 70S region. 
The chased label appears quantitatively in the 80S phage peak. Labeled phage RNA 
was found to appear first in the 40S peak, then in the structures between 40 and 
70S, and finally in 80S phage particles. The order of disappearance of labeled 
phage RNA during a chase is the same as its appearance. Resedimentation of the 
40 to 70S region indicated the presence of distinct structures at 60 and 70S and 
many indistinct ones between 40 and 60S. The smaller intermediates exhibit 
separable maturation protein-rich and coat protein-rich segments, indicating 
nonrandom binding of the two proteins during the initial steps of assembly. 
Larger, discrete intermediates appear at 60 and 70S. Treatment of the various 
structures with pancreatic RNase results in destruction of those from 40 through 
60S; treatment of the 70S structure results in the conversion of some of it to a 
45S peak, presumably the complete capsid. A small fraction of the 80S phage peak 
is also sensitive to RNase, resulting in a similar 45S peak. Pulse-chase 
experiments indicate that structures from 40 through 60S as well as the 
RNase-sensitive 70S structure are assembly intermediates, but that the 
RNase-insensitive 70S and the RNase-sensitive 80S structures are not.

Interaction of Escherichia coli 30S ribosomal subunits with MS2 phage RNA in the 
absence of initiation factors.

Szer W, Leffler S.

MS2 RNA binds at 0 degrees to 30S subunits from E. coli and, to a smaller 
extent, to those of a Pseudomonas species, as judged by filtration on 
nitrocellulose membranes; this mRNA does not bind to 30S subunits from Bacillus 
brevis or Caulobacter crescentus. Binding does not depend on the presence of 
initiation factors; it is sensitive to aurintricarboxylic acid but insensitive 
to edeine and is competitive with such synthetic polynucleotides as poly(U) and 
poly(AUG). Complex formation can also be detected by electrophoresis on 
polyacrylamide-agarose gels. By this procedure, E. coli 30S subunits are 
separated into two major components. Only the more slowly moving component, 
which contains the ribosomal protein S1, interacts with the RNA.

Replacement of ribosomal protein S1 by interference factor ialpha in ribosomal 
binding of phage Ms2 RNA.

Hermoso JM, Szer W.

The MS2 RNA binding capacity of 30S ribosomal subunits, which is lost when 
protein S1 is removed, can be restored following incubation with interference 
factor ialpha and repelleting. Polyacrylamide-agarose gel electrophoresis shows 
that, under these conditions, a faster moving, non-RNA binding 30S species, 
which contains no S1, is converted to a slower moving RNA-binding one, having 
the same mobility as the 30S species that contains protein S1. Factor ialpha 
binds to single-stranded RNAs in a pattern that closely resembles the RNA 
binding pattern of initiation factor IF-3.

Localization of coliphage MS2 A-protein.

Curtiss LK, Krueger RG.

The purification of coliphage MS2 dinitrophenol (DNP) conjugates provided a 
system for localization of the single molecule of A-protein in the capsid of the 
MS2 phage particle. Three A-protein preparations isolated from unconjugated MS2, 
overconjugated DNP-MS2, and purified 78S DNP-MS2 were tested for the presence of 
covalently bound DNP. The binding characteristics to Dowex 1-X8 and rabbit 
anti-DNP bovine serum albumin (DNP-BSA) immunoglobulin G of the 78S DNP-MS2 and 
overconjugated DNP-MS2 A-protein preparations indicate that the A-protein is 
located on the surface of the phage particle where it can be covalently 
conjugated with hapten. Extensive enzymatic iodination of the A-protein of 
intact unconjugated MS2 substantiates this conclusion.

Airborne stability of tailless bacterial viruses S-13 and MS-2.

Dubovi EJ, Akers TG.

The effect of relative humidity (RH) on the airborne stability of two small 
bacterial viruses, S-13 and MS-2, was studied. Poorest recovery of S-13 was 
obtained at 50% RH. Humidification prior to aerosol sampling significantly 
increased the recovery of S-13 at RH deleterious to the airborne virus. A 
commercial preparation of MS-2 suspended in a buffered saline solution showed a 
rapid loss of viability at RH above 30%, whereas a laboratory preparation 
containing 1.3% tryptone showed high recoveries at all RH studied. Dilution of 
the commercial MS-2 into tryptone broth conferred stability on the airborne 
virus. Humidification prior to sampling significantly reduced the viable 
recovery from aerosols of commercial MS-2, whereas the laboratory preparation 
was unaffected.

Effect of fluorophenylalanine on bacteriophage MS2 replication.

Wray GW, Gimlin DM, Abdel-Hady SN, Sherard SK, Leach FR.

A concentration of 10 mug of fluorophenylalanine per ml added to a chemically 
defined medium reduced by 100-fold the number of bacteriophage MS2 produced on 
Escherichia coli C3000 and increased the latent period. Fluorophenylalanine was 
most effective when added concurrent with infection. Addition of a 10-fold 
greater concentration of phenylalanine reversed the inhibition caused by 
fluorophenylalanine. Radioactive fluorophenylalanine was incorporated into the 
coat protein. The four phenylalanine-containing chymotryptic peptides are not 
equally accessible to fluorophenylalanine. Only two of the peptides are highly 
labeled by fluorophenylalanine. Incorporation of fluorophenylalanine decreased 
the specific infectivity and the rate of adsorption but did not increase the 
sensitivity of the whole virus to ribonuclease. MS2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) 
functioned as messenger RNA for the incorporation of both phenylalanine and 
fluorophenylalanine in a cell-free incorporating system from E. coli.

Growth of male-specific bacteriophage in Pasteurella harboring F-genotes derived 
from Escherichia coli.

Molnar DM, Lawton WD.

When either the F' lac or the F'Cm plasmid was transferred from Escherichia coli 
into Pasteurella pseudotuberculosis, the P. pseudotuberculosis (F') strains 
isolated formed plaques with both ribonucleic acid (RNA)-containing and 
deoxyribonucleic acid-containing male-specific phages. In contrast, strains of 
P. pestis harboring E. coli (F') plasmids did not form plaques with 
male-specific phages, although such strains permitted limited multiplication of 
phage MS2. The adsorption and burst size of MS2 were approximately the same in 
both species of Pasteurella, but the per cent of adsorbed MS2 that produced 
infective centers was much lower in P. pestis than it was in P. 
pseudotuberculosis. By use of a sib-selection technique of P. pestis (F') cells, 
we isolated a single clone that could form MS2 plaques. (32)P-labeled MS2 
adsorbed equally to and its RNA penetrated equally into both the typical 
MS2-nonpermissive P. pestis cells and the MS2-permissive P. pestis cells. No 
host modification occurred after growth of MS2 in Pasteurella. Our data suggest 
that typical strains of P. pestis inhibit the intracellular development of phage 
MS2.

Ampicillin-resistant mutants of Escherichia coli K-12 with lipopolysaccharide 
alterations affecting mating ability and susceptibility to sex-specific 
bacteriophages.

Monner DA, Jonsson S, Boman HG.

Mutations from moderate (class I) to high (class III) ampicillin resistance in a 
male and a female strain of Escherichia coli K-12 have been found to be 
accompanied by surface alterations, first demonstrated as hindrance in the 
formation of mating pairs. These changes have now been studied with the 
ribonucleic acid phage MS2, and especially with the "female-specific" phage 
phiW. Several class III mutations in male and female strains were found to make 
the cells susceptible to phage phiW and to reduce their abilities to form mating 
pairs. Spontaneous phage phiW-resistant mutants isolated from class III strains 
were found also to have acquired changes in ampicillin resistance and ability to 
form mating pairs. One mutant had reverted to parental class I type in all three 
properties. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) prepared from phiW-sensitive class III 
strains inactivated the phage in vitro, whereas LPS from phage-resistant strains 
had no effect. Carbohydrate analyses of LPS preparations showed that two class 
III mutants, compared to their parental strains, had lost significant parts of 
the rhamnose, galactose, and glucose from the LPS. One of the phage 
phiW-resistant mutants showed a partial restoration of its carbohydrate 
composition. Other phiW-resistant mutants showed, instead, further losses of 
carbohydrates in their LPS. It is suggested that genes exist which 
simultaneously mediate a female-specific mating site, ampicillin resistance, and 
the receptors for phage phiW.

The selective inhibition of protein initiation by T4 phage-induced factors.

Klem EB, Hsu WT, Weiss SB.

The phenomenon of selective translation of T4 template RNA by ribosomes from 
T4-infected cells, or factors derived therefrom, has been extended to studies on 
the initiation of protein synthesis. A high-salt extract derived from 
T4-infected ribosomes inhibits the formation of initiation complexes of MS2 and 
Escherichia coli template RNA with uninfected ribosomes while efficiently 
supporting the formation of initiation complexes with T4 template RNA. T4 
factors also permit T5 template RNA to bind to E. coli ribosomes, which 
indicates that the T4 selective effect is not exclusive for T4 templates. Other 
evidence indicates that T4 factors do not alter the process of polypeptide chain 
elongation.

Host-virus interaction in ribonucleic acid bacteriophage-infected Escherichia 
coli. I. Location of "late" MS2-specific ribonucleic acid synthesis.

Haywood AM, Cramer JH, Shoemaker NL.

When actinomycin-treated, MS2-infected Escherichia coli are labeled during a 
brief period later than 16 min after infection, the newly synthesized MS2 
ribonucleic acid (RNA) appears first in the 30,000 x g sediment, probably bound 
to fragments of bacterial membranes, since the radioactivity can be released 
from the sediment with deoxycholate or urea. With longer labeling times, 
radioactivity also appears in the 30,000 x g supernatant fluid. While on the 
membrane, the RNA is organized into particles with sedimentation coefficients of 
40, 32, and 27S in the presence of low Mg(2+). In the presence of high Mg(+), 
MS2-specific RNA is found in polyribosomes. These data are interpreted to mean 
that MS2-specific RNA is synthesized and organized into larger structures on 
membrane. More than 8 min of labeling is required before radioactivity is found 
in the 81S virion which appears in the supernatant fluid.

Physical, biochemical, and immunological properties of coliphage MS-2 particles.

Rohrmann GF, Krueger RG.

H (heavy) and L (light) MS-2 particles differ in density, absorption spectrum, 
and infectivity. Studies on their sedimentation, ribonucleic acid (RNA) content 
and infectivity, appearance under the electron microscope, ribonuclease 
sensitivity, and A-protein content failed to demonstrate any difference between 
the two particle types. Studies on the size, RNA content, and density of the 
capsid and two smaller coat protein components were also conducted. The 
antigenic relatedness of five different viral and subviral particles of MS-2 
were studied by using immunodiffusion and neutralization. Capsids and the H and 
L viral particles were shown to be antigenically related, whereas the coat 
protein monomers and dimers were shown to be unrelated to the 
higher-molecular-weight particles.

The leader sequence from the 5'-terminus to the A-protein initiation codon in 
MS2-virus RNA.

De Wachter R, Vandenberghe A, Merregaert J, Contreras R, Fiers W.

RNA fragments of different chain length, each containing the 5'-terminal 
guanosine tetraphosphate (pppGp) of bacteriophage-MS2 RNA, have been isolated 
from partial ribonuclease digests of the viral RNA. The longest fragment 
overlaps with the ribosomalbinding site of the A-protein cistron. The base 
sequence has been established for the major part. The results directly confirm 
that the A-protein cistron is closest to the 5'-terminus. Its initiating (AUG) 
codon starts at position 130, being preceded by an untranslated sequence of 129 
nucleotides.

Replication of viral RNA: RNA synthetase from Escherichia coli infected with 
phage MS2 or Qb.

Feix G, Schneider MC, Weissmann C, Ochoa S.

An RNA synthetase is formed in Escherichia coli after infection with 
bacteriophages containing RNA. Specific annealing techniques revealed that, from 
the very outset of the reaction in vitro, the partially purified enzyme-template 
complex synthesizes parental-type plus strands, namely, MS2-RNA when isolated 
from cells infected with MS2 phage and Q(beta)-RNA in the case of cells infected 
with Q(beta) phage. This is in contrast to the situation found with Q(beta) 
replicase primed with Q(beta)-RNA, where the initial product is the 
complementary strand.

Serological relatedness of the ribonucleic acid-containing coliphages.

Krueger RG.

The serological relationship of the ribonucleic acid (RNA)-containing coliphages 
MS-2, M-12, R-17, f(2), beta, fr, f(4), and Qbeta was determined. Antisera 
against MS-2, R-17, f(2), fr, and Qbeta neutralized the infectivity of all of 
these RNA phages to varying degrees. Although each phage was serologically 
distinct, the antisera cross-reacted with certain phages to approximately the 
same degree, indicating the antigenic relationship of the coat proteins of these 
phages. Adsorption of anti-MS-2 sera with varying concentrations of all of the 
phages demonstrated that these viruses contain similar yet unique antigenic 
determinants. It is suggested that these RNA phages are mutants of two related 
phages rather than of the same phage.

Hung PP, Ling CM, Overby LR.

Four kinds of particles were reconstituted with RNA and protein from the 
genetically unrelated bacteriophages Qbeta and MS2, namely, two homologous and 
two heterologous, with respect to RNA and protein. However, once Qbeta RNA (or 
MS2 RNA) reacted with a few molecules of either Qbeta or MS2 protein to form a 
nucleoprotein complex (initiation complex), it formed a phagelike particle only 
with subsequent addition of the same protein.

Characterization of an infectivity assay for the ribonucleic acid of 
bacteriophage MS2.

Strauss JH Jr, Sinsheimer RL.

An infectivity assay for MS2 ribonucleic acid (RNA), which uses bacterial 
spheroplasts of an F(-) strain of Escherichia coli, has an efficiency of 10(-5) 
infected spheroplasts per RNA molecule. The characteristics of this assay and 
the influence of several parameters are presented. Important variables include 
the duration of exposure of the cells to lysozyme-ethylenediaminetetraacetic 
acid, the duration of exposure of the spheroplast stock to the RNA solutions 
before dilution, the concentration of RNA, and the presence of competing RNA. 
The growth kinetics of the virus in the infected spheroplasts and the extent of 
lysis have also been studied.

(Escherichia coli A-19) permits a distinction between the two on the basis of a 
marked difference in plaque size. They are distinct immunochemically, no 
serological cross-reaction being detectable.

Bacteriol. 92:739-745. 1966.-The ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules and coat 
proteins of two RNA coliphages, MS-2 and Qbeta, have been characterized. MS-2 
RNA shows an S(20,w) of 25.8 and a molecular weight by light scattering of 
10(6). The corresponding parameters for Qbeta-RNA were 28.9 and 0.9 x 10(6). A 
difference in base composition was reflected in the adenine-uracil ratio, which 
was 0.95 for MS-2 and 0.75 for Qbeta. The two RNA preparations are readily 
separated by chromatography on columns of methylated albumin. Both gave 
identical bouyant densities in cesium sulfate of 1.64 g/ml. The coat protein 
subunits were of similar molecular weights: 15,500 (Qbeta) and 14,000 (MS-2). 
They differed, however, in that the Qbeta-protein lacked tryptophan and 
histidine, whereas the MS-2 protein lacked only histidine.

[Study of the secondary and tertiary structure of phage MS2 RNA using nucleases 
and fluorescent dyes specific for secondary structure].

[Article in Russian]

Borisova OF, Grechko VV, Aleshkina LA, Kuznetsova NV.

The binding of ethidium bromide (EtBr) and acridine orange (AO) to RNA in native 
state or after hydrolysis by S1 and SV nucleases that specifically split 
single-stranded and double-stranded segments was studied. Nuclease S1 hydrolysis 
of RNA does not increase the number of EtBr strong binding sites, Tm and 
hyperchromic effect being also unchanged. Hydrolysis by double-stranded segments 
accessible to EtBr is followed by the diminishing of Tm and hyperchromism. A 
supposition is put forward that the main role in stabilization of the RNA 
tertiary structure is played by double-stranded segments arranged so that some 
of them are hidden and do not interact with dyes. One of the possible models may 
be parallel oriented intramolecular "hair-pins" forming compact "rod-like" 
structures.

Infectious drug resistance in E. coli isolated from livestock.

Adetosoye AI.

Escherichia coli strains isolated from clinically healthy and sick animals in 
Lagos and Oyo States of Nigeria were tested for drug resistance and distribution 
of R-factors. Fifteen multiple and 3 single (OT, S, S3) antibiotic resistance 
patterns were obtained among 333 isolates. Of the 285 resistant strains, 133 
transfered their resistant determinant to sensitive E. coli K 12 recipients in 
part or as a block. None of the donors had sex pili and they were not lysed by 
Ms2 phage. It required about 2 h for E. coli K 12 to acquire a resistance 
determinant from E. coli strains Nos. 295, 62 and 67 habouring resistance to 
oxytetracycline, streptomycin and compound of sulphonamides (S3). The number of 
recipient cells that formed transconjugants increased with the time of 
incubation.

Effect of chlorpromazine on conjugal plasmid transfer and sex pili.

Mándi Y, Molnár J.

The major tranquillizer chlorpromazine (Cpz) inhibited the conjugal transfer of 
R and F'lac plasmids. The frequency of transfer of R-144 and R-100 plasmids was 
reduced with 2-3 log by Cpz at a concentration of 50-100 microgram/ml, while the 
frequency of RM-98 plasmid did not change under the same conditions. Cpz at 100 
microgram/ml was an effective inhibitor of the transfer of F'lac plasmid. By 
means of electron microscopy and plaque assay, 100 microgram/ml Cpz was shown to 
reduce the adsorption rate of male specific ribonucleic acid phages MS-2 to the 
sides of F-pili. Common pili and flagellae seemed to be intact, but sex pili 
probably retracted in the presence of Cpz.

Changes in phage-sensitivity of Shigella flexneri strains. II. The F-like 
character of Ms2-sensitive variants.

Kerekes L, László VG, Csík M, Ludányi M, Pászti J.

Variants sensitive to male specific phage Ms2 appeared among Ms2 non-sensitive 
Shigella flexneri cultures in the course of liquid medium passages. Sensitivity 
to Ms2 was lost on acridine orange treatment and was transferable into Ms2 
non-sensitive variants. The Ms2 sensitive variants had fimbrial antigen. 
Electron microscopy showed that Ms2 phages were adsorbed on the F-like fimbriae 
of these variants. It was assumed that F-like plasmids determining F-like 
fimbrial antigen were carried by these variants.

Light-microscopic visualization of F and type 1 pili.

Biebricher CK, Düker EM.

Methods for the direct visualization of F and type 1 pili of Escherichia coli in 
the light microscope are described. The method for visualizing F pili is based 
on the specific adsorption of fluorescent dye-labelled RNA phages to F pili. The 
best results were obtained with MS2 phages labelled with rhodamine B. 
Semi-quantitative determination of the amount of F pili is possible. Type 1 pili 
can be visualized rapidly and specifically by indirect immunofluorescence. Other 
structures on the cell surface are neither detected by, nor interfere with these 
assays. By using different fluorescent dyes the two methods can be combined and 
both F and type 1 pili can be determined in the same sample.

The peculiarities of the absorption of phages T2 or MS2 on the Na-, Ca- or Al- 
forms of cherkassky montmorillonite have been studied. This depended on the size 
of the virus and the type of the exchanged cation of the mineral. The affinity 
of the phages to various forms of the montmorillonite has been defined and their 
maximum phage-sorptive activities determined.

Expression of human fibroblast interferon gene in Escherichia coli.

Derynck R, Remaut E, Saman E, Stanssens P, De Clercq E, Content J, Fiers W.

The human fibroblast interferon gene was inserted in a thermoinducible 
expression plasmid under control of the phage lambda PL promoter. The primary 
translation products predicted on the basis of the plasmid constructions were 
hybrid proteins starting with beta-lactamase or phage MS2 polymerase information 
followed by the total preinterferon. On induction, antiviral activity, whose 
physico-chemical, immunological and biological characteristics closely 
corresponded to those of authentic human fibroblast interferon, was synthesized. 
Processing to a size compatible with mature but unglycosylated authentic product 
was observed.

The binding of T4 gene 32 protein to MS2 virus RNA and transfer RNA.

Suau P, Toulmé JJ, Hélène C.

Fluorescence titrations, absorption spectroscopy and stopped-flow techniques 
were used to study the interaction of T4 coded 32-protein (P 32) with MS2 RNA 
and total tRNA from E. coli under different ionic conditions. It is shown that 
the amount of MS2 RNA and tRNA secondary structure melted by P 32 varies 
markedly and reversibly within a range of ionic conditions under which the 
binding constant of P 32 to single-stranded nucleic acids unable to form stable 
hairpins remains higher than 10(8) M-1. Kinetic experiments suggest that P 32 
dissociates from the MS2 RNA rewinding strand with a similar rate constant as 
calculated for the dissociation from single-stranded regions. Possible in vivo 
consequences of these findings are discussed.

Protein synthesis defects in temperature-sensitive mutants of Escherichia coli 
with altered ribosomal proteins.

Champney WS.

The ribosomes from four temperature-sensitive mutants of Escherichia coli have 
been examined for defects in cell-free protein synthesis. The mutants examined 
had alterations in ribosomal proteins S10, S15, or L22 (two strains). Ribosomes 
from each mutant showed a reduced activity in the translation of phage MS2 RNA 
at 44 degrees C and were more rapidly inactivated by heating at this temperature 
compared to control ribosomes. Ribosomal subunits from three of the mutants 
demonstrated a partial or complete inability to reassociate at 44 degrees C. 
70-S ribosomes from two strains showed a reducton in messenger RNA binding. tRNA 
binding to the 30 S subunit was reduced in the strains with altered 30-S 
proteins and binding to the 50 S subunit was affected in the mutants with a 
change in 50 S protein L22. The relation between ribosomal protein structure and 
function in protein synthesis in these mutants is discussed.

Protective activities of ribosomal ribonucleic acid and lipopolysaccharide of 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa: a comparative study.

Gonggrijp R, Mullers WJ, van Boven CP.

Ribosomal ribonucleic acid (RNA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from P. aeruginosa 
were compared with respect to their protective activities in mice against an 
infection with P. aeruginosa. This study is concentrated on the protective 
activity of RNA. RNA isolated from purified ribosomes did not contain LPS as 
determined with the Limulus test. Injection of RNA with the adjuvant 
dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide (DDA) protected mice against P. aeruginosa 
without inducing LPS-specific antibodies. C3H/HeJ mice which are relatively 
insensitive to the protective activity of LPS could be protected with RNA. The 
protective activities of RNA and LPS from a mutant strain of P. aeruginosa, PAC 
605, containing defective lipopolysaccharide, were compared with the protective 
activities of RNA and LPS from the parent strain, PAC IR. The protective 
activity of LPS from PAC 605 was 1000 fold lower than the protective activity of 
LPS from PAC IR. RNA preparations of both strains induced similar percentages of 
survival. The protective activity of ribosomal RNA from P. aeruginosa was 
nonspecific since mice were also protected against a heterologous serotype of P. 
aeruginosa and against Escherichia coli. RNA from ribosomes of P. aeruginosa, E. 
coli and the non-lipopolysaccharide containing Saccharomyces cerevisiae had 
similar protective activities. No protection was obtained with the ribonucleic 
acid from the E. coli phage MS2. It is concluded that ribosomal RNA has 
protective activities distinct from those of LPS.

Function of the repeating homologous sequences in nucleic acid binding domain of 
ribosomal protein S1.

Suryanarayana T, Subramanian AR.

Ribosomal protein S1 contains in its RNA binding domain four repeating, 
homologous stretches of sequences. Its functionally active mutant form m1-S1 
[Subramanian, A.R., & Mizushima, S. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 4309] contains 
only three repeating stretches. In order to assess the functional importance of 
this repeating sequence, we cleaved S1 at its reactive SH group on Cys-349 and 
isolated a fragment (S1-F4) that has lost two of the homologous stretches but 
retains all other essential elements. We find that ribosomes reconstituted with 
S1-F4 instead of S1 are functionally active in translating poly(U) and poly(A) 
but totally inactive in translating phage MS2 RNA. The significance of this 
result is discussed vis-à-vis the initiation step in translating natural mRNA, 
and a functional role for the tetrarepeat of S1 is suggested.

In this paper we discuss the constraints and combinatorial problems of folding 
long RNA and single stranded DNA molecules into base paired structures. A 
computer code FOLD-A was designed to perform base pairing foldings of very long 
sequence chains and search for low energy configurations. The logic of the 
FOLD-A algorithm is described in some detail. The applications of FOLD-A to the 
A-protein gene of MS2 and the whole genome of the phi X 174 phage with over 5300 
bases are discussed in the accompanying paper.

RNA and the whole genome of the phi X 174 phage. The folded form of the single 
stranded DNA of the phi X 174 is a six armed star with the origin of replication

High-level expression of human interferon gamma in Escherichia coli under 
control of the pL promoter of bacteriophage lambda.

Simons G, Remaut E, Allet B, Devos R, Fiers W.

Several recombinant plasmids have been constructed which direct high-level 
synthesis of mature human interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) in Escherichia coli using 
the inducible leftward promoter pL of phage lambda followed by a translational 
initiator region derived either from the phage MS2 replicase gene or the E. coli 
tryptophan attenuator region. Under these conditions, IFN levels of up to 25% of 
the total cellular protein can be achieved. The highest levels were obtained 
when a terminator of transcription was cloned downstream from the IFN-gamma 
sequence. IFN-gamma was almost entirely found in the initial pellet fraction and 
not in soluble extracts. Co-induction of the lysis genes derived from phage MS2 
or from phage lambda, inserted downstream from the IFN-gamma sequence, did not 
enhance the biological activity present in the supernatant fraction.

Effects of environmental variables and soil characteristics on virus survival in 
soil.

Hurst CJ, Gerba CP, Cech I.

Because of the increasing emphasis placed upon land application as a means of 
wastewater disposal, it is important to evaluate the influences of different 
factors upon virus survival in soil. The objective of this study was to measure 
the effects of various environmental variables on virus persistence. Test 
samples of soil were placed in vials, and the soil was wetted with suspensions 
of virus in either distilled water, unchlorinated secondary sewage effluent, or 
mixtures of effluent and water. The viruses used were coxsackieviruses A9 and 
B3, echovirus 1, poliovirus 2, rotavirus SA11, and bacteriophages T2 and MS2. 
The rate of virus inactivation was evaluated statistically with regard to 
conditions under which the vials were incubated and to the soil characteristics. 
The factors that were found to influence virus survival were temperature, soil 
moisture content, presence of aerobic microorganisms, degree of virus adsorption 
to the soil, soil levels of resin-extractable phosphorus, exchangeable 
aluminium, and soil pH. Overall, temperature and virus adsorption to soil 
appeared to be the most important factors affecting virus survival.

The translocation inhibitor tuberactinomycin binds to nucleic acids and blocks 
the in vitro assembly of 50S subunits.

Yamada T, Teshima T, Shiba T, Nierhaus KH.

Binding studies were performed with a [14C]-labelled derivative of viomycin, 
tuberactinomycin 0 (TUM O). TUM O bound to 30S and 50S subunits. The binding 
component was the RNA, since ribosomal proteins did not bind the drug. Other 
RNAs such as tRNA, phage RNA (MS2), and homopolynucleotides also bound the drug. 
Striking differences in the binding capacity of the various homopolynucleotides 
were found. Poly(U) bound strongly, poly(G) and poly(C) bound intermediately, 
whereas poly(A) showed a very low binding. DNA also bound TUM O, although with 
native DNA the binding was only weak. Finally the effects of viomycin on the 
assembly in vitro of the 50S subunit from E. coli were tested. A very strong 
inhibition was found: when the reconstitution was performed at 0.5 x 10(-6) M 
viomycin the particles formed sedimented at about 50S, but showed a residual 
activity of less than 10%. The inhibitory power of viomycin with respect to the 
in vitro assembly is more pronounced than that found in in vitro systems for 
protein synthesis.

RNase H has been used for selective cleavage of RNA of MS2 and R17 
bacteriophages and 16S RNA from E. coli ribosomes in the region of formation of 
heteroduplex composed of RNA and an oligodeoxyribonucleotide complementary to a 
certain part of it. The oligonucleotides used--d(C-T-C-A-T-G-T-T-), 
d(C-C-A-T-C-T-T-T-T) and d(T-T-T-C-C-A-T-C-T-T-T-T)--were synthesized by 
chemical methods. The molecular weight of the fragments produced on cleavage of 
the RNA of MS2 and R17 were estimated with the use of gel electrophoresis under 
denaturating conditions. The dependence of the enzyme activity on Mg2+ and Na+ 
concentration and of RNA cleavage on the RNA: oligodeoxyribonucleotide ratio was 
investigated.

[Article in Russian]

Grechko VV, Timokhina GI, Aleshkina LA.

The limited hydrolisis of bacteriophage MS2 RNA by nuclease S1 and ds-specific 
snake venom RNase was studied in a wide range of ionic strength, at different 
pH, after heating and (slow and fast) cooling and at various enzyme-substrate 
relations. It was shown that the RNA has exposed hydrolisis sites for both 
nucleases. The localizations of these sites are very specific and are not 
altered in all conditions studied. The hydrolisis rate was changed in some 
conditions, at that the fragments patterns in denaturing electrophoresis did not 
move. It was supposed that the RNA has strongly predetermined and predominant 
conformation which could not be altered by strong influences.

Cyclic AMP and its receptor protein are required for expression of transfer 
genes of conjugative plasmid F in Escherichia coli.

Kumar S, Srivastava S.

A number of cya and crp mutants of Escherichia coli HfrH were analyzed for 
several Tra functions of the F plasmid. The mutants were observed to be 
deficient in conjugal donor ability, absorption of phages MS2 and Q beta and 
surface exclusion. These defects were suppressed in cya mutants grown with cAMP 
supplementation. A cAMP concentration of 3 X 10(-4) M produced maximal 
suppression of donor ability defect in a cya strain. cAMP did not suppress the 
Tra- phenotype of crp mutants. Latent periods of MS2 were shorter in cya and crp 
bacteria. Phage T7 development appeared similar in wild type, cya, and crp 
cells. It is concluded that tra genes of F plasmid are expressed only to a small 
extent in cya and crp mutants and that cAMP and its receptor protein are 
required for the normal expression of tra genes.

Inducible high level synthesis of mature human fibroblast interferon in 
Escherichia coli.

Remaut E, Stanssens P, Fiers W.

We have obtained high level synthesis in Escherichia coli of mature human 
fibroblast interferon using a plasmid vector that was designed to allow easy 
coupling of a DNA coding region to the initiator AUG of the replicase gene of 
the RNA phage MS2 cloned downstream of phage lambda's leftward promoter. The 
activity of the promoter can be regulated by temperature. Induced cells 
accumulated the interferon up to 4% of the total cellular protein. The 
biological activity of the product amounted to 4 X 10(9) international units per 
litre of culture. The synthesis of human fibroblast interferon was shown to 
drastically inhibit the growth rate of the bacterial host.

Inactivation of hepatitis A virus and indicator organisms in water by free

Hepatitis A virus (HAV) and selected indicator organisms were mixed together in 
chlorine-demand-free buffers at pH 6, 8, or 10 and exposed to free chlorine 
residuals, and the survival kinetics of individual organisms were compared. HAV 
was enumerated by a most-probable-number dilution assay, using PLC/PRF/5 liver 
cells for propagation of the virus and radioimmunoassay for its detection. At 
all pH levels, HAV was more sensitive than Mycobacterium fortuitum, coliphage V1 
(representing a type of phage common in some sewage-polluted waters), and 
poliovirus type 2. Under certain conditions, HAV was more resistant than 
Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, coliphage MS2, and reovirus type 3. It 
was always more resistant than SA-11 rotavirus. Evidence is presented that 
conditions generally specified for the chlorine disinfection of drinking-water 
supplies will also successfully inactivate HAV and that HAV inactivation by free 
chlorine residuals can reliably be monitored by practical indicator systems 
consisting of appropriate combinations of suitable indicators such as coliform 
and acid-fast bacteria, coliphages, the standard plate count, and fecal 
streptococci.

Structure of complexes between a major protein of heterogeneous nuclear 
ribonucleoprotein particles and polyribonucleotides.

Thomas JO, Glowacka SK, Szer W.

We have investigated the structure of complexes formed between a series of 
poly(A)n (n = 30 to 480) and HD40 (helix-destabilizing protein, molecular weight 
of 40,000), the major protein component of 30 S heterogeneous nuclear 
ribonucleoprotein particles (hnRNP) from the brine shrimp Artemia salina. 
Protein HD40 is similar to corresponding hnRNP proteins from higher eukaryotes 
and the complexes it forms with single-stranded nucleic acids are strikingly 
similar to the native "beads-on-a-string" structure of hnRNP. Using analytical 
ultracentrifugation and electron microscopy we find: (1) complexes formed 
between HD40 and long ribohomopolymers also have a beads-on-a-string structure, 
showing that the ability to form this structure is an inherent property of HD40, 
and is not dependent on any structural features of natural RNA; (2) complexes 
between HD40 and poly(A)160 form disks that are about 3 nm high by 18 nm in 
diameter and contain 20 HD40 molecules; (3) complexes of HD40 with poly(A)n with 
fewer than 160 nucleotides form sectors of a disk: 40 nucleotides give rise to a 
quarter of a disk, 80 nucleotides, half a disk, etc. The molecular weights 
increase with the size of poly(A)n at the rate of 5300 per nucleotide, a 
stoichiometry of eight nucleotides per HD40; (4) as the size of the poly(A)n 
increases beyond 160 nucleotides, the additional nucleoprotein elements may 
either initiate the formation of a second disk adjacent to the first or stack on 
top of the first disk to form a 6 nm high helix with a diameter of 18 nm. Based 
on these results, we propose that the existence of lateral protein-protein 
interactions that produce the basic 3 nm X 18 nm disk, combined with the 
marginal stability of the helix result in (a) interruptions of the helix that 
give rise to the beads-on-a-string appearance of the complexes, and (b) inherent 
heterogeneity of individual "beads" which may contain one or more turns of the 
helix. From measurements of HD40 complexes with coliphage MS2 RNA, phi X174 
viral DNA as well as with the homopolymers, a bead is estimated to contain an 
average of approximately 300 nucleotides; approximately 1 X 8 turns of the 
helix.

Ghost cells as sorption matrix for virus concentration from water.

Armon R, Kott Y, Neeman I.

Pig erythrocyte membranes were used as adsorbent material for the concentration 
of bacteriophage phi x-174, MS-2, and f2 from 5 ml of saline solution. The 
adsorption was carried out at pH 3.5, and the elution was carried out at pH 7.0. 
Compared with adsorption on 3% beef extract, bacteriophage adsorption on 
erythrocyte ghost cells yielded 93 to 100%, and elution was 92 to 100%, whereas 
beef extract organic flocculation yielded adsorption of 0 to 98.8% and elution 
of 61 to 86.6%. The same procedure but with poliovirus LSC-1 gave 100% 
adsorption and 91 to 129% elution.

Bacteriophage MS2 lysis protein does not require coat protein to mediate cell 
lysis.

Coleman J, Inouye M, Atkins J.

We inserted all but the extreme 5' end of a DNA copy of the bacteriophage MS2 
lysis gene downstream of a lac-induced promoter on a multicopy plasmid. Upon 
induction, cells harboring this plasmid began to lyse, showing that phage coat 
protein is not required for the lytic process itself.

Effect of an Escherichia coli traD (ts) mutation on MS2 RNA replication.

Schoulaker-Schwarz R, Engelberg-Kulka H.

We have continued our studies on the effect of high temperature (42 degrees C) 
on the development of RNA bacteriophage MS2 in the temperature-sensitive 
conjugational transfer-deficient mutant Escherichia coli JCFL39 carrying a traD 
(ts) mutation. At 42 degrees C, mutant cells permit the penetration and 
translation of phage MS2 RNA but do not permit MS2 RNA replication. We suggest a 
role for the traD (ts) mutation in MS2 RNA replication.

Concentration of coliphage from water and sewage with charge-modified filter 
aid.

Singh SN, Gerba CP.

Methods of detecting and concentrating animal viruses from large volumes of 
water and wastewater have experienced rapid development in recent years, but 
only a few methods are available for the concentration of bacteriophages. The 
present study describes the use of a charge-modified (Zeta Plus) filter aid (AMF 
Cuno, Meriden, Conn.) for the concentration of coliphages from large volumes of 
water and sewage. Coliphages MS-2 and f2 were efficiently adsorbed from water 
and sewage to the positively charged filter aid. Elution was accomplished with 
4% beef extract--0.5 M NaCl adjusted to pH 9.5. The recovery of f2 from 10- to 
20-liter volumes of tap water ranged between 11 and 70%, and the recovery of 
MS-2 ranged between 43 and 70%. The efficiency of recovery of naturally 
occurring coliphages from secondarily treated sewage ranged between 16 and 44%. 
This technique appears to be promising because it requires low-cost equipment 
(47-mm polypropylene filter housing), is easy to handle, and can filter large 
volumes of water (greater than or equal to 20 liters) with good recoveries. 
Filtrations can be conducted at the ambient pH of the water, and the unit cost 
per filtration (i.e., the cost of filter aid) comes to less than three cents per 
sampling. The technique could be useful in evaluation of viral water quality, 
study of ecology and occurrence of phages in natural waters, and isolation of 
rare phages from natural waters.

Proteins of the 30-S subunit of Escherichia coli ribosomes which interact 
directly with natural mRNA.

Broude NE, Kussova KS, Medvedeva NI, Budowsky EI.

Ultraviolet irradiation (254 nm) of the complexes of MS2 phage RNA (mRNA) and 
the 30-S subunits of Escherichia coli ribosomes prepared at 0 degrees C and 37 
degrees C in the presence and absence of initiation factor 3 (IF-3) causes 
cross-linking of mRNA with proteins S3, S4, S5, S7, S9, S18 and IF-3. Hence, 
these proteins interact directly with mRNA within the complex 30-S-subunit . 
mRNA. Addition of IF-3 results in an increase of the rate of complex formation 
and decrease of its dissociation rate. The addition of IF-3 changes the relative 
amounts of cross-linked proteins (mainly S3, S4 and S18). Decreasing the 
temperature from 37 degrees C to 0 degrees C not only decelerates the complex 
formation rate but also changes the relative amount of cross-linked proteins, 
indicating the influence of the conditions on the structure of the complex.

Control of RNA and protein synthesis by the concentration of Trp-tRNATrp in 
Escherichia coli infected with bacteriophage MS2.

Koontz SW, Jakubowski H, Goldman E.

The effect of varying the concentration of Trp-tRNATrp in Escherichia coli 
infected with bacteriophage MS2 has been studied by varying the amount of 
exogenously added tryptophan (Trp) to cells bearing a mutation which results in 
a tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase with a higher Km value for Trp. The phenotype of 
the mutant has been confirmed by measuring the level of tRNATrp which can be 
aminoacylated in vivo, and the mutant has also been shown to have elevated 
tRNATrp levels compared to wild-type. The growth of MS2 decreases continuously 
with decreasing Trp concentration (and hence, decreasing Trp-tRNATrp 
concentration). This appears to be due to reduced gene expression, since at 
later times in infection the amount of MS2 coat protein synthesized likewise 
decreases continuously with decreasing Trp concentration. However, there is 
little decrease in the amount of coat protein or replicase synthesized during 
the first few minutes after the Trp concentration shift. A continuous increase 
in the average polysome size distribution is seen as the Trp concentration is 
decreased. MS2 RNA synthesis also decreases continuously with decreasing Trp 
concentration, and is shut off in the absence of Trp. This does not seem to be 
due to ppGpp as these cells are functionally relaxed under these conditions, nor 
does it seem to be due to degradation of pre-existing template. Addition of 
chloramphenicol abolishes the effect of Trp concentration on RNA synthesis. The 
data are consistent with a model in which ribosomes pause at Trp codons in the 
absence of Trp-tRNATrp, while other ribosomes queue behind and continue to load 
onto the message. The reduction of RNA synthesis would then be a consequence of 
coupling to translation.

Unconventional reading of the glycine codons.

Samuelsson T, Axberg T, Borén T, Lagerkvist U.

We have used a protein-synthesizing in vitro system programmed with the phage 
message MS2-RNA to investigate the ability of glycyl-tRNAs with different 
anticodons to read the glycine codons. Under conditions of no competition, when 
the glycyl-tRNA analyzed was the only source of glycine for protein synthesis, 
each of the isoacceptors tested, tRNA1Gly (anticodon CCC), tRNA2Gly (anticodon 
N/UCC), tRNA3Gly (anticodon GCC) from Escherichia coli, and tRNAGly (anticodon 
UCC) from Mycoplasma mycoides, could read all of the glycine codons in the MS2 
coat protein cistron (GGU, GGC, GGA, and GGG). However, tRNA1Gly seemed to have 
difficulties reading through the whole cistron. Experiments in which two 
glycyl-tRNAs competed for the same codon showed that the mycoplasma tRNAGly 
(anticodon UCC) was almost as efficient in the unorthodox reading of the codons 
GGU and GGC as it was in conventional reading. It would seem to be the only 
tRNAGly present in Mycoplasma mycoides and our results are consistent with this 
finding since the mycoplasma tRNAGly appears to have been designed to read all 
four glycine codons with approximately equal efficiency. The competition 
experiments furthermore showed that E. coli tRNA1Gly (anticodon CCC) reads the 
codon GGA more efficiently than it reads GGU and GGC suggesting that the mispair 
C . A between the wobble position of the anticodon and the third codon position 
might have appreciable stability.

Change in phage-sensitivity of Shigella flexneri strains. I. Changes in 
virulence and phage-sensitivity.

Kerekes L, László VG, Pászti J.

In the course of repeated passaging of virulent Shigella flexneri cultures in 
liquid media, avirulent variants and variants of reduced virulence appeared. 
They were easily recognizable by their colonial morphology. The avirulent 
variants became sensitive to certain phages not lysing the original virulent 
strains. The change of phage-sensitivity among the variants with no or decreased 
virulence was significant: chi 2 = 64.25; P less than 0.001. The amplification 
of phage-sensitivity developed in 15% of the originally avirulent cultures. No 
association was found between the loss of virulence and a specific 
phage-sensitivity pattern. In the majority of the cases sensitivity to phage Ms2 
developed during the passages, but it was observed in some of the original 
strains, too. With few exceptions, sensitivity to phage Ms2 was associated with 
the total or partial degradation of the specific antigen and the antigenic 
structure detectable by S. flexneri factor sera. These exceptions were cultures 
with maintained or decreased virulence.

The conserved 5 S rRNA complement to tRNA is not required for translation of 
natural mRNA.

Zagorska L, Van Duin J, Noller HF, Pace B, Johnson KD, Pace NR.

We have tested a putative base-paired interaction between the conserved GT psi C 
sequence of tRNA and the conserved GAAC47 sequence of 5 S ribosomal RNA by in 
vitro protein synthesis using ribosomes containing deletions in this region of 5 
S rRNA. Ribosomes reconstituted with 5 S rRNA possessing a single break between 
residues 41 and 42, deletion of residues 42-46, or deletion of residues 42-52 
were tested for their ability to translate phage MS2 RNA. Initiator tRNA 
binding, aminoacyl-tRNA binding, ppGpp synthesis, and miscoding were also 
tested. All of the measured functions could be carried out by ribosomes carrying 
the deleted 5 S rRNAs. The sizes and relative amounts of the polypeptides 
synthesized by MS2 RNA-programmed ribosomes were identical whether or not the 5 
S RNA contained deletions. Aminoacyl-tRNA binding and miscoding were essentially 
unaffected. Significant reduction in ApUpG (but not poly(A,U,G) or MS2 
RNA)-directed fMet-tRNA binding and ppGpp synthesis were observed, particularly 
in the case of the larger (residues 42-52) deletion. We conclude that if tRNA 
and 5 S rRNA interact in this fashion, it is not an obligatory step in protein 
synthesis.

[In vitro virucidal activity of antiseptics and disinfectants. I. Draft of the 
AFNOR virucidal activity standard].

[Article in French]

Garrigue G.

An antiseptic (ATS) or disinfectant (DSF) is defined as virucidal if it produces 
a 10 000-fold (4 log) or greater reduction in the number of infective units (IU) 
of three viral species (Sabin type I poliovirus, type 5 adenovirus, and vaccinia 
virus) and three E. coli bacteriophages (MS2, T2 and phi X174). and three E. 
coli bacteriophages (MS2, T2 and phi X174). Preliminary trials produce viral 
suspensions at concentrations of 10(6) to 10(9) IU/ml, and determine the 
subtoxic dilution "d" of the tested agent, susceptibility of treated cells to 
the viral infection, and antiviral activity termination dilution "D". Actual 
trials may be performed with one of three methods: simple dilution, 
dilution-ultrafiltration-reconcentration, or gel column filtration. With these 
techniques, virucidal activity can be determined after a set time of contact (15 
to 60 mn) at a given temperature (21 degrees C or 37 degrees C) by titrating the 
viral suspension after elimination or neutralization of the ATS or DSF.

Polyamine requirement for microbial protein synthesis: structural specificity in 
cell-free systems of Escherichia coli.

Praisler R, Männlein E, Aschhoff HJ, Mach M, Kersten W.

Cell-free protein synthesis was performed with synthetic or natural mRNA in an 
E. coli system containing physiological concentrations of Ca2, Mg2 and either 
one or both of the two natural polyamines of E. coli, spermidine and putrescine, 
or corresponding homologues. Putrescine does not permit poly(U)-dependent 
poly(Phe) synthesis unless spermidine or nor-spermidine is added. Spermidine 
supports homopeptide synthesis sufficiently well, its effect being stimulated by 
putrescine or homologous diamines with increasing chain length from 4 to 7 
carbon atoms. Diaminopropane completely inhibits the spermidine-activated system 
in a competitive manner. Translation of MS2 phage RNA is supported by 
putrescine, the rate and quality (read through to the termination signal) of 
translation is optimized by spermidine or triamine homologues. MS2 phage RNA 
translation is supported by spermidine, putrescine has no further stimulatory 
effect but diaminoheptane enhances the rate of translation. In this case, 
however, premature chain termination does occur. The results indicate that 
spermidine is necessary for optimal poly(U) and MS2 phage RNA translation, that 
the aminopropyl moiety is important for its function and that the remaining side 
chain can be extended from C4 to C8. Putrescine may cooperate with spermidine 
but its chain length is rather critical, it cannot substitute for spermidine. 
The results indicate that the polyamines facilitate mRNA/tRNA/ribosome 
interactions in a specific manner.

[Determination of virucidal activity. Value of the bacteriophage as a viral 
model].

[Article in French]

Lepage C, Romond C.

Virucidal activity of six disinfectants was determined in vitro against 
bacteriophages T2, MS2 and phiX 174. The preliminary study shows the 
simplifications resulting from the use of bacteriophages for this kind of test: 
easy and reproducible production of stores of bacteriophages with controlled 
purity, good stability and concentration of at least 10(7) PFU/ml, and no 
limitation due to cytotoxicity. Virucidal concentrations determined for a 
15-minute contact are 31.2 ppm (active chlorine) for hypochlorite solution, 10 
ppm (iodine) for an iodophor, 1% for formaline, 0.5% for glutaraldehyde, more 
than 0.3% for a quaternary ammonium salt and more than 3% for an amphotere. The 
proposed method gives practical information for decontamination in bio-industry. 
Given the resistance noted with bacteriophages, this experimental method could 
be applied in a more general setting.

[Study of the structural organization of RNA from phage MS2 using fluorescent 
dyes].

[Article in Russian]

Borisova OF, Grechko VV, Aleshkina LA, Kuznetsova NV.

The spatial organization of phage MS2 RNA by binding to ethidium bromide (EtBr) 
and acridine orange (AO) to RNA was studied. The analyses of dye interaction by 
spectrophotometric and fluorometric methods have demonstrated that only about a 
half of 65-70% nucleotides of double-stranded segments can interact with AO and 
EtBr. On the other hand all the single-stranded segments appear to be accessible 
to AO binding. These interactions did not practically change when ionic strength 
(0.01-0.3), Mg2+ and Zn2+ concentrations (10(-3) M) or pH (4.7-7.4) varied. The 
data permit to suppose that phage MS2 RNA has a very stable tertiary structure 
which makes part of double-stranded segments unaccessible to inter calating 
dyes. Taking these and other facts into consideration we suppose that 
double-stranded segments play an important role in stabilization of the RNA 
tertiary structure. One of the most possible structure is a compact "rod-like" 
intramolecular aggregate of double-stranded hairpin-like segments of RNA with 
parallel orientation.

Computer simulation of ribosome editing.

Menninger JR.

A stochastic model of protein synthesis was modified by including the process of 
dissociating peptidyl-tRNA from ribosomes. To simulate ribosome editing, the 
probability of dissociation was assumed to be high if the peptidyl-tRNA was 
erroneous; that is, if it resulted from transfer of a peptide to an 
aminoacyl-tRNA that was inappropriate relative to the mRNA codon. The effects of 
amino acid starvation on protein synthesis were simulated both by increasing the 
probability of such erring at and by reducing the conditional probability of 
elongation at "hungry" codons, those whose correct amino acid was in short 
supply. These probabilities were varied systematically to simulate tryptophan 
limitation during synthesis of coat protein from bacteriophage MS2. Significant 
reduction, during starvation, in the synthesis of complete coat protein required 
large reductions in the probability of elongation at hungry codons but only 
small increases in the probability of erring. Enhanced dissociation of 
peptidyl-tRNA during starvation, followed rapidly by dissociation of ribosomes 
from mRNA, led to reductions in mean polysome size, a result that had been 
interpreted by others as due to some effect of starvation on the initiation of 
protein synthesis. Results from experiments by Goldman (1982) on the cell-free 
synthesis of MS2 coat protein during tryptophan starvation could be mimicked in 
detail by the computer simulations. A simple competition between correct and 
erroneous amino acids was sufficient to explain the tryptophan dependence of 
complete coat protein and internal peptide syntheses. Values for the Michaelis 
constants were derived from the computer simulations.

Increased translational fidelity caused by the antibiotic kasugamycin and 
ribosomal ambiguity in mutants harbouring the ksgA gene.

van Buul CP, Visser W, van Knippenberg PH.

The aminoglycoside kasugamycin, which has previously been shown to inhibit 
initiation of protein biosynthesis in vitro, also affects translational accuracy 
in vitro. This is deduced from the observation that the drug decreases the 
incorporation of histidine relative to alanine into the coat protein of phage 
MS2, the gene of which is devoid of histidine codons. The read-through of the 
MS2 coat cistron, due to frameshifts in vitro, is also suppressed by the 
antibiotic. In contrast, streptomycin enhances histidine incorporation and 
read-through in this system. The effects of kasugamycin take place at 
concentrations that do not inhibit coat protein biosynthesis. 
Kasugamycin-resistant mutants (ksgA) lacking dimethylation of two adjacent 
adenosines in 16 S ribosomal RNA, show an increased leakiness of nonsense and 
frameshift mutants (in the absence of antibiotic). They are therefore 
phenotypically similar to previously described ribosomal ambiguity mutants 
(ram).

Codon specificity of starvation induced misreading.

Johnston TC, Borgia PT, Parker J.

Mistranslated derivatives of the coat protein of the bacteriophage MS2 were 
isolated from infected cells starved for asparagine. This protein contains a 
high level of lysine for asparagine substitutions. By peptide analysis and amino 
acid sequencing we show that there is a six-fold greater frequency of errors at 
AAU codons than at AAC codons. This ratio is the same as that found in unstarved 
cells where the overall error frequency is 100-fold less. We also demonstrate 
that, at least for AAC codons, context affects error frequency.

In vitro reconstitution of 35S ribonucleoprotein complexes.

Wilk HE, Angeli G, Schäfer KP.

Ribonucleoprotein complexes (hnRNP) sedimenting at 30-40 S and containing 
fragments of heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA) have been extracted from HeLa 
cell nuclei. Besides hnRNA fragments (8-12 S), the complexes contain eight 
mostly basic core proteins of Mr 31 000-41 000 as shown by two-dimensional gel 
electrophoresis. Other proteins (mostly of higher molecular weight) seem to be 
peripherally associated since they are lost after pelleting and recentrifugation 
of the hnRNP complexes. The particle dissociates into its protein components 
after digestion of the endogenous hnRNA fragments by micrococcal nuclease. After 
inactivation of the nuclease and addition of a wide variety of exogenous RNAs 
[MS2 phage RNA, poly(U), poly(C), poly(A), and poly(A,U)], a RNP particle is 
re-formed which resembles the native hnRNP complex according to its 
sedimentation value (35 S), its appearance in the electron microscope, its 
density in metrizamide, and its protein composition. No particles are formed on 
double-stranded RNA [poly(A) . poly(U)] or native DNA whereas denatured DNA 
allows complex formation. On MS2 RNA (3569 nucleotides), the formation of tri- 
and tetrameric complexes is observed. This indicates the presence of 900-1200 
nucleotides per particle. In vivo, 40S hnRNP particles are a unit component of 
larger RNP structures. Hence, we conclude from our results that the hnRNP core 
proteins have the intrinsic capability to associate with nascent single-stranded 
hnRNA regions to form these RNP complexes. Because of the lack of any sequence 
specificity, the complexes may function in packaging of the hnRNA and in 
connection with other nuclear components may provide a scaffold for subsequent 
processing reactions.

Effect of the sequences upstream from the ribosome-binding site on the yield of 
protein from the cloned gene for phage MS2 coat protein.

Kastelein RA, Berkhout B, Overbeek GP, van Duin J.

The translational efficiency of the coat protein gene of phage MS2 has been 
examined in vivo with respect to neighbouring sequences. The cloned MS2 DNA has 
been gradually shortened starting at the 5' or 3' terminus, and its effect on 
coat protein synthesis monitored. Removal of the 3'-terminal sequences had 
little influence. In contrast, the gradual removal of the 5'-terminal region 
profoundly reduces translation. Long before the ribosomal binding site (RBS) of 
the coat protein (CP) gene is reached, the yield of CP has dropped by one order 
of magnitude. Functional half-lives of the various messengers were found not to 
be significantly different. Available evidence indicates that the secondary 
structure of the RBS in native and shortened MS2 RNA is identical. We infer that 
important determinants for ribosome recognition lie 5' to the RBS region of the 
MS2 RNA coat gene.

Resolution of the discrepancy between a gene translation--termination codon and 
the deduced sequence for release of the encoded polypeptide.

Atkins JF, Gesteland RF.

The translation-termination codon of the synthetase gene of the RNA phage MS2 
has been determined, by nucleotide sequencing and suppression studies in vitro, 
to be UAG. However in one of the only two studies on the signals for polypeptide 
chain release at the end of genes, Capecchi and Klein [(1970) Nature (Lond.) 
226, 1029-1033] deduced that the synthetase of an almost identical phage, R17, 
is released at UAA. Here we show that under certain conditions the synthetase is 
released at the UAG terminator but that this UAG is especially prone to 
read-through with resulting release at the downstream UAA codon. The possible 
significance of the UAG being in a context prone to leakiness is discussed but 
is unresolved.

Preferential codon usage in prokaryotic genes: the optimal codon-anticodon 
interaction energy and the selective codon usage in efficiently expressed genes.

Grosjean H, Fiers W.

By considering the nucleotide sequence of several highly expressed coding 
regions in bacteriophage MS2 and mRNAs from Escherichia coli, it is possible to 
deduce some rules which govern the selection of the most appropriate synonymous 
codons NNU or NNC read by tRNAs having GNN, QNN or INN as anticodon. The rules 
fit with the general hypothesis that an efficient in-phase translation is 
facilitated by proper choice of degenerate codewords promoting a codon-anticodon 
interaction with intermediate strength (optimal energy) over those with very 
strong or very weak interaction energy. Moreover, codons corresponding to minor 
tRNAs are clearly avoided in these efficiently expressed genes. These 
correlations are clearcut in the normal reading frame but not in the 
corresponding frameshift sequences +1 and +2. We hypothesize that both the 
optimization of codon-anticodon interaction energy and the adaptation of the 
population to codon frequency or vice versa in highly expressed mRNAs of E. coli 
are part of a strategy that optimizes the efficiency of translation. Conversely, 
codon usage in weakly expressed genes such as repressor genes follows exactly 
the opposite rules. It may be concluded that, in addition to the need for coding 
an amino acid sequence, the energetic consideration for codon-anticodon pairing, 
as well as the adaptation of codons to the tRNA population, may have been 
important evolutionary constraints on the selection of the optimal nucleotide 
sequence.

A new set of short RNA templates has been prepared for functional studies in 
initiation of translation in vitro. Number of individual RNA fragments which 
contain complete or part of the initiatory region of phage fr replicase cistron 
were isolated from complex fr RNA--fr coat protein. Their primary structure were 
determined by using standard fingerprint technique and rapid gel sequencing. 
Secondary structure of several RNA fragments and their binding activity with 
phage fr and MS2 coat proteins has been also studied.

The regulatory region of phage fr replicase cistron. III. Initiation activity of 
specific fr RNA fragments.

Berzin V, Cielens I, Jansone I, Gren EJ.

RNA fragments from phage fr covering the complete or part of the replicase 
cistron initiation region have been used as templates in the formation of a 
ribosomal initiation complex in vitro. The results so obtained together with our 
earlier findings in a similar approach applied to fragments of the structurally 
related RNA from phage MS2 have allowed us to pinpoint the boundaries of the 
replicase cistron initiation region on phage RNA. A structural model of the 
above initiation region has been provided which shows that besides the minimal 
initiation region (comprises the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and initiator AUG), the 
flanking regions are also involved and are responsible for additional 
interactions with the ribosome. The flanking regions possibly contribute to the 
stability of specific contact between the ribosome and template realized by the 
minimal initiation region.

Mistranslation in cells infected with the bacteriophage MS2: direct evidence of 
Lys for Asn substitution.

Parker J, Johnston TC, Borgia PT.

The coat protein of the bacteriophage MS2 was found to show an increased level 
of charge heterogeneity when synthesized in Escherichia coli starved for Asn or 
Lys. No such increase was found when the host was starved for Arg, His Ile or 
Pro. This is the pattern predicted by "two-out-of-three" codon misreading in the 
coat protein gene. In the case of Asn starvation, direct measurements of the 
relative incorporation of Lys demonstrate that the observed charge heterogeneity 
is the result of mistranslation. Asn starvation increased the error frequency in 
coat protein to over 0.3 mistake per asparagine codon. The small amount of 
charge heterogeneity seen in unstarved cells seems also to be the result of 
misreading Asn codons.

Defective lysis of streptomycin-resistant escherichia coli cells infected with 
bacteriophage f2.

De Mars Cody J, Conway TW.

A lysis defect was found to account for the failure of a streptomycin-resistant 
strain of Escherichia coli to form plaques when infected with the male-specific 
bacteriophage f2. The lysis defect was associated with the mutation to 
streptomycin resistance. Large amounts of apparently normal bacteriophage 
accumulated in these cells. Cell-free extracts from both the parental and mutant 
strains synthesized a potential lysis protein in considerable amounts in 
response to formaldehyde-treated f2 RNA but not in response to untreated RNA. As 
predicted from the nucleotide sequence of the analogous MS2 phage, the protein 
synthesized in vitro had the expected molecular weight and lacked glycine. The 
cistron for the lysis protein overlapped portions of the coat and replicase 
cistrons and was translated in the +1 reading frame. Initiation at the lysis 
protein cistron may be favored by translation errors that expose the normally 
masked initiation site, and streptomycin-resistant ribosomes, known to have more 
faithful translation properties, may be unable to efficiently synthesize the 
lysis protein.

Antiviral response elicited by a completely synthetic antigen with built-in 
adjuvanticity.

Arnon R, Sela M, Parant M, Chedid L.

In a previous study we demonstrated that antiviral response against the 
coliphage MS-2 can be elicited by immunization with a synthetic antigen 
consisting of a conjugate (P2-A -- L) of a synthetic fragment (P2) of the virus 
coat protein attached to a synthetic polymeric carrier. The antiviral response 
was induced when the antigen was administered in complete Freund's adjuvant or 
when it was administered in incomplete adjuvant, provided that a peptidoglycan 
was covalently attached to it. In the present study we demonstrate the adjuvant 
effect of N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine (MDP) in this system. 
Immunization with a mixture of MDP and P2-A -- L brought about only slight 
enhancement in the titer of neutralizing antibodies, as compared to the 
immunization with P2-A -- L in saline. The best results were achieved when the 
MDP was chemically conjugated to P2-A -- L. This completely synthetic material, 
when administered in aqueous solution, yielded highly inactivating antiserum 
with a titer similar to that obtained with complete Freund's adjuvant in the 
absence of MDP. MDP-P2-A -- L elicited also a humoral immune response to MDP, 
but with much lower titer than that induced by complete Freund's adjuvant 
containing P2-A -- L only. It was also observed that the capacity of MDP-P2-A -- 
L to increase resistance against infection was more than a 100-fold greater than 
that of unconjugated MDP.

Localization of A protein in the RNA-A protein complex of RNA phage MS2.

Shiba T, Suzuki Y.

The site of interaction of phage MS2 A protein on MS2 RNA was determined by 
analysing the base sequence of the RNA fragment which was released from the 
RNAase-resistant complex prepared by RNAase digestion of RNA-A protein complex. 
The result showed that there were two types of RNA fragment: one had a sequence 
which corresponded to the sequence of the 5'-side maturation region of MS2 RNA 
and the other corresponded to the sequence of the 3'-side untranslated region. 
These results were confirmed by a competition experiment in in vitro 
reconstitution system using f2 defective RNA, lacking about 30% of the 5'-side, 
and MS2 5FUra (5-fluorouracil) RNA, lacking about 35% of the 3'-side, as 
competitors. These results seem to indicate that the A protein is bound to at 
least two sites on MS2 RNA.

Functional recognition of phage RNA by 30-S ribosomal subunits in the absence of 
initiator tRNA.

Van Duin J, Overbeek GP, Backendorf C.

30-S ribosomal subunits of Escherichia coli form a stable complex with MS2 RNA 
or Q beta RNA at 37 degrees C in the absence of initiator tRNA. The complex 
functions as a precursor of initiation since it can enter the ribosome cycle in 
the presence of inhibitors of de novo initiation.

Role of 16-S RNA in ribosome messenger recognition.

Backendorf C, Overbeek GP, Van Boom JH, Van Der Marel G, Veeneman G, Van Duin J.

The deoxyoctanuclotide (5'-3')d(A-A-G-G-A-G-G-T), which is complementary to the 
3' end of 16-S RNA, inhibits the formation of the complex between the 30-S 
subunit and MS2 RNA described in the preceding paper. If the complex is 
preformed, the octanucleotide cannot prevent entry of the complex into the 
ribosome cycle upon supplementation with the components for protein synthesis. 
The subunit . MS2-RNA complex is unable to bind the octanucleotide. It is 
concluded that in the subunit . phage-RNA initiation precursor the 16-S terminus 
is base-paired with a complementary MS2 RNA sequence. Edeine, aurintricarboxylic 
acid and antibodies against ribosomal protein S1 prevent the association of 
phage RNA with 30-S subunits. These compounds do not, however, inhibit the 
binding of (5'-3')d(A-A-G-G-A-G-G-T) to 3-S subunits. It is concluded that 
formation of the complex between MS2 RNA and 30-S subunits does not depend 
solely on the Shine and Dalgarno base-paring reaction.

Functional studies on ribosomes lacking protein L1 from mutant Escherichia coli.

Subramanian AR, Dabbs ER.

The function of protein L1 in protein biosynthesis has been examined using 
ribosomes from two independently derived mutants of Escherichia coli, both of 
which lacked this protein. In systems in vitro with phage MS2 RNA or poly(U) as 
message, the mutant ribosomes showed from 40% to 60% of the activity of 
wild-type ribosomes. The reduction in activity was apparent in the kinetics of 
[14C]phenylalanine incorporation throughout the incubation period. The 
activities were restored fully to the wild-type level by the addition of 
purified protein L1. These results show on the one hand that protein L1 is not 
essential for protein biosynthesis but, on the other, its presence can 
significantly increase the overall rate of this process. The data further 
indicate it as likely that protein L1 exerts its effect at the elongation step

[Bacteriophage MS2 mutants with disrupted phage replicase repressor activity].

[Article in Russian]

Dishler AV, Pumpen PP, Gren EIa.

A number of ts-mutants with altered characteristics of RNA synthesis in 
non-suppressor cells at elevated temperatures have been obtained after 
HNO2-treatment of phage MS2am623 (amber mutation in site 50). The mutant ts130 
is studied in detail: its peak of RNA synthesis is displaced 10 min. later and 
the total amount of RNA is reduced in 5-10 times. No RNA synthesis is observed 
in ts130-infected cell at 46 degrees C. Changes in the character of RNA 
synthesis are accompanied by the over-production of phage subunit of replicase: 
at 42 degrees C the replicase/RNA ratio in ts130 is 20 times higher than that of 
the original phage MS2am623. It is assumed that there is a decrease in the 
activity of replicase--RNA repressor complex in ts130 resulting in the loss of 
replicase control over its own synthesis while the control of coat protein 
synthesis remains unaffected.

Escherichia coli traD(Ts) mutant temperature sensitive for assembly of RNA 
bacteriophage MS2.

Schoulaker-Schwarz R, Engelberg-Kulka H.

We report here a study on the temperature-sensitive conjugational 
transfer-deficient mutant Escherichia coli JCFL39, carrying a traD(Ts) mutation, 
which is also temperature sensitive for group I RNA phages (MS2, f2, and R17). 
It is shown that, when the mutant was infected with MS2 at 42 degrees C, phage 
RNA replicated; a 27S MS2 RNA and phage proteins were synthesized. However, 
neither PFU nor physical MS2 particles were formed, showing that phage assembly 
was inhibited. In addition, the high temperature affected the membranes of the 
host mutant: the mutant was hypersensitive to chemicals, and the electrophoretic 
pattern of the membranal proteins was modified. We suggest that the pleiotropic 
effects of the traD mutation on MS2 assembly and DNA transfer during conjugation 
were a result of the changes in the membrane of the mutant.

Effects of (hydroxymethyl)trimethylpsoralen on structure and function of 
bacteriophage MS2 ribonucleic acid.

Karathanasis SK, Champney WS.

Treatment of bacteriophage MS2 with 4'-(hydroxymethyl)-4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen 
and 360-nm light caused a dose-dependent decline in the infectivity of the 
virus. Covalent photobinding of a single psoralen molecule on the phage genome 
was a lethal event. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) extracted from psoralen and 
light-treated virus had a dose-dependent 385-nm fluorescence emission but was 
unaltered in its physical properties compared to control RNA samples. Phage 
adsorption and penetration in Escherichia coli host cells were unaffected, but 
in vivo replication of the treated virus was affected to the same extent as 
infectivity. The cell-free translational activity of the MS2 RNA was also 
severely reduced after psoralen and light treatment of the phage. Examination of 
the in vitro translation products revealed that the synthesis of the viral 
replicase protein was most substantially affected. Psoralen treatment of 
purified, protein-free MS2 RNA promoted an even greater reduction in cell-free 
synthesis of all viral proteins. This difference in translational function was 
consistent with the observation that virion-free RNA bound approximately 4 times 
as much psoralen as did RNA treated within the phage capsid. It was concluded 
that the replicase gene is the most sensitive region of the viral RNA molecule 
for psoralen binding.

Principles of selective inactivation of viral genome. II. Influence of stirring 
and optical density of the layer to be irradiated upon UV-induced inactivation 
of viruses.

Budowsky EI, Kostyuk GV, Kost AA, Savin FA.

Kinetics of the UV-induced (lambda = 254 nm) inactivation of phage MS2 is 
studied for stirred and non-stirred solutions with optical densities ranging 
from 0.06 to 2.1. The extent of inactivation exhibits exponential dependence on 
irradiation time for stirred solutions thus indicating the homogeneity of the 
phage population in respect to photosensitivity of infectivity. Irradiation of 
the same solution without stirring results in deviation of survival curves from 
exponential ones (the so called "tailing"), being more pronounced the larger the 
optical density of the layer under irradiation and degree of inactivation. Such 
a deviation is conditioned by non-uniform light absorption by virions in 
solution in the absence of stirring. The inactivation kinetics upon 
UV-irradiation of the stirred and non-stirred phage solutions is rather 
accurately expressed by respective equations thus enabling the choice of 
rational conditions for a given depth of phage inactivation to be performed.

Differential stimulation by polyamines of phage RNA-directed synthesis of 
proteins.

Watanabe Y, Igarashi K, Hirose S.

The effect of polyamines on Q beta and MS2 phage RNA-directed synthesis of three 
kinds of protein in an Escherichia coli cell-free system has been studied. With 
both phage RNAs, the degree of stimulation of protein synthesis by spermidine 
was in the order RNA replicase greater than A protein, while the synthesis of 
coat protein was not stimulated significantly by spermidine. The synthesis of 
RNA replicase was stimulated by 1 mM spermidine approx. 8-fold. From the results 
of Q beta RNA direct alanyl-tRNA and seryl-tRNA binding to ribosomes and 
initiation dipeptide synthesis, it is suggested that the preferential 
stimulation of the synthesis of RNA replicase by spermidine is due at least 
partially to the stimulation of the initiation of RNA replicase synthesis.

Chemical factors influencing adsorption of bacteriophage MS2 to membrane 
filters.

Farrah SR.

Antichaotropic salts, such as magnesium sulfate, and metal chelators, such as 
citrate ions, promoted adsorption of bacteriophage MS2 to membrane filters. In 
contrast, compounds that disrupt hydrophobic interactions, such as chaotropic 
salts, urea, Tween 80, and ethanol, did not promote adsorption of MS2 to 
membrane filters and counteracted the ability of magnesium sulfate to promote 
such adsorption. These results provide evidence that magnesium sulfate promotes 
the association of MS2 with membrane filters primarily by strengthening 
hydrophobic interactions between the virus and the filters.

Polynucleotide . ribosomal-protein complexes and their decoding properties.

Sarapuu T, Villems R.

Polyadenylic acid, polycytidylic acid, polyuridylic acid or phage MS2 RNA, 
immobilized on Sepharose, form a complex with Escherichia coli ribosomal 
proteins. Regardless of their particular nucleotide composition, all four 
polynucleotides bind an invariable set of proteins consisting of S1, S3, S4, S5, 
S9, S13, L2 and L17. We found that these polynucleotide . protein complexes bind 
tRNA. Furthermore, it was possible to show that the poly(A) . protein and 
poly(U) . protein complexes select efficiently their cognate tRNAs, tRNALys and 
tRNAPhe respectively. This important functional property of the polynucleotide . 
protein complexes suggests that these ribosomal proteins belong in the ribosome 
to a functional domain responsible for the decoding of mRNA.

Concentration of bacteriophage lysates by filter chromatography.

Goyal SM, Zerda KS, Gerba CP.

High-titered phage stocks are required for carrying out genetic and 
physicochemical studies on bacteriophages. This study describes a simple method 
for the concentration of coliphages MS-2 and T2 by charge-modified filters. 
Phage lysates were first clarified by filtration through serum-coated membrane 
filters. The clarified lysate was adjusted to pH 6 and passed through a 
Zeta-plus filter (30 S size). Greater than 99% virus adsorption occurred under 
these conditions. Adsorbed viruses were successfully eluted by small volumes of 
3% beef extract (pH 10) which was subsequently neutralized with 3% beef extract 
(pH2). A concentration factor as great as 126 could be achieved by this method, 
with recoveries ranging from 54% to 97% (average = 60%).

Basepairing potential of the 3' terminus of 16S RNA: dependence on the 
functional state of the 30S subunit and the presence of protein S21.

Backendorf C, Ravensbergen CJ, Van der Plas J, van Boom JH, Veeneman G, Van Duin 
J.

The deoxyoctanucleotide 5'd (AAGGAGGT) which is complementary to the 3' terminus 
of 16S RNA has been used as a probe to measure the potential of this rRNA region 
to engage in intermolecular basepairing. The site specific binding of the 
octanucleotide is shown by labeling 16S RNA in situ at its 3' end with [32P]pCp 
and T4 RNA ligase (EC 6.5.1.3.). The label can be released as pA[32P]pCp by the 
simultaneous action of RNAse H (EC 3.1.4.34) and 5'd(AAGGAGGT). WE show that (1) 
30S subunits prepared according to standard procedures, bind less than one copy 
of 5'd(AAGGAGGT); (2) isolated 16S RNA and 30S subunits inactivated by 
transcient exposure to 0.5 mM Mg2+ do not bind the octanucleotide; (3) binding 
to inactive subunits can be restored by a brief heat treatment; (4) 30S subunits 
lacking protein S21 do not bind 5'd(AAGGAGGT) even when submitted to heat 
treatment; (5) addition of protein S21 to subunits lacking S21 restores octamer 
binding; (6) the apparent exposure of the 16S RNA 3' terminus brought about by 
protein S21 is accompanied by the potential of the subunits to accept MS2 RNA as 
messenger; (7) the presence or absence of S1 on 30S subunits has no effect on 
their octanucleotide binding property.

Concentration of coliphages from large volumes of water and wastewater.

Goyal SM, Zerda KS, Gerba CP.

Membrane filter adsorption-elution technology has been extensively used for the 
concentration and detection of animal viruses from large volumes of water. This 
study describes the development of positively charged microporous filters (Zeta 
Plus) for the concentration of coliphages from large volumes of water and 
wastewater. Four different coliphages were studied: MS-2, phi X174, T2, and T4. 
Positively charged microporous filters were found to efficiently adsorb these 
coliphages from tap water, sewage, and lake water at neutral pH. Adsorbed 
viruses were eluted with a 1:1 mixture of 8% beef extract and 1 M sodium 
chloride at pH 9. Using this method, coliphages could be concentrated from 
17-liter volumes of tap water with recoveries ranging from 34 to 100%. 
Coliphages occurring naturally in raw and secondarily treated sewage were 
recovered with average efficiencies of 56.5 and 55.0%, respectively. This method 
should be useful in isolation of rare phages, the ecology of phages in natural 
waters, and the evaluation of water quality.

A primary challenge of MS2 bacteriophage was cleared from the blood of the

challenge required an extra 3.5 days and the induction of the secondary antibody 
response was delayed, though immune memory was observed later.

Translational control of maturation-protein synthesis in phage MS2: a role for 
the kinetics of RNA folding?

Laboratories, University of Leiden, The Netherlands.

The gene for the maturation (A) protein of the single-stranded RNA coliphage MS2 
is preceded by an untranslated leader of 130 nt. Secondary structure of the 
leader was deduced by phylogenetic comparison and by probing with enzymes and 
chemicals. The RNA folds into a cloverleaf, i.e., three stem-loop structures 
enclosed by a long-distance interaction (LDI). This LDI is essential for 
translational control. Its 3'moiety contains the Shine-Dalgarno region of the 
A-protein gene, whereas its complement is located 80 nt upstream, i.e., about 30 
nt from the 5'-terminus of the RNA chain. Mutational analysis shows that this 
base pairing represses expression of the A-protein gene. We present a model in 
which translational starts can only take place on nonequilibrated RNA, in which 
base pairing between the complementary regions has not yet taken place. We 
suggest that this pairing is kinetically delayed by the intervening sequence, 
which contains the three hairpins of the cloverleaf. The model is mainly based 
on the observation that reducing the length of the intervening sequence reduces 
expression, whereas increasing the length has the opposite effect. In addition, 
further stabilization of the LDI by a stronger base pair does not lead to a 
decrease in A-protein synthesis. Such a decrease is predicted to occur if 
translation would be controlled by the equilibrium structure of the leader RNA. 
These and other observations fit a kinetic model of translational control by RNA 
folding.

Crystal structure of an RNA bacteriophage coat protein-operator complex.

Valegård K(1), Murray JB, Stockley PG, Stonehouse NJ, Liljas L.

Author information:
(1)Department of Molecular Biology, Uppsala University, Sweden.

The RNA bacteriophage MS2 is a convenient model system for the study of 
protein-RNA interactions. The MS2 coat protein achieves control of two distinct 
processes--sequence-specific RNA encapsidation and repression of replicase 
translation--by binding to an RNA stem-loop structure of 19 nucleotides 
containing the initiation codon of the replicase gene. The binding of a coat 
protein dimer to this hairpin shuts off synthesis of the viral replicase, 
switching the viral replication cycle to virion assembly rather than continued 
replication. The operator fragment alone can trigger self-assembly of the phage 
capsid at low protein concentrations and a complex of about 90 RNA operator 
fragments per protein capsid has been described. We report here the crystal 
structure at 3.0 A resolution of a complex between recombinant MS2 capsids and 
the 19-nucleotide RNA fragment. It is the first example of a structure at this 
resolution for a sequence-specific protein-RNA complex apart from the transfer 
RNA synthetase complexes. The structure shows sequence-specific interactions 
between conserved residues on the protein and RNA bases essential for binding.

We present the results of in vitro binding studies aimed at defining the key 
recognition elements on the MS2 RNA translational operator (TR) essential for 
complex formation with coat protein. We have used chemically synthesized 
operators carrying modified functional groups at defined nucleotide positions, 
which are essential for recognition by the phage coat protein. These experiments 
have been complemented with modification-binding interference assays. The 
results confirm that the complexes which form between TR and RNA-free phage 
capsids, the X-ray structure of which has recently been reported at 3.0 A, are 
identical to those which form in solution between TR and a single coat protein 
dimer. There are also effects on operator affinity which cannot be explained 
simply by the alteration of direct RNA-protein contacts and may reflect changes 
in the conformational equilibrium of the unliganded operator. The results also 
provide support for the approach of using modified oligoribonucleotides to 
investigate the details of RNA-ligand interactions.

Mutants of the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein that alter its cooperative binding 
to RNA.

80309-0215, USA.

An RNA binding assay measuring cooperative protein binding has been used to 
evaluate the effects of mutations in the MS2 phage coat protein expected to 
disrupt capsid assembly. By using the crystal structure of the virus as a guide, 
six different mutations in the FG loop structure were selected in which 
hydrophobic residues were replaced with charged residues. Most of these proteins 
form capsids in Escherichia coli, but not in an in vitro assembly assay, 
suggesting that interdimer interactions are weaker than wild type. These mutant 
proteins reduce the free energy of cooperative protein binding to a 
double-hairpin RNA from its wild-type value of -1.9 kcal/mol. Several of the 
variants that have large effects on cooperativity have no effect on RNA 
affinity, suggesting that protein-RNA interactions can be affected independently 
of dimer-dimer interactions. The V75E;A81G protein, which shows no measurable 
cooperativity, binds operator RNA equally well as the wild-type protein under a 
variety of buffer conditions. Because this protein also exhibits similar 
specificity for variant RNA sequences, it will be useful for studying RNA 
binding properties independent of capsid assembly.

Minimized virus binding for tests of barrier materials.

Lytle CD(1), Routson LB.

Author information:
(1)Division of Life Sciences, Food and Drug Administration, Rockville, Maryland 
20857, USA.

Viruses are used to test the barrier properties of materials. Binding of virus 
particles during passage through holes in the material may yield misleading test 
results. The choices of challenge virus and suspending medium may be important 
for minimizing confounding effects that might arise from such binding. In this 
study, different surrogate viruses, as well as different support media, were 
evaluated to determine optimal test parameters. Two membranes with high-binding 
properties (nitrocellulose and cationic polysulfone) were used as filters to 
compare binding activities of different surrogate challenge viruses (MS2, phi 
X174, T7, PRD1, and phi 6) in different media. The media consisted of buffered 
saline with surfactants, serum, or culture broth as additives. In addition, 
elution rates of viruses that bound to the membranes were determined. The 
results suggest that viruses can bind by hydrophobic and electrostatic 
interactions, with phi X174 displaying the lowest level of binding by either 
process. The nonionic detergents Triton X-100 and Tween 80 (0.1%) equally 
minimized hydrophobic interactions. Neither anionic nor cationic surfactants 
were as effective at nontoxic levels. Serum was effective at reducing both 
hydrophobic and electrostatic binding, with 2% being sufficient for eliminating 
binding under our test conditions. Thus, phi X174 remains the best choice as a 
surrogate virus to test barrier materials, and Triton X-100 (0.1%) remains a 
good choice for reducing hydrophobic binding. In addition, binding of viruses by 
barrier materials is unlikely to prevent passage of blood-borne pathogens.

A new factor from Escherichia coli affects translocation of mRNA.

Ganoza MC(1), Cunningham C, Green RM.

Author information:
(1)Banting and Best Department of Medical Research, University of Toronto, 
Ontario, Canada.

Reconstitution of protein synthesis from purified translation factors on 
ribosomes from Escherichia coli has revealed the requirement for a protein, W, 
that affects chain elongation and is essential to reconstitute the process 
(Ganoza, M. C., Cunningham, C., and Green, R. M. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 
U.S.A. 82, 1648-1652). We report that W has no effect on initiation complex 
formation by 30 or 70 S ribosomes or on the association of ribosomal subunits, 
peptide bond synthesis, or binding Ala-tRNA, which is the second amino acid of 
the coat protein of the MS2 RNA virion. W has a pronounced effect on tripeptide 
synthesis, and is obligatory for the synthesis of the coat protein or of the 
hexapeptide encoded by f2am3 RNA. Extracts from a temperature-sensitive mutant 
of the translocase, EF-G, were purified free of the W protein and were used to 
score for translocation defects. W is required for binding Ser-tRNA, the third 
N-terminal amino acid of the MS2 or f2 RNA coat protein to ribosomes bearing 
fMet-Ala-tRNA, as well as for the ejection of deacyl-tRNA from ribosomes, which 
occurred concomitant with the binding of the Ser-tRNA. We propose that W 
functions by ejecting tRNAs from ribosomes in a step that precedes the movement 
of mRNA during translocation.

The coat protein from the MS2 bacteriophage plays a dual role by encapsidating 
viral RNA and also by binding RNA as a translational repressor. In order to 
study the isolated dimer in a conformation not influenced by capsid 
interactions, a mutant molecule was crystallized that is defective in capsid 
assembly but is an active repressor. The unassembled dimer crystallized in the 
space group P21212 with a = 76.2, b = 55.7, and c = 28.4 A. In these crystals, 
monomers were related by twofold symmetry. When this dimer was co-crystallized 
with 5-bromouridine, crystals formed in space group R3 with a = b = 155.9 A, c = 
29.9 A, gamma = 120 degrees; the dimer was the asymmetric unit.

Multiple presentation of foreign peptides on the surface of an RNA-free 
spherical bacteriophage capsid.

Author information:
(1)Department of Genetics, University of Leeds, U.K.

We have produced a plasmid expression vector for the coat protein of RNA 
bacteriophage MS2. The vector has been modified to introduce a unique KpnI 
restriction site within the coat protein gene at a site corresponding to the 
most radially distant feature of the bacteriophage capsid, namely the top of the 
N-terminal beta-hairpin (between residues 15 and 16). Insertion of DNA 
oligonucleotides at this site allows the production of chimeric MS2 coat 
proteins having foreign peptide sequences expressed as the central part of the 
hairpin. We have produced chimeras with a number of different peptide sequences 
(up to 24 amino acids in length) chosen because of their known antigenic 
properties. The chimeric coat proteins self-assemble into largely RNA-free 
phage-like capsids in Escherichia coli and can be easily disassembled and 
reassembled in vitro. Such peptide-presenting particles may have a number of 
biotechnological applications, including use as a cost-effective, synthetic 
vaccine. We have tested the antigenicity of one such construct in vivo in mice 
and have shown that these particles are immunogenic and that antibody titres 
against the inserted peptide epitope can be obtained.

Coevolution of RNA helix stability and Shine-Dalgarno complementarity in a 
translational start region.

Olsthoorn RC(1), Zoog S, van Duin J.

Author information:
(1)Department of Biochemistry, Leiden Institute of Chemistry, Gorlaeus 
Laboratories, University of Leiden, The Netherlands.

The initiation region of the coat-protein gene of RNA bacteriophage MS2 adopts a 
well-defined hairpin structure with the start codon occupying the loop position, 
while the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence is part of the stem. In a previous study, 
we introduced mutations in this hairpin that changed its thermodynamic 
stability. The resulting phages evolved to regain the wild-type stability by 
second-site compensatory substitutions. Neither the original nor the suppressor 
mutations were in the SD region. In the present analysis, we have made changes 
in the SD region that shorten or extend its complementarity to the 3' end of 16S 
rRNA and monitored their evolution to a stable pseudorevertant species. Phages 
in which the SD complementarity was decreased evolved an initiator hairpin of 
lower stability than wild type while those in which the complementarity was 
extended evolved a hairpin with an increased stability. We conclude that weaker 
SD sequences still allow maximal translation if the secondary structure of the 
ribosome-landing site is destabilized accordingly. Alternatively, 
translation-initiation regions with a stronger secondary structure still allow 
maximal expression, if the SD complementarity is extended. These findings 
support a previously published model in which the SD interaction helps the 
ribosome to melt the structure in a translation-initiation region.

Effect of testing method on apparent activities of antiviral disinfectants and 
antiseptics.

Woolwine JD(1), Gerberding JL.

Author information:
(1)Department of Medicine, University of California at San Francisco, USA.

This study was designed to evaluate the independent effects of various test 
methods on the activities of antiviral chemical germicides. The activities of 
germicides against MS2 and phi 6 bacteriophages in a new porcine tissue carrier 
model were compared to those obtained by four other methods (suspension, glass 
carrier, tile carrier, and fingerpad tissue carrier tests). After a 1-min 
contact followed by neutralization (and elution off the carriers), the residual 
virus in the treated samples was quantified and the amount was compared with 
that in the saline controls. Antiviral activity was highly dependent on the test 
method for both viruses and was always greatest in suspension tests and lowest 
in tissue carrier tests. Results obtained for hydrophilic MS2 with the porcine 
tissue carrier were comparable to those from fingerpads, but lipophilic phi 6 
was subject to spontaneous inactivation on human skin and proved unsuitable for 
fingerpad testing. These data indicate that the activities of germicides in 
tests with nonbiological substrates may overestimate antiviral antiseptic 
activity on skin surfaces. Products intended for use as antiviral antiseptics or 
hand-washing agents should be evaluated in a tissue carrier system. The porcine 
tissue carrier model provides a safe, inexpensive, accurate, and reproducible 
method for testing the activities of antiseptics.

Crystal structure of the MS2 coat protein dimer: implications for RNA binding 
and virus assembly.

Ni CZ(1), Syed R, Kodandapani R, Wickersham J, Peabody DS, Ely KR.

Author information:
(1)Cancer Research Center, La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation, CA 92037, USA.

BACKGROUND: The coat protein in RNA bacteriophages binds and encapsidates viral 
RNA, and also acts as translational repressor of viral replicase by binding to 
an RNA hairpin in the RNA genome. Because of its dual function, the MS2 coat 
protein is an interesting candidate for structural studies of protein-RNA 
interactions and protein-protein interactions. In this study, unassembled MS2 
coat protein dimers were selected to analyze repressor activity and virus 
assembly.
RESULTS: The crystal structure of a mutant MS2 coat protein that is defective in 
viral assembly yet retains repressor activity has been determined at 2.0 A 
resolution. The unassembled dimer is stabilized by interdigitation of 
alpha-helices, and the formation of a 10-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet across 
the interface between monomers. The substitution of arginine for tryptophan at 
residue 82 results in the formation of two new inter-subunit hydrogen bonds that 
further stabilize the dimer. Residues that influence RNA recognition, identified 
by molecular genetics, were located across the beta-sheet. Two of these residues 
(Tyr85 and Asn87) are displaced in the unliganded dimer and are located in the 
same beta-strand as the Trp-->Arg mutation.
CONCLUSIONS: When compared with the structure of the coat protein in the 
assembled virus, differences in orientation of residues 85 and 87 suggest 
conformational adjustment on binding RNA in the first step of viral assembly. 
The substitution at residue 82 may affect virus assembly by imposing 
conformational restriction on the loop that makes critical inter-subunit 
contacts in the capsid.

Nucleotide sequence of a single-stranded RNA phage from Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 
kinship to coliphages and conservation of regulatory RNA structures.

University, The Netherlands.

We report the complete nucleotide sequence of the single-stranded RNA phage PP7 
from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. There are three open reading frames which code for 
apparent protein homologues of the single-stranded RNA coliphages, i.e., 
maturation protein, coat protein, and replicase. A fourth overlapping reading 
frame exists that probably encodes a lysis protein, similar to what has been 
found in the group A coliphages such as MS2. The genetic map of PP7 is colinear 
with group A coliphages and we accordingly classify the phage as a levivirus. 
There is, generally speaking, no significant nucleotide sequence identity 
between PP7 and the coliphages except for a few regions where homologous parts 
of proteins are encoded, most notable in the replicase gene. In these regions 
the nucleotide sequence similarity between PP7 and MS2 is no greater than 
between PP7 and the group B coliphages such as Q beta. Surprisingly, Q beta and 
MS2 are no closer to each other than they are to PP7. Several regulatory RNA 
secondary structure features that are present in the coliphages were identified 
also in PP7 RNA although the sequences involved cannot be aligned. Among these 
are the coat protein binding helix at the start of the replicase gene, 
structures at the 5' and 3' terminus of the RNA, a replicase binding site, and 
the structure of the coat protein cistron start. Some of these features resemble 
MS2 type coliphages but others the Q beta type. These findings suggest that PP7 
is related to the coliphages but branched off before the coliphages diverged 
into separate groups.

Preliminary study of test methods to assess the virucidal activity of skin 
disinfectants using poliovirus and bacteriophages.

Davies JG(1), Babb JR, Bradley CR, Ayliffe GA.

Author information:
(1)Hospital Infection Research Laboratory, Dudley Road Hospital, Birmingham, UK.

Two tests for assessing the virucidal activity of antiseptics are proposed. 
These involve applying either poliovirus (vaccine strain Sabin 1 an) or 
Escherichia coli bacteriophage (MS2 or K1-5) to the fingertips. Both test 
viruses are considered safe although poliovirus may be unacceptably tolerant to 
antiseptics. The use of bacteriophages as test organisms precludes the need for 
sophisticated recovery systems and can be undertaken readily by any bacteriology 
laboratory. The virucidal activity of 70%, 80% and 90% ethanol, 7.5% 
povidone-iodine, and soap and water was assessed using these tests. Thorough 
cleansing, followed by disinfection with 90% ethanol, was the most effective 
treatment. Removal of viruses from the gloved hand was also assessed and this 
was found to be more easily achieved than cleaning and disinfecting the ungloved 
hand. Wearing gloves protects the hands from viral contamination but changing 
them after each patient or contact is expensive.

The effectiveness of a newly developed anti-cross contamination device for a 
dental air-turbine handpiece was tested. The handpiece with or without the 
anti-cross contamination device was contaminated with two bacterial strains, 
Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus mutans, as well as two bacteriophage 
strains, T2 and MS2. After contamination with these microorganisms, the 
handpieces were disinfected with glutaraldehyde or replaced with newly 
autoclaved ones. Residual microorganisms inside the handpiece or an air/water 
supply hose line were collected and counted after overnight cultivation. The 
anti-cross contamination device effectively reduced the contamination level of 
an air-turbine handpiece to that of the negative control. No microbial 
contamination in the air/water supply hose line was detected with this device.

Translational initiation at the coat-protein gene of phage MS2: native upstream 
RNA relieves inhibition by local secondary structure.

de Smit MH(1), van Duin J.

Author information:
(1)Department of Biochemistry, Gorlaeus Laboratories, University of Leiden, The 
Netherlands.

Maximal translation of the coat-protein gene from RNA bacteriophage MS2 requires 
a contiguous stretch of native MS2 RNA that extends hundreds of nucleotides 
upstream from the translational start site. Deletion of these upstream sequences 
from MS2 cDNA plasmids results in a 30-fold reduction of translational 
efficiency. By site-directed mutagenesis, we show that this low level of 
expression is caused by a hairpin structure centred around the initiation codon. 
When this hairpin is destabilized by the introduction of mismatches, expression 
from the truncated messenger increases 20-fold to almost the level of the 
full-length construct. Thus, the translational effect of hundreds of upstream 
nucleotides can be mimicked by a single substitution that destabilizes the 
structure. The same hairpin is also present in full-length MS2 RNA, but there it 
does not impair ribosome binding. Apparently, the upstream RNA somehow reduces 
the inhibitory effect of the structure on translational initiation. The upstream 
MS2 sequence does not stimulate translation when cloned in front of another 
gene, nor can unrelated RNA segments activate the coat-protein gene. Several 
possible mechanisms for the activation are discussed and a function in gene 
regulation of the phage is suggested.

Mutations that increase the affinity of a translational repressor for RNA.

Lim F(1), Peabody DS.

Albuquerque 87131.

The coat protein of the RNA bacteriophage MS2 is a specific RNA binding protein 
that represses translation of the viral replicase gene during the infection 
cycle. As an approach to characterizing the RNA-binding site of coat protein we 
have isolated a series of coat mutants that suppress the effects of a mutation 
in the translational operator. Each of the mutants exhibits a super-repressor 
phenotype, more tightly repressing both the mutant and wild-type operators than 
does the wild-type protein. The variant coat proteins were purified and 
subjected to filter binding assays to determine their affinities for the mutant 
and wild-type operators. Each protein binds the operators from 3 to 7.5-fold 
more tightly than normal coat protein. The amino acid substitutions seem to 
extend the normal binding site by introducing new interactions with RNA.

Control of translation by mRNA secondary structure in Escherichia coli. A 
quantitative analysis of literature data.

de Smit MH(1), van Duin J.

Author information:
(1)Leiden Institute of Chemistry, Gorlaeus Laboratories, Leiden University, The 
Netherlands.

Translational efficiency in Escherichia coli is strongly controlled by the 
secondary structure of the mRNA in the translational initiation region. We have 
previously shown that protein production from the coat-protein gene of RNA 
bacteriophage MS2 is directly related to the fraction of mRNA molecules in which 
the ribosome binding site is unfolded. This fraction is dictated by the free 
energy (delta Gf0) of the local secondary structure. We now present a similar 
analysis of published data on four other ribosome binding sites. The results 
conform quantitatively to the same relationship as found for the MS2 
coat-protein gene. The efficiency of translation is determined by the overall 
stability of the structure at the ribosome binding site, whether the initiation 
codon itself is base-paired or not. Structures weaker than -6 kcal/mol usually 
do not reduce translational efficiency. Below this threshold, all systems show a 
tenfold decrease in expression for every -1.4 kcal/mol, as predicted from 
theory.

Crystal structure of bacteriophage fr capsids at 3.5 A resolution.

The structure of recombinant capsids of the bacterial virus fr has been 
determined by X-ray crystallography at 3.5 A resolution. The capsids were 
produced by expressing the fr coat protein in Escherichia coli, the natural host 
of the virus, and are probably essentially identical to the protein shell of the 
native virus. The structure was determined using molecular replacement with the 
protein shell of the related MS2 virus, and refined to a crystallographic 
R-factor of 0.228. A comparison of the protein shells of the viruses shows that 
they are very similar, and indicates that they may have a similar regulation of 
the assembly of the quasi-symmetrical protein shell.

Leeway and constraints in the forced evolution of a regulatory RNA helix.

Olsthoorn RC(1), Licis N, van Duin J.

Author information:
(1)Department of Biochemistry, Leiden University, Gorlaeus Laboratories, The 
Netherlands.

The start of the coat protein gene of RNA phage MS2 adopts a well-defined 
hairpin structure of 12 bp (including one mismatch) in which the start codon 
occupies the loop position. An earlier expression study using partial MS2 cDNA 
clones had indicated that the stability of this hairpin is important for gene 
expression. For every -1.4 kcal/mol increase in stability a 10-fold reduction in 
coat protein was obtained. Destabilizations beyond the wild-type value did not 
affect expression. These results suggested that the hairpin was tuned in the 
sense that it has the highest stability still compatible with maximal ribosome 
loading. Employing an infectious MS2 cDNA clone, we have now tested the 
prediction that the delta G 0 of the coat protein initiator helix is set at a 
precise value. We have introduced stabilizing and destabilizing mutations into 
this hairpin in the intact phage and monitored their evolution to viable 
species. By compensatory mutations, both types of mutants quickly revert along 
various pathways to wild-type stability, but not to wild-type sequence. As a 
rule the second-site mutations do not change the encoded amino acids or the 
Shine-Dalgarno sequence. The return of too strong hairpins to wild-type 
stability can be understood from the need to produce adequate supplies of coat 
protein. The return of unstable hairpins to wild-type stability is not 
self-evident and is presently not understood. The revertants provide an 
evolutionary landscape of slightly suboptimal phages, that were stable at least 
for the duration of the experiment (approximately 20 infection cycles).(ABSTRACT

OBJECTIVES: to determine and compare the microbial retention efficiency of 3 
types of heat and moisture exchange (HME) filters.
DESIGN: randomised prospective study.
SETTING: Intensive Care Unit at the Middlesex Hospital and the microbiology 
laboratory of the Department of Academic Microbiology, University College London 
Medical School.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: An aerosol challenge to each filter using a suspension 
containing. S. marcescens and the bacteriophage MS2. In total 45 filters of 3 
types were tested, 15 previously unused and 30 that had been used in ventilator 
circuits of 30 patients. The 3 types of filter generally had microbial retention 
efficiencies of > 99.99% for both S. marcescens and the bacteriophage MS2.
CONCLUSION: The 3 types of HME filter were effective microbial filters and 
comparable in their microbial retention.

The role of DNA damage in PM2 viral inactivation by methylene blue 
photosensitization.

Specht KG(1).

Author information:
(1)American Red Cross, Northwest Ohio Blood Services, Bowling Green.

This study investigates the importance of DNA damage in viral inactivation by 
phenothiazines and light. Phenothiazines, including methylene blue (MB), 
toluidine blue and azure B are of particular interest because of their ability 
to bind to nucleic acids in vitro. Initial studies employing phages T7, MS2 and 
PM2 indicated that both DNA and RNA phages as well as enveloped and nonenveloped 
phages can be inactivated by phenothiazine photosensitization. PM2, which 
contains a lipid-protein bilayer and supercoiled DNA, was used for the 
mechanistic studies to model blood-borne viruses. Viral DNA damage was assessed 
following treatment of phage to known levels of viral inactivation by extracting 
the DNA and analyzing for both direct and piperidine-catalyzed strand cleavage 
by gel electrophoresis. DNA strand cleavage was found to be both sensitizer 
concentration and light dose dependent. Both viral inactivation and DNA damage 
were found to be oxygen-dependent events. In parallel experiments, strand 
cleavage of isolated PM2 DNA treated with MB and light was also found to be 
oxygen dependent, in contrast to some previous reports. Transfection studies, 
which measure the infectivity of the extracted viral DNA, indicated that DNA 
from MB-treated phage was just as capable of generating progeny virus as the 
untreated controls. It was therefore concluded that the observed DNA damage is 
not correlated with loss of phage infectivity.

A continuous cell-free protein synthesis system of an extremely thermophilic 
eubacterium, Thermus thermophilus HB27, was constructed. This system produced 
MS2 phage RNA translation products at a rate of more than 5 micrograms per hour 
per 1.9 mg of ribosomes at 65 degrees C and the production continued linearly 
for at least 340 min. When no polyamine was added, the system did not produce 
the proteins. The highest activity was recorded when 0.1 mM 
tetrakis(3-aminopropyl)ammonium and 1.0 mM spermine were added simultaneously.

Altering the RNA binding specificity of a translational repressor.

The coat proteins of RNA phages MS2 and GA are specific RNA-binding proteins 
which function to encapsidate viral RNA and to translationally repress synthesis 
of the viral replicase. The two proteins have highly homologous amino acid 
sequences, yet they show different RNA binding specificities, recognizing RNA 
stem-loop structures which differ primarily in the nucleotide sequences of their 
loops. We sought to convert MS2 coat protein to the RNA binding specificity of 
GA through the introduction of GA-like amino acid substitutions into the MS2 
coat protein RNA-binding site. The effects of the mutations were determined by 
measuring the affinity of the coat protein variants for RNA in vitro and by 
measuring translational repression in vivo. We found five substitutions that 
affect RNA binding. One dramatically reduces binding of MS2 coat protein to both 
operators. Three others compensate for this defect by nonspecifically 
strengthening the interaction. Another substitution accounts for the ability to 
recognize the differences in the RNA loop sequence.

Encapsidation of heterologous RNAs by bacteriophage MS2 coat protein.

Pickett GG(1), Peabody DS.

Author information:
(1)Department of Cell Biology, University of New Mexico, School of Medicine and 
Cancer Center, Albuquerque 87131.

The RNA bacteriophages of E. coli specifically encapsidate a single copy of the 
viral genome in a protein shell composed mainly of 180 molecules of coat 
protein. Coat protein is also a translational repressor and shuts off viral 
replicase synthesis by interaction with a RNA stem-loop containing the replicase 
initiation codon. We wondered whether the translational operator also serves as 
the viral pac site, the signal which mediates the exclusive encapsidation of 
viral RNA by its interaction with coat protein. To test this idea we measured 
the ability of lacZ RNA fused to the translational operator to be incorporated 
into virus-like particles formed from coat protein expressed from a plasmid. The 
results indicate that the operator-lacZ RNA is indeed encapsidated and that 
nucleotide substitutions in the translational operator which reduce the 
tightness of the coat protein-operator interaction also reduce or abolish 
encapsidation of the hybrid RNA. When coat protein is expressed in excess 
compared to the operator-lacZ RNA, host RNAs are packaged as well. However, 
elevation of the level of operator-lacZ RNA relative to coat protein results in 
its selective encapsidation at the expense of cellular RNAs. Our results are 
consistent with the proposition that this single protein-RNA interaction 
accounts both for translational repression and viral genome encapsidation.

Effects of amino acid substitution on the thermal stability of MS2 capsids 
lacking genomic RNA.

Stonehouse NJ(1), Stockley PG.

(1)Department of Genetics, University of Leeds, UK.

The thermal stability of capsids of the bacteriophage MS2, lacking genomic RNA, 
has been investigated using electron microscopy. Coat protein mutants with amino 
acid substitutions at residues involved in making contracts at both 
inter-molecular interfaces and within the coat protein submit are also capable 
of forming 'empty' capsids of the same size and symmetry as the wild-type 
protein. Mutations have been characterised which are neutral, deleterious or 
advantageous in terms of thermal stability. In some cases, the results can be 
rationalised by reference to the recently refined X-ray crystal structure of the 
wild-type particle.

The refined structure of bacteriophage MS2 at 2.8 A resolution.

Golmohammadi R(1), Valegård K, Fridborg K, Liljas L.

Author information:
(1)Department of Molecular Biology, Uppsala University Uppsala Biomedical 
Centre, Sweden.

Bacteriophage MS2 is an icosahedral virus with 180 copies of a coat protein 
forming a shell around a single-stranded RNA molecule. The coat protein subunits 
form a lattice with the triangulation number T = 3. The coat protein has a fold 
which is different from the fold of all other viral coat proteins so far known. 
It consists of a five-stranded beta sheet facing the inside of the particle, and 
a hairpin and two helices on the outside. The crystal structure has been refined 
at 2.8 A resolution. The final R-factor was 0.189 for reflections with F > 2 
sigma, and the root-mean-square deviation from idealized bond lengths and bond 
angles was 0.015 A and 2.9 degrees, respectively. The three chemically identical 
conformers A, B and C are largely similar. The B conformer has a unique 
conformation in one loop, which is involved in 5-fold interactions, while the A 
and C conformers, which are involved in the quasi-6-fold contacts, are similar 
throughout the structure. One cis-proline has been identified in the B conformer 
but the corresponding prolines in A and C are of the trans isomer. This residue 
is conserved within small RNA coliphages and it is proposed that this 
isomerization enables a less elongated loop (FG) around the 5-fold axis, thus 
creating a channel. The extensive dimer contact supports the idea of dimers as 
initial building blocks. An assembly pathway is proposed where five dimers 
converge into a pentamer and 12 pentamers are linked together with free dimers 
creating a complete particle.

Polyamines modulate streptomycin-induced mistranslation in Escherichia coli.

Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, University of Buenos Aires, Argentina.

The effects of intracellular levels of polyamines on both the in vivo inhibition 
of protein synthesis and the decrease of translation accuracy induced by 
streptomycin have been studied in polyamine-auxotrophic strains of Escherichia 
coli infected with the MS2 bacteriophage. The amount of viral coat protein 
formed was strongly reduced upon addition of increasing concentrations of 
streptomycin to polyamine-supplemented bacteria. In contrast, the antibiotic 
almost did not inhibit coat protein synthesis in polyamine-starved cells. The 
increase of mistranslation frequency elicited by streptomycin was only observed 
in bacteria grown with putrescine. In these cells several coat 
protein-satellites were detected after two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. 
These proteins, more basic than the normal MS2 coat protein, contain multiple 
substitutions of lysine for asparagine.

Translational initiation on structured messengers. Another role for the 
Shine-Dalgarno interaction.

de Smit MH(1), van Duin J.

Author information:
(1)Department of Biochemistry, Gorlaeus Laboratories, University of Leiden, The 
Netherlands.

Translational efficiency in Escherichia coli is in part determined by the 
Shine-Dalgarno (SD) interaction, i.e. the base-pairing of the 3' end of 16S 
ribosomal RNA to a stretch of complementary nucleotides in the messenger, 
located just upstream of the initiation codon. Although a large number of 
mutations in SD sequences have been produced and analysed, it has so far not 
been possible to find a clear-cut quantitative relationship between the extent 
of the complementarity to the rRNA and translational efficiency. This is 
presumably due to a lack of information about the secondary structures of the 
messengers used, before and after mutagenesis. Such information is crucial, 
because intrastrand base-pairing of a ribosome binding site can have a profound 
influence on its translational efficiency. By site-directed mutagenesis, we have 
varied the extent of the SD complementarity in the coat-protein gene of 
bacteriophage MS2. The ribosome binding site of this gene is known to adopt a 
simple hairpin structure. Substitutions in the SD region were combined with 
other mutations, which altered the stability of the structure in a predictable 
way. We find that mutations reducing the SD complementarity by one or two 
nucleotides diminish translational efficiency only if ribosome binding is 
impaired by the structure of the messenger. In the absence of an inhibitory 
structure, these mutations have no effect. In other words, a strong SD 
interaction can compensate for a structured initiation region. This can be 
understood by considering translational initiation on a structured ribosome 
binding site as a competition between intramolecular base-pairing of the 
messenger and binding to a 30 S ribosomal subunit. A good SD complementarity 
provides the ribosome with an increased affinity for its binding site, and 
thereby enhances its ability to compete against the secondary structure. This 
function of the SD interaction closely parallels the RNA-unfolding capacity of 
ribosomal protein S1. By comparing the expression data from mutant and wild-type 
SD sequences, we have estimated the relative contribution of the SD base-pairs 
to ribosome-mRNA affinity. Quantitatively, this contribution corresponds quite 
well with the theoretical base-pairing stabilities of the wild-type and mutant 
SD interactions.

The RNA binding site of bacteriophage MS2 coat protein.

Peabody DS(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Cell Biology, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, 
Albuquerque 87131.

The coat protein of the RNA bacteriophage MS2 binds a specific stem-loop 
structure in viral RNA to accomplish encapsidation of the genome and 
translational repression of replicase synthesis. In order to identify the 
structural components of coat protein required for its RNA binding function, a 
series of repressor-defective mutants has been isolated. To ensure that the 
repressor defects were due to substitution of binding site residues, the mutant 
coat proteins were screened for retention of the ability to form virus-like 
particles. Since virus assembly presumably requires native structure, this 
approach eliminated mutants whose repressor defects were secondary consequences 
of protein folding or stability defects. Each of the variant coat proteins was 
purified and its ability to bind operator RNA in vitro was measured. DNA 
sequence analysis identified the nucleotide and amino acid substitutions 
responsible for reduced RNA binding affinity. Localization of the substituted 
sites in the three-dimensional structure of coat protein reveals that amino acid 
residues on three adjacent strands of the coat protein beta-sheet are required 
for translational repression and RNA binding. The sidechains of the affected 
residues form a contiguous patch on the interior surface of the viral coat.

[mRNA with an extended Shine-Dalgarno sequence is translated independently of 
ribosomal protein S1].

[Article in Russian]

Balakin AG, Bogdanova SL, Skripkin EA.

The role of the ribosomal protein S1 in translation of a mRNA containing an 
extended Shine-Dalgarno sequence has been investigated. Using the toe printing 
technique, the formation of a ternary initiation complex with both S1-depleted 
30S subunits and subunits treated with anti-S1 antibodies and mini-mRNA 
containing an lambda-cro-mRNA translational initiation region with a very long 
(9 nucleotides) Shine-Dalgarno sequence, has been demonstrated. It is concluded 
that initiation of translation on mRNA with extended SD-sequence is 
S1-independent. By means of an E. coli cell-free system of translation (S-100 
extract), the translation of mini-cro-mRNA by S1-depleted ribosomes has been 
shown. In contrast with mini-cro-mRNA, the 30S subunits without protein S1 are 
inactive both in the ternary initiation complex formation and in cell-free 
translation with MS2 or fr phage RNAs and RNA protein III of phage fd.

Random removal of inserts from an RNA genome: selection against single-stranded 
RNA.

Olsthoorn RC(1), van Duin J.

Author information:
(1)Gorlaeus Laboratories, Department of Biochemistry, Leiden Institute of 
Chemistry, University of Leiden, The Netherlands.

We have monitored the evolution of insertions in two MS2 RNA regions of known 
secondary structure where coding pressure is negligible or absent. Base changes 
and shortening of the inserts proceed until the excessive nucleotides can be 
accommodated in the original structure. The stems of hairpins can be 
dramatically extended but the loops cannot, revealing natural selection against 
single-stranded RNA. The 3' end of the MS2 A-protein gene forms a small hairpin 
with an XbaI sequence in the loop. This site was used to insert XbaI fragments 
of various sizes. Phages produced by these MS2 cDNA clones were not wild type, 
nor had they retained the full insert. Instead, every revertant phage had 
trimmed the insert in a different way to leave a four- to seven-membered loop to 
the now extended stem. Similar results were obtained with inserts in the 5' 
untranslated region. The great number of different revertants obtained from a 
single starting mutant as well as sequence inspection of the crossover points 
suggest that the removal of redundant RNA occurs randomly. The only common 
feature among all revertants appears the potential to form a hairpin with a 
short loop, suggesting that single-stranded RNA negatively affects the viability 
of the phage. To test this hypothesis, we introduced XbaI fragments of 34 
nucleotides that could form either a long stem with a small loop or a short stem 
with a large loop (26 nucleotides). The base-paired inserts were perfectly 
maintained for many generations, whereas the unpaired versions were quickly 
trimmed back to reduce the size of the loop. These data confirm that 
single-stranded RNA adversely affects phage fitness and is strongly selected 
against. The repair of the RNA genome that we describe here appears as the 
result of random recombination. Of the plethora of recombinants, only those able 
to adopt a base-paired structure survive. The frequency with which our inserts 
are removed seems higher than measured by others for small inserts in a reading 
frame in Q beta RNA. To account for this higher frequency, we suggest models in 
which the single-stranded nature of our inserts induces random recombination at 
the site of the insertion.

The loop between the F and G beta strands (FG loop) of the bacteriophage MS2 
coat protein subunit forms inter-subunit contacts around the 5-fold and 3-fold 
(quasi 6-fold) axes of the T=3 protein shell. In capsids, the loop is found in 
two very different conformations, one in B subunits, which form the 5-fold 
contact, and one in A and C subunits, which form the quasi 6-fold contact. One 
proline residue, Pro78, is strictly conserved in the coat protein of all related 
bacteriophages, and in the case of MS2 this proline residue is preceded by a cis 
peptide bond in the B subunit. In order to probe the role of the FG loop in 
capsid assembly, we have determined the crystal structures of two MS2 capsids, 
formed by coat proteins with mutations at two positions in the FG loop, P78N or 
E76D. These mutants show conformational changes in the FG loops that explain the 
reduced temperature stability of the capsids. The P78N mutant has a normal trans 
peptide bond at position 78.

[15-19-mer synthetic oligoribonucleotide as a model of the translation 
initiation segment of the phage fr replicase gene].

[Article in Russian]

Kumpin'sh VKh, Litsis NG, Renkhof RF, Stankevich EI, Berzin' VM.

Automatic solid-phase synthesis of 15-19-meric oligoribonucleotides was carried 
out using 5'-O-dimethoxytrityl-2'-O-(2-tetrahydropyranyl)- [or 
2'-O-(2-tetrahydrofuranyl)-] N-acylribonucleoside-3'-O-(methyl-N, 
N-diisopropyl)phosphoramidite synthons and 1-H-tetrazole as an activator. 
Comparative analysis of the template activity of the oligoribonucleotides 
synthesized, which are models of the translation initiation region of the 
replicase gene of MS2 and fr phages, showed that the minimal active fragment of 
RNA is a 16-mer containing the initiation AUG codon of the gene, a short spacer, 
a Shine-Dalgarno domain, and the 5'-terminal AUGA sequence with a functionally 
important termination AUG codon.

Secondary structure model for the first three domains of Q beta RNA. Control of 
A-protein synthesis.

We present a secondary structure model for the first 860 nucleotides of Q beta 
RNA. The model is supported by phylogenetic comparison, nuclease S1 structure 
probing and computer prediction using energy minimization and a Monte Carlo 
approach. To provide the necessary data for the comparative analysis we have 
sequenced the single-stranded RNA coliphages MX1, M11 and NL95. Together with 
the known sequences of Q beta and SP, this yields five sequences with sufficient 
sequence diversity to be useful for the analysis. The part of the Q beta genome 
examined contains the 60 nucleotide 5' untranslated region and the first 800 
nucleotide of the maturation protein gene. The RNA adopts a highly ordered 
structure in which all hairpins are held in place by a network of long-distance 
interactions, which form three-way and four-way junctions. Only the 5'-terminal 
hairpin is unrestrained, while connected by a few single-stranded nucleotides to 
the body of the RNA. The start region of the A-protein gene, which is part of 
the network of long-distance interactions, is base-paired to three 
non-contiguous downstream sequences. As a result, translation is expected to be 
progressively quenched when the length of the nascent chains increases. This 
feature explains the previous observation that A-protein synthesis on Q beta RNA 
can start only on short nascent strands. Translational control of the A protein 
in the distantly related phage MS2 was recently shown to be controlled by the 
kinetics of RNA folding. This basic difference and its possible biological 
purpose can be explained by the different RNA folding pathways in Q beta and 
MS2. Interestingly, due to the presence of G-U pairs, structure prediction for 
the minus strand differs in some aspects from that for the plus strand. More 
specifically, there is a minus-strand specific, long-distance interaction 
bordering the minus-strand equivalent of the 5'-terminal hairpin. This 
interaction extends at the expense of the lower part of the terminal helix, 
thereby exposing the terminal C residues at which replication starts. This 
long-distance interaction, which was recently shown to be required for 
minus-strand replication, is strongly supported by our comparative data.

RNA phage KU1 has an insertion of 18 nucleotides in the start codon of its lysis 
gene.

Author information:

Netherlands.

We have determined the nucleotide sequence of group II RNA phage KU1. The most 
conspicuous difference in the comparison with other group II members such as GA 
and JP34 is the presence of an insertion in the start codon of the lysis gene. 
In GA and JP34, the coat and lysis genes overlap by one nucleotide in the 
configuration UAAUG. The 18-nt insertion in KU1 is positioned between the A and 
the U of the start codon. It does not affect the coat reading frame, but it 
destroys the AUG start codon and separates the previously overlapping genes by 
17 nts. The insert creates a UUG codon at its 3' border which serves as the 
start site for lysis protein synthesis in KU1. We also show that analogous to 
the group I phages, such as MS2 and fr, expression of the lysis gene in KU1 and 
JP34 is coupled to termination of translation at the coat gene. RNA secondary 
structure models for the central parts of KU1 and JP34 are suggested which can 
account for the insertion as a separate stem-loop structure.

Improved method for selecting RNA-binding activities in vivo.

RNA challenge phages are modified versions of bacteriophage P22 that allow one 
to select directly for a specific RNA-protein interaction in vivo. The original 
construction method for generating a bacteriophage that encodes a specific RNA 
target requires two homologous recombination reactions between plasmids and 
phages in bacteria. An improved method is described that enables one to readily 
construct RNA challenge phages through a single homologous recombination 
reaction in vivo. We have applied the new method to construct a derivative of 
P22R17, an RNA challenge phage that undergoes lysogenic development in bacterial 
cells that express the bacteriophage R17/MS2 coat protein.

Pretreatment to reduce somatic Salmonella phage interference with FRNA coliphage 
assays : successful use in a one-year survey of vulnerable groundwaters.

Somatic salmonella (SS) phages were commonly found in higher numbers than 
F-specific RNA (FRNA) coliphages in a multi-site survey of 
contamination-vulnerable groundwaters. The relative abundance of SS phages 
required that a pretreatment procedure be implemented to reduce the SS phage 
content of samples before FRNA coliphage assay with Salmonella typhimurium WG49. 
Pretreatment involved selective SS phage removal by Salm. typhimurium WG45 
cells. This pretreatment proved effective in producing interference-free samples 
throughout the one-year survey period and in seeded evaluation, was shown not to 
affect the detection of representative FRNA coliphage MS2. During the survey, 30 
groundwater sites located in the continental United States, Puerto Rico and the 
Virgin Islands were examined for FRNA coliphages and SS phages at monthly 
intervals. FRNA coliphages were detected at six of the 30 sites and in 33 of 329 
monthly samples. SS phages were also detected at six sites and in 28 of 329 
monthly samples. Five of the phage-positive sites were positive for both phage 
groups. At those five sites, 58 monthly samples were collected during the survey 
period. Those 58 samples yielded an average FRNA coliphage concentration of 140 
pfu per 100 l of groundwater as compared to an average SS phage concentration of 
565 pfu per 100 l of groundwater. Twenty of the 58 samples were positive for 
both the FRNA coliphages and SS phages. In those samples, FRNA coliphages were 
more abundant in five samples; SS phages were more abundant in 15 samples. 
Because these results demonstrate that SS phage levels may often exceed FRNA 
coliphage levels in environmental waters, it is clear that SS phage removal 
procedures will greatly enhance the effectiveness of the WG49-based FRNA 
coliphage assay.

RNA-protein complexes.

The three commonly found RNA-binding domains, the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) 
domain, the double stranded RNA binding domain (dsRBD) and the K homology (KH) 
domain, have now been shown to have an alpha/beta fold similar to that found in 
many ribosomal proteins. Crystal structures of two hairpin RNA-protein complexes 
have been determined recently: the U1A spliceosomal protein bound to hairpin II 
of U1 small nuclear RNA, and MS2 bacteriophage capsid protein bound to a hairpin 
present at the ribosomal binding site of MS2 replicase mRNA. The crystal 
structure of the tryptophan operon RNA binding attenuation protein from Bacillus 
subtilis shows a novel structure with 11 monomers arranged in a doughnut-shaped 
ring that binds 11 copies of (U/G)AG triplets presented in the leader sequence 
of the tryptophan operon polycistronic message.

Complementation of RNA binding site mutations in MS2 coat protein heterodimers.

Peabody DS(1), Lim F.

Cancer Research and Treatment Center, Albuquerque, NM 87131, USA.

The coat protein of bacteriophage MS2 functions as a symmetric dimer to bind an 
asymmetric RNA hairpin. This implies the existence of two equivalent RNA binding 
sites related to one another by a 2-fold symmetry axis. In this view the 
symmetric binding site defined by mutations conferring the repressor-defective 
phenotype is a composite picture of these two asymmetric sites. In order to 
determine whether the RNA ligand interacts with amino acid residues on both 
subunits of the dimer and in the hope of constructing a functional map of the 
RNA binding site, we performed heterodimer complementation experiments. Taking 
advantage of the physical proximity of their N- and C-termini, the two subunits 
of the dimer were genetically fused, producing a duplicated coat protein which 
folds normally and allows the construction of the functional equivalent of 
obligatory heterodimers containing all possible pairwise combinations of the 
repressor-defective mutations. The restoration of repressor function in certain 
heterodimers shows that a single RNA molecule interacts with both subunits of 
the dimer and allows the construction of a functional map of the binding site.

The crystal structure of bacteriophage Q beta at 3.5 A resolution.

Author information:
(1)Department of Molecular Biology, Uppsala University, BMC, Sweden.

BACKGROUND: The capsid protein subunits of small RNA bacteriophages form a T = 3 
particle upon assembly and RNA encapsidation. Dimers of the capsid protein 
repress translation of the replicase gene product by binding to the ribosome 
binding site and this interaction is believed to initiate RNA encapsidation. We 
have determined the crystal structure of phage Q beta with the aim of clarifying 
which factors are the most important for particle assembly and RNA interaction 
in the small phages.
RESULTS: The crystal structure of bacteriophage Q beta determined at 3.5 A 
resolution shows that the capsid is stabilized by disulfide bonds on each side 
of the flexible loops that are situated around the fivefold and quasi-sixfold 
axes. As in other small RNA phages, the protein capsid is constructed from 
subunits which associate into dimers. A contiguous ten-stranded antiparallel 
beta sheet facing the RNA is formed in the dimer. The disulfide bonds lock the 
constituent dimers of the capsid covalently in the T = 3 lattice.
CONCLUSIONS: The unusual stability of the Q beta particle is due to the tight 
dimer interactions and the disulfide bonds linking each dimer covalently to the 
rest of the capsid. A comparison with the structure of the related phage MS2 
shows that although the fold of the Q beta coat protein is very similar, the 
details of the protein-protein interactions are completely different. The most 
conserved region of the protein is at the surface, which, in MS2, is involved in 
RNA binding.

Post-transcriptional regulation of CspA expression in Escherichia coli.

Brandi A(1), Pietroni P, Gualerzi CO, Pon CL.

Author information:
(1)Department of Biology, University of Camerino, Italy.

The Escherichia coli cspA gene, encoding the major cold-shock protein CspA, was 
deprived of its natural promoter and placed in an expression vector under the 
control of the inducible lambda PL promoter. After induction of transcription by 
thermal inactivation of the lambda ts repressor, abundant expression of the 
product (CspA) was obtained if the cells were subsequently incubated at 10 
degrees C, but poor expression was obtained if the cells were incubated at 37 
degrees C or 30 degrees C. The reason for this differential 
temperature-dependent expression was investigated and it was found that: (i) the 
CspA content of the cells decreased more rapidly at 37 degrees C compared to 10 
degrees C, regardless of whether transcription was turned off by addition of 
rifampicin; (ii) both the chemical and functional half-lives of the cspA 
transcript were substantially longer at 10 degrees C compared to 37 degrees C; 
(iii) S30 extracts as well as 70S ribosomes prepared from cold-shocked cells 
translated CspA mRNA (but not phage MS2 RNA) more efficiently than equivalent 
extracts or ribosomes obtained from control cells grown at 37 degrees C; and 
(iv) purified CspA stimulated CspA mRNA translation. Overall, these results 
indicate that a selective modification of the cold-shocked translational 
apparatus favouring translation of CspA mRNA, and an increased stability of this 
mRNA at low temperature, may play an important role in the induction of cspA 
expression during cold shock.

Evolutionary reconstruction of a hairpin deleted from the genome of an RNA

Laboratories, University of Leiden, The Netherlands.

The intercistronic region between the maturation and coat-protein genes of RNA 
phage MS2 contains important regulatory and structural information. The sequence 
participates in two adjacent stem-loop structures, one of which, the 
coat-initiator hairpin, controls coat-gene translation and is thus under strong 
selection pressure. We have removed 19 out of the 23 nucleotides constituting 
the intercistronic region, thereby destroying the capacity of the phage to build 
the two hairpins. The deletion lowered coat-protein yield more than 1000-fold, 
and the titer of the infectious clone carrying the deletion dropped 10 orders of 
magnitude as compared with the wild type. Two types of revertants were 
recovered. One had, in two steps, recruited 18 new nucleotides that served to 
rebuild the two hairpins and the lost Shine-Dalgarno sequence. The other type 
had deleted an additional six nucleotides, which allowed the reconstruction of 
the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the initiator hairpin, albeit by sacrificing the 
remnants of the other stem-loop. The results visualize the immense genetic 
repertoire created by, what appears as, random RNA recombination. It would seem 
that in this genetic ensemble every possible new RNA combination is represented.

The coat proteins of the RNA bacteriophages Qbeta and MS2 are specific RNA 
binding proteins. Although they possess common tertiary structures, they bind 
different RNA stem loops and thus provide useful models of specific protein-RNA 
recognition. Although the RNA-binding site of MS2 coat protein has been 
extensively characterized previously, little is known about Qbeta. Here we 
describe the isolation of mutants that define the RNA-binding site of Qbeta coat 
protein, showing that, as with MS2, it resides on the surface of a large 
beta-sheet. Mutations are also described that convert Qbeta coat protein to the 
RNA binding specificity of MS2. The results of these and other studies indicate 
that, although they bind different RNAs, the binding sites of the two coat 
proteins are sufficiently similar that each is easily converted by mutation to 
the RNA binding specificity of the other.

Formation of bacteriophage MS2 infectious units in a cell-free translation 
system.

Katanaev VL(1), Spirin AS, Reuss M, Siemann M.

Author information:
(1)Institute of Biochemical Engineering, University of Stuttgart, Germany.

We show that a simple cell-free translation system from Escherichia coli, 
programmed with phage MS2 RNA, is able to infect F+ E. coli cells. The plaques 
appearing on the E. coli host strain are morphologically indistinguishable from 
those derived from normal phage MS2 infection. This effect is strictly 
translation-dependent, since an incomplete translation system or the system 
inhibited by antibiotics leads to no infection. The cell-free based infection is 
maximal under conditions favouring the highest synthesis of maturation protein 
(one of the four phage-encoded proteins). The infection is abolished when RNase 
A or trypsin treatment is included before addition of cells. Similarly, due to 
RNA and maturation protein degradation, the continued incubation of the 
translation mixture under protein synthesis conditions significantly decreases 
infectivity. These findings suggest the formation of 'minimal infectious units', 
simple complexes of MS2 RNA and maturation protein. Here we describe the first 
example of bacteriophage infectious unit formation directly performed in a 
cell-free translation system. A possible application of this phenomenon might be 
the construction of newly designed RNA vector delivery systems and, moreover, 
could be an approach for molecular evolution studies.

Cell-specific delivery of bacteriophage-encapsidated ricin A chain.

Wu M(1), Brown WL, Stockley PG.

Author information:
(1)Department of Genetics, University of Leeds, UK.

We have used covalent coupling of deglycosylated ricin A chain (RAC) to the 
assembly initiation/translational repression RNA stem-loop (TR) of the 
bacteriophage MS2 to direct encapsulation of the toxin in bacteriophage capsids. 
Multiple copies of the TR-RAC conjugate can be incorporated into single capsid 
shells. The resultant particles can then be directed to specific cells by 
receptor-mediated endocytosis (RME) of complexes formed with anti-MS2 coat 
protein antibodies or by further covalent modification of the capsids by 
addition of human transferrin molecules. The results suggest that bacteriophage 
encapsulation and targeting is an efficient way to deliver toxins in a 
cell-specific fashion. The system may have widespread application in the field 
of targeted drug delivery, including antisense reagents.

There are four groups of RNA bacteriophages with distinct antigenic and 
physicochemical properties due to differences in surface residues of the viral 
coat proteins. Coat proteins also play a role as translational repressor during 
the viral life cycle, binding an RNA hairpin within the genome. In this study, 
the first crystal structure of the coat protein from a Group II phage GA is 
reported and compared to the Group I MS2 coat protein. The structure of the GA 
dimer was determined at 2.8 A resolution (R-factor = 0.20). The overall folding 
pattern of the coat protein is similar to the Group I MS2 coat protein in the 
intact virus (Golmohammadi R, Valegård K, Fridborg K, Liljas L. 1993, J Mol Biol 
234:620-639) or as an unassembled dimer (Ni Cz, Syed R, Kodandapani R. 
Wickersham J, Peabody DS, Ely KR, 1995, Structure 3:255-263). The structures 
differ in the FG loops and in the first turn of the alpha A helix. GA and MS2 
coat proteins differ in sequence at 49 of 129 amino acid residues. Sequence 
differences that contribute to distinct immunological and physical properties of 
the proteins are found at the surface of the intact virus in the AB and FG 
loops. There are six differences in potential RNA contact residues within the 
RNA-binding site located in an antiparallel beta-sheet across the dimer 
interface. Three differences involve residues in the center of this concave 
site: Lys/Arg 83, Ser/Asn 87, and Asp/Glu 89. Residue 87 was shown by molecular 
genetics to define RNA-binding specificity by GA or MS2 coat protein (Lim F. 
Spingola M, Peabody DS, 1994, J Biol Chem 269:9006-9010). This sequence 
difference reflects recognition of the nucleotide at position -5 in the unpaired 
loop of the translational operators bound by these coat proteins. In GA, the 
nucleotide at this position is a purine whereas in MS2, it is a pyrimidine.

We have introduced 13 base substitutions into the coat protein gene of RNA 
bacteriophage MS2. The mutations, which are clustered ahead of the overlapping 
lysis cistron, do not change the amino acid sequence of the coat protein, but 
they disrupt a local hairpin, which is needed to control translation of the 
lysis gene. The mutations decreased the phage titer by four orders of magnitude 
but, upon passaging, the virus accumulated suppressor mutations that raised the 
fitness to almost wild-type level. Analysis of the pseudorevertants showed that 
the disruption of the local hairpin, controlling expression of the lysis gene, 
had apparently been so complete that its restoration by chance mutations could 
not be achieved. Instead, alternative foldings initiated by the starting 
mutations were further stabilized and optimized. Strikingly, in the 
pseudorevertants analyzed, translational control of the lysis gene had been 
restored. This feat was accomplished by, on average, four suppressor mutations 
that generally occurred at codon wobble positions. We also introduced 11 
mutations in a hairpin more upstream in the coat protein gene and not implicated 
in lysis control. Here the titer dropped by three logs, but pseudorevertants 
with a fitness close to wild-type were soon generated. These pseudorevertants 
again were the result of the optimization of alternative foldings induced by the 
mutations. The transition of the secondary structure from wild-type to 
pseudorevertant could be visualized by structure probing. Our study shows that 
the folding of the RNA is an important phenotypic property of RNA viruses. 
However, its distortion can easily be overcome by optimizing alternative 
base-pairings. These new structures are not qualitatively equivalent to the 
original one, since they do not successfully compete with the wild-type.

Analysis of phage MS2 coat protein mutants expressed from a reconstituted 
phagemid reveals that proline 78 is essential for viral infectivity.

A full-length cDNA copy of the RNA genome of bacteriophage MS2 was assembled by 
the in-frame ligation of the central portion of the genome into a plasmid 
containing the 5' and 3' ends. Upon transformation of the ligation reaction into 
Escherichia coli, infectious phage particles were released into the medium. The 
plaquing ability of the phage produced from the cDNA construct was assessed 
against various bacterial strains confirming that the bacteriophage produced 
were male-specific. Sensitivity to RNase in agar overlay was used to confirm 
that the phage contained RNA. In addition, the phage were unable to infect 
piliated cells overexpressing MS2 coat protein, a resistance conferred by the 
binding of recombinant coat protein to the infecting strand of RNA at the 
replicase initiation region, thus preventing translation of the replicase gene. 
The phage capsids were visualised after negative staining by transmission 
electron microscopy, and appeared as spherical particles of approximately 25 nm 
diameter. The capsid proteins were examined by Western blotting, confirming the 
presence of a single protein of approximately 14 kDa, which bound anti-MS2 coat 
protein antibodies. The genomic RNA from single plaques was analysed by reverse 
transcription-PCR and the presence of the MS2 coat protein gene confirmed by DNA 
sequencing. The production of replicative MS2 phage from cDNA fragments was used 
to assess the viability of MS2 coat protein mutants, which had previously been 
shown to assemble into T = 3 capsid-like particles when expressed in vivo from a 
bacterial vector. The E76D mutation did not appear to affect phage viability, 
whilst replacement of the completely conserved P78 residue with asparagine 
abolished the production of infectious particles, suggesting that P78 may be 
involved in interactions with the phage maturation protein.

The construction of a mouse hybridoma FR52 secreting neutralizing monoclonal 
antibody specific for RNA bacteriophages fr, MS2 and GA is reported. The genes 
encoding the variable domains of the monoclonal antibody FR52 heavy and light 
chains were cloned and sequenced and the corresponding complementarity 
determining region (CDR) peptides were chemically synthesized. The CDR-peptides 
were tested for their ability to neutralize the activity of RNA phage fr and 
related RNA phages MS2 and GA. The CDR-derived peptides H2, L2 and L3 interacted 
with the fr phage particles and neutralized fr phage activity. Two of these 
peptides--H2 and L3 also had the ability to neutralize partly the activity of 
related bacteriophage MS2, but L1 and especially L3 neutralize the activity of 
the RNA phage GA. These results provide an excellent system for further 
antibody-antigen interaction studies and raise the possibility that simple 
CDR-peptides may serve as a new class of anti-viral molecules.

Direct genetic selection of two classes of R17/MS2 coat proteins with altered

Avenue, Urbana, IL 61801, USA.

RNA challenge phages are derivatives of bacteriophage P22 that enable direct 
genetic selection for a specific RNA-protein interaction. The bacteriophage P22 
R17 encodes a wild-type R17 operator site and undergoes lysogenic development 
following infection of susceptible bacterial strains that express the R17/MS2 
coat protein. A P22 R17 derivative with an OcRNA site (P22 R17 [A(-10)U]) 
develops lytically following infection of these strains. RNA challenge phages 
can be used to isolate second-site coat protein suppressors that recognize an 
OcRNA sequence by selecting for lysogens with a P22 R17 [Oc] phage derivative. 
The bacteriophage derivative P22 R17 [A(-10)U] was used in one such scheme to 
isolate two classes of genes that encode R17 coat proteins with altered capsid 
assembly properties and expanded RNA-binding characteristics. These mutations 
map outside the RNA-binding surface and include amino acid substitutions that 
interfere with interactions between coat protein dimers in the formation of the 
stable phage capsid. One class of mutants encodes substitutions at the highly 
conserved first and second positions of the mature coat protein. N-terminal 
sequence analysis of these mutants reveals that coat proteins with substitutions 
only at position 1 are defective in post-translational processing of the 
initiator methionine. All selected proteins possess expanded RNA-binding 
properties since they direct efficient lysogen formation for P22 R17 and P22 R17 
[A(-10)U]; however, bacterial strains that express the protein mutants remain 
sensitive to lytic infection by other P22 R17 [Oc] bacteriophages. The described 
selection strategy provides a novel genetic approach to dissecting protein 
structure within RNA-binding proteins.

Development of an improved product enhanced reverse transcriptase assay.

Chang A(1), Ostrove JM, Bird RE.

Author information:
(1)Microbiological Associates, Rockville, MD 20850, USA. achang@microbio.com

A PCR based reverse transcriptase (RT) assay was developed that has 10(4)-fold 
higher sensitivity than conventional nucleotide incorporation assays and allows 
discrimination between false positive results generated by cellular polymerases 
and positives resulting from authentic RT activity. Recently, several reverse 
transcriptase (RT) assays have been developed where a reverse transcriptase 
reaction is performed on an RNA template/DNA primer combination. A specific 
region of the cDNA product is then amplified by the polymerase chain reaction to 
increase the sensitivity of cDNA detection. These reverse transcriptase assays 
up to 10(6)-fold more sensitive at detecting retroviruses than conventional 
methods. The drawback to these assays with increased sensitivity is the 
increased incidence of false positive results generated by cellular polymerases 
that can reverse transcribe. The MS2 bacteriophage RNA template and primers from 
one of the recently developed assays were used as the basis to develop the 
assay. A simple high resolution agarose gel was used as the endpoint for the 
assay without compromising sensitivity. In addition, the pH of the RT reaction 
was lowered to pH 5.5, the RT incubation was 1 h, and protease inhibitors were 
added to the RT reaction components. These modifications yield an assay that can 
discriminate between authentic RT activity and contaminating cellular 
polymerases.

Role of the coat protein-RNA interaction in the life cycle of bacteriophage MS2.

Peabody DS(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Cell Biology, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, 
Albuquerque, NM 87131, USA.

The coat protein of the RNA bacteriophage MS2 interacts with viral RNA to 
translationally repress replicase synthesis. This protein-RNA interaction is 
also thought to play a role in genome encapsidation. In this study the strength 
of the interaction was perturbed by constructing a recombinant genome containing 
a super-repressing coat mutation. Because replicase synthesis is prematurely 
repressed, the mutant produces plaques about five orders of magnitude less 
efficiently than wild-type. The few plaques obtained are second-site revertants 
of the original coat mutation and fall into two categories. Those of the first 
type contain nucleotide substitutions within the translational operator that 
reduce or destroy its ability to bind coat protein, showing that this 
interaction is not necessary for genome encapsidation. Revertants of the second 
type are double mutants in which one substitution converts the coat initiator 
AUG to AUA and the other substitutes an A for the G normally present two 
nucleotides upstream of the coat start codon. The mutation of the coat protein 
gene AUG to AUA, by itself, reduces coat protein synthesis to a few percent of 
the wild-type level. The second substitution destabilizes the coat initiator 
stem-loop and restores coat protein synthesis to within a few fold of wild-type 
levels.

In order to study the role played by known and novel genes in growth control and 
neoplasia, we here compare the pEX and pGEX bacterial expression systems for 
recombinant oncoprotein production and for generation of specific antisera. The 
results of five pEX (MS2-c-Fos, MS2-Fra-1, MS2-JunD, bgal-c-Jun and bgal-JunB) 
and two pGEX [glutathione S-transferase (GSH)-JE/MCP-1 and GST-JunD] 
fusion-protein productions are presented. Higher (15-43-fold) yields are 
obtained with the pEX system, but only the pGEX system allows separation of the 
protein of interest from the fusion moiety by digestion with specific proteases. 
The degree of fusion-protein purification, as assessed by SDS/PAGE, is similar 
for both systems. Proteins produced by both systems were successfully used in 
the generation of specific antisera. The choice between the pEX and pGEX systems 
is dependent upon the specific recombinant protein produced.

MS2 coat protein mutants which bind Qbeta RNA.

Spingola M(1), Peabody DS.

Author information:
(1)Department of Cell Biology, University of New Mexico School of Medicine and 
Cancer Research and Treatment Center, Albuquerque, NM 87131, USA.

The coat proteins of the RNA phages MS2 and Qbetaare structurally homologous, 
yet they specifically bind different RNA structures. In an effort to identify 
the basis of RNA binding specificity we sought to isolate mutants that convert 
MS2 coat protein to the RNA binding specificity of Qbeta. A library of mutations 
was created which selectively substitutes amino acids within the RNA binding 
site. Genetic selection for the ability to repress translation from the 
Qbetatranslational operator led to the isolation of several MS2 mutants that 
acquired binding activity for QbetaRNA. Some of these also had reduced abilities 
to repress translation from the MS2 translational operator. These changes in RNA 
binding specificity were the results of substitutions of amino acid residues 87 
and 89. Additional codon- directed mutagenesis experiments confirmed earlier 
results showing that the identity of Asn87 is important for specific binding of 
MS2 RNA. Glu89, on the other hand, is not required for recognition of MS2 RNA, 
but prevents binding of QbetaRNA.

Persistence of MS-2 and PRD-1 bacteriophages in an ultrapure water system.

Governal RA(1), Gerba CP.

Author information:
(1)International Innovative Technologies, Tucson, AZ 85746, USA.

The persistence of bacteriophages MS-2 and PRD-1 was evaluated in tap water, in 
reverse osmosis (RO) permeate, and in three locations within an ultrapure water 
system; ultrapure samples included pre- and post-UV sterilization and post-mixed 
bed ion exchange tank. The inactivation rates for MS-2 were calculated as log10 
reduction per hour and per day: k = -(log 10 Ct/C0)/t. PRD-1 was found to 
persist with no significant loss of infectivity in all water purity environments 
evaluated. Inactivation of MS-2 was dependent on water quality and pH. 
Short-term inactivation rates for chlorinated tap water, post-RO, pre-UV, 
post-UV and post-ion exchange sample locations were 0.028, 0.455, 0.231, 0.191 
and 0.168 log10 h-1, respectively. Long-term inactivation rates for chlorinated 
tap water, post-RO, pre-UV, post-UV and post-ion exchange sample locations were 
0.485, 0.911, 0.605, 0.632 and 0.684 log10 day-1, respectively. Since phages 
were found to remain intact as well as to lyse in the ultrapure water 
environment, the phages have the potential to contaminate the ultrapure water 
environments of the microelectronics, pharmaceutical and power generation 
industries in both colloidal and dissolved form. Further work is proceeding to 
generate standardized and cost-effective methods to detect viruses in water 
environments.

The three-dimensional structures of two complexes between recombinant MS2 
capsids and RNA operator fragments reveal sequence-specific protein-RNA 
interactions.

Crystal structures of two complexes between recombinant MS2 capsids and RNA 
operator fragments have been determined at 2.7 A resolution. The coat protein of 
the RNA bacteriophage MS2 is bifunctional; it forms the icosahedral virus shell 
to protect the viral nucleic acid and it acts as a translational repressor by 
binding with high specificity to a unique site on the RNA, a single stem-loop 
structure, containing the initiation codon of the gene for the viral replicase. 
In order to determine the structure of these protein-RNA complexes, we have used 
chemically synthesized variants of the stem-loop fragment and soaked them into 
crystals of recombinant capsids. The RNA stem-loop, as bound to the protein, 
forms a crescent-like structure and interacts with the surface of the beta-sheet 
of a coat protein dimer. It makes protein contacts with seven phosphate groups 
on the 5' side of the stem-loop, with a pyrimidine base at position -5, which 
stacks onto a tyrosine, and with two exposed adenine bases, one in the loop and 
one at a bulge in the stem. Replacement of the wild-type uridine with a cytosine 
at position -5 increases the affinity of the RNA to the dimer significantly. The 
complex with RNA stem-loop having cytosine at this position differs from that of 
the wild-type complex mainly by having one extra intramolecular RNA interaction 
and one extra water-mediated hydrogen bond.

RNA folding kinetics regulates translation of phage MS2 maturation gene.

Laboratories, University of Leiden, P.O. Box 9502, 2300 RA Leiden, The 
Netherlands.

The gene for the maturation protein of the single-stranded RNA coliphage MS2 is 
preceded by an untranslated leader of 130 nt, which folds into a cloverleaf, 
i.e., three stem-loop structures enclosed by a long distance interaction (LDI). 
This LDI prevents translation because its 3' moiety contains the Shine-Dalgarno 
sequence of the maturation gene. Previously, several observations suggested that 
folding of the cloverleaf is kinetically delayed, providing a time window for 
ribosomes to access the RNA. Here we present direct evidence for this model. In 
vitro experiments show that ribosome binding to the maturation gene is faster 
than refolding of the denatured cloverleaf. This folding delay appears related 
to special properties of the leader sequence. We have replaced the three 
stem-loop structures by a single five nt loop. This change does not affect the 
equilibrium structure of the LDI. Nevertheless, in this construct, the folding 
delay has virtually disappeared, suggesting that now the RNA folds faster than 
ribosomes can bind. Perturbation of the cloverleaf by an insertion makes the 
maturation start permanently accessible. A pseudorevertant that evolved from an 
infectious clone carrying the insertion had overcome this defect. It showed a 
wild-type folding delay before closing down the maturation gene. This experiment 
reveals the biological significance of retarded cloverleaf formation.

The three-dimensional structure of the small T=3 RNA bacteriophage GA has been 
determined at 3.4 A resolution. The structure was solved by molecular 
replacement, using the phage MS2 as an initial model. A comparison of the 
protein shells of the four related phages GA, MS2, fr and Qbeta was carried out 
in order to define structural features of particular importance for their 
assembly and specific RNA interaction. A high degree of similarity was found in 
the RNA binding sites, whereas larger structural differences are located in the 
loop regions of the coat proteins, especially in the FG loops forming 5-fold and 
quasi-6-fold contacts. The overall arrangement of the protein subunits in the 
shells of these phages is very similar, although the details of the interactions 
differ. The few conserved interactions are suggested to govern the subunit 
packing during assembly.

Mechanism of action of oxazolidinones: effects of linezolid and eperezolid on 
translation reactions.

The oxazolidinones are a new class of synthetic antibiotics with good activity 
against gram-positive pathogenic bacteria. Experiments with a susceptible 
Escherichia coli strain, UC6782, demonstrated that in vivo protein synthesis was 
inhibited by both eperezolid (formerly U-100592) and linezolid (formerly 
U-100766). Both linezolid and eperezolid were potent inhibitors of cell-free 
transcription-translation in E. coli, exhibiting 50% inhibitory concentrations 
(IC50s) of 1.8 and 2.5 microM, respectively. The ability to demonstrate 
inhibition of in vitro translation directed by phage MS2 RNA was greatly 
dependent upon the amount of RNA added to the assay. For eperezolid, 128 microg 
of RNA per ml produced an IC50 of 50 microM whereas a concentration of 32 
microg/ml yielded an IC50 of 20 microM. Investigating lower RNA template 
concentrations in linezolid inhibition experiments revealed that 32 and 8 microg 
of MS2 phage RNA per ml produced IC50s of 24 and 15 microM, respectively. This 
phenomenon was shared by the translation initiation inhibitor kasugamycin but 
not by streptomycin. Neither oxazolidinone inhibited the formation of 
N-formylmethionyl-tRNA, elongation, or termination reactions of bacterial 
translation. The oxazolidinones appear to inhibit bacterial translation at the 
initiation phase of protein synthesis.

Rescue of the RNA phage genome from RNase III cleavage.

2300 RA Leiden, The Netherlands.

The secondary structure of the RNA from the single-stranded RNA bacteriophages, 
like MS2 and Qb, has evolved to serve a variety of functions such as controlling 
gene expression, exposing binding sites for the replicase and capsid proteins, 
allowing strand separation and so forth. On the other hand, all of these 
foldings have to perform in bacterial cells in which various RNA splitting 
enzymes are present. We therefore examined whether phage RNA structure is under 
selective pressure by host RNases. Here we show this to be true for RNase III. A 
fully double-stranded hairpin of 17 bp, which is an RNase III target, was 
inserted into a non-coding region of the MS2 RNA genome. In an RNase III-host 
these phages survived but in wild-type bacteria they did not. Here the stem 
underwent Darwinian evolution to a structure that was no longer a substrate for 
RNase III. This was achieved in three different ways: (i) the perfect stem was 
maintained but shortened by removing all or most of the insert; (ii) the stem 
acquired suppressor mutations that replaced Watson-Crick base pairs by 
mismatches; (iii) the stem acquired small deletions or insertions that created 
bulges. These insertions consist of short stretches of non-templated A or U 
residues. Their origin is ascribed to polyadenylation at the site of the RNase 
III cut (in the + or - strand) either by Escherichia coli poly(A) polymerase or 
by idling MS2 replicase.

Subunit fusion confers tolerance to peptide insertions in a virus coat protein.

Peabody DS(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, University of New Mexico 
School of Medicine and, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87131, USA.

An octapeptide sequence called Flag was inserted into the bacteriophage MS2 coat 
protein at two different locations and its effects on protein folding and virus 
assembly were determined. Assays of the translational repressor and capsid 
assembly functions of the recombinants show that when the peptide is inserted at 
its N-terminus coat protein folds properly into the form that binds RNA (i.e., 
the dimer), but is defective for capsid assembly. On the other hand, a 
recombinant protein which is expected to display the Flag insertion as a surface 
loop does not fold correctly and, as a consequence, is proteolytically degraded. 
Genetic fusion of the two subunits of the coat dimer results in a protein 
considerably more tolerant of these structural perturbations and mostly corrects 
the defects accompanying Flag peptide insertion. Increased resistance of the 
single-chain coat protein to urea denaturation indicates that the fused dimer is 
substantially more stable than wild type. Covalent joining of subunits of 
oligomers probably represents a general strategy for engineering increased 
protein stability.

Functional recognition of fragmented operator sites by R17/MS2 coat protein, a 
translational repressor.

The R17/MS2 coat protein serves as a translational repressor of replicase by 
binding to a 19 nt RNA hairpin containing the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the 
initiation codon of the replicase gene. We have explored the structural features 
of the RNA operator site that are necessary for efficient translational 
repression by the R17/MS2 coat protein in vivo . The R17/MS2 coat protein 
efficiently directs lysogen formation for P22 R17 , a bacteriophage P22 
derivative that carries the R17/MS2 RNA operator site within the P22 phage ant 
mRNA. Phages were constructed that contain fragmented operator sites such that 
the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the initiation codon of the affected gene are 
not located within the RNA hairpin. The wild-type coat protein directs efficient 
lysogen formation for P22 phages that carry several fragmented RNA operator 
sites, including one in which the Shine-Dalgarno sequence is positioned 4 nt 
outside the coat protein binding site. Neither the wild-type R17/MS2 coat 
protein nor super-repressor mutants induce lysogen formation for a P22 phage 
encoding an RNA hairpin at a distance of 9 nt from the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, 
implying that a discrete region of biological repression is defined by the coat 
protein-RNA hairpin interaction. The assembly of RNA species into capsid 
structures is not an efficient means whereby the coat protein achieves 
translational repression of target mRNA transcripts. The R17/MS2 coat protein 
exerts translational regulation that extends considerably beyond the natural 
biological RNA operator site structure; however, the coat protein still mediates 
repression in these constructs by preventing ribosome access to linear sequence 
determinants of the translational initiation region by the formation of a stable 
RNA secondary structure. An efficient translational regulatory mechanism in 
bacteria appears to reside in the ability of proteins to regulate RNA folding 
states for host cell and phage mRNAs.

A new ozone-based method for virus inactivation: preliminary study.

The nebulization technique reported here could be used to inactivate viruses 
with ozone in large volumes of body fluids, such as plasma, partial blood and 
perhaps whole blood in a short time. Coliphage MS2 was used as a model because 
it is safe, easy to handle and more resistant to chemical disinfections than 
viruses such as HIV. The theoretical curves and experimental points, describing 
ozone inactivation of MS2, form a semi-sigmoid of congruent data. There was a > 
7log10 reduction in MS2 viability and the possibilities of minimizing the ozone 
concentration required to kill viruses are indicated. The analysis was expanded 
to account for the interaction of ozone with a virus suspension in the shape of 
a thin film from the experimental findings of Bolton et al. We again find a 
semi-sigmoid of congruent data for their case, i.e. describing ozone 
inactivation of the influenza A virus (WSN strain) and the vesicular stomatitis 
virus versus time. For the method of nebulization, the exposure time of droplets 
with ozone is a few seconds, whereas for the thin film method the exposure time 
is measured in hours.

Riverside 92521, USA.

Batch sorption experiments were carried out with the bacteriophages MS2 and phi 
X174. Two types of reactor vessels, polypropylene and glass, were used. 
Consistently lower concentrations of MS2 were found in the liquid phase in the 
absence of soil (control blanks) than in the presence of soil after mixing. High 
levels of MS2 inactivation (approximately 99.9%) were observed in control tubes 
made of polypropylene (PP), with comparatively little loss of virus seen in PP 
tubes when soil was present. Minimal inactivation of MS2 was observed when the 
air-water interface was completely eliminated from PP control blanks during 
mixing. All batch experiments performed with reactor tubes made of glass 
demonstrated no substantial inactivation of MS2. In similar experiments, 
bacteriophage phi X174 did not undergo inactivation in either PP or glass 
control blanks, implying that this virus is not affected by the same factors 
which led to inactivation of MS2 in the PP control tubes. When possible, phage 
adsorption to soil was calculated by the Freundlich isotherm. Our data suggest 
that forces associated with the air-water-solid interface (where the solid is a 
hydrophobic surface) are responsible for inactivation of MS2 in the PP control 
tubes. The influence of air-water interfacial forces should be carefully 
considered when batch sorption experiments are conducted with certain viruses.

The crystal structure, at 2.8 A resolution, of an RNA aptamer bound to 
bacteriophage MS2 coat protein has been determined. It provides an opportunity 
to compare the interactions of MS2 coat protein and wild type operator with 
those of an aptamer, whose secondary structure differs from the wild type RNA in 
having a three-base loop (compared to a tetraloop) and an additional base pair 
between this loop and the sequence-specific recognition element in the stem. The 
RNA binds in the same location on the coat protein as the wild type operator and 
maintains many of the same RNA-protein interactions. In order to achieve this, 
the RNA stem loop undergoes a concerted rearrangement of the 3' side while 
leaving the 5' side and the loop interactions largely unchanged, illustrating 
the ability of RNA to present similar molecular recognition surfaces from 
distinct primary and secondary structures.

Delineating the specific influence of virus isoelectric point and size on virus

Many of the factors controlling viral transport and survival within the 
subsurface are still poorly understood. In order to identify the precise 
influence of viral isoelectric point on viral adsorption onto aquifer sediment 
material, we employed five different spherical bacteriophages (MS2, PRD1, Q 
beta, phi X174, and PM2) having differing isoelectric points (pI 3.9, 4.2, 5.3, 
6.6, and 7.3 respectively) in laboratory viral transport studies. We employed 
conventional batch flowthrough columns, as well as a novel continuously 
recirculating column, in these studies. In a 0.78-m batch flowthrough column, 
the smaller phages (MS2, phi X174, and Q beta), which had similar diameters, 
exhibited maximum effluent concentration/initial concentration values that 
correlated exactly with their isoelectric points. In the continuously 
recirculating column, viral adsorption was negatively correlated with the 
isoelectric points of the viruses. A model of virus migration in the soil 
columns was created by using a one-dimensional transport model in which kinetic 
sorption was used. The data suggest that the isoelectric point of a virus is the 
predetermining factor controlling viral adsorption within aquifers. The data 
also suggest that when virus particles are more than 60 nm in diameter, viral 
dimensions become the overriding factor.

The MS2 RNA operator capsid offers an unparalleled opportunity to study 
sequence-specific protein-protein and RNA-protein interactions in molecular 
detail. RNA molecules encompassing the minimal translational operator 
recognition elements can be soaked into crystals of RNA-free coat protein 
shells, allowing the RNA to access the interior of the capsids and make contact 
with the operator binding sites. Correct interpretation of these structural 
studies depends critically on functional analysis in solution to confirm that 
the interactions seen in the crystal are not an artefact of the unusual approach 
used to generate the RNA-protein complexes. Here we present a series of in vivo 
and in vitro functional assays, using coat proteins carrying single amino acid 
substitutions at residues which either interact with the operator RNA or are 
involved in stabilizing the conformation of the FG loop, the site of the major 
quasi-equivalent conformational change. Variant operator RNAs have been assayed 
for coat protein affinity in vitro. The results reveal the robustness of the 
operator-coat protein interaction and the requirement for both halves of a 
protein dimer to contact RNA in order to achieve tight binding. They also 
suggest that there may be a direct link between the conformation of the FG loop 
and RNA binding.

In MS2 assembly of phage particles results from an interaction between a coat 
protein dimer and a stem-loop of the RNA genome (the operator hairpin). Amino 
acid residues Thr45, which is universally conserved among the small RNA phages, 
and Thr59 are part of the specific RNA binding pocket and interact directly with 
the RNA; the former through a hydrogen bond, the latter through hydrophobic 
contacts. The crystal structures of MS2 protein capsids formed by mutants 
Thr45Ala and Thr59Ser, both with and without the 19 nt wild-type operator 
hairpin bound, are reported here. The RNA hairpin binds to these mutants in a 
similar way to its binding to wild-type protein. In a companion paper both 
mutants are shown to be deficient in RNA binding in an in vivo assay, but in 
vitro the equilibrium dissociation constant is significantly higher than 
wild-type for the Thr45Ala mutant. The change in binding affinity of the 
Thr45Ala mutant is probably a direct consequence of removal of direct hydrogen 
bonds between the protein and the RNA. The properties of the Thr59Ser mutant are 
more difficult to explain, but are consistent with a loss of non-polar contact.

The spectrophotometric study of complex formation between phage MS2 
single-stranded RNA and tilorone has been carried out. It was found that with 
components concentration forming "strong linkage" the absorption spectra of 
RNA-tilorone complex in UV-region experience hyperchromic and bathochromic 
shifts; besides, a new absorption maximum appears at 280 nm. The changes of 
spectral properties have been also detected in the long-waved region of the 
complex spectra. The conclusion has been made that in the course of 
single-stranded RNA with tilorone interactions a complex formation takes place 
due to interacalation between spontaneously appeared two-stranded regions in the 
structure of a single-stranded RNA and tilorone; which component stabilizes 
these structures and assures there by the previously described interferonogenic 
activity of a single-stranded RNA--tilorone complexes.

Translationally repressive RNA structures monitored in vivo using temperate DNA 
bacteriophages.

Urbana, IL, USA.

The RNA challenge phage system enables genetic selection of proteins with 
RNA-binding activity in bacteria. These phages are modified versions of the 
temperate DNA bacteriophage P22 in which post-transcriptional regulatory events 
control the developmental fate of the phage. The system was originally developed 
to identify novel RNA ligands that display reduced affinity for the R17/MS2 coat 
protein, as well as to select for suppressor coat proteins that recognize mutant 
RNA ligands. During the course of evaluating whether the HIV-1 Rev protein could 
direct lysogen development for bacteriophage derivatives that encode Rev 
response element (RRE) RNA sequences, two examples of RRE RNA ligands that 
interfere with challenge phage development were identified. In the phage 
examples described, RRE RNA secondary structure prevents Ant protein 
biosynthesis and lytic development. Phage lysogen formation occurs efficiently 
in recipient cells, independent of the expression status of the Rev protein or 
trans-acting competitor RRE RNA ligands. These studies provide the first example 
whereby RNA challenge phages may be applied to study RNA folding events and RNA 
structural interactions in an in vivo context.

bacteriophage.

The effect of exposure to 60-Hz electromagnetic fields (EMFs) on RNA coliphage 
MS2 replication was studied. EMF exposure commenced when the bacterial cultures 
were inoculated with the phage (t = 0). In 12 experiments in which the strength 
of the field was 5 G, a significant delay in phage yield was found in the 
EMF-exposed cultures 45-65 min after inoculation, compared with control 
cultures. However, the EMF did not alter the final phage concentration. 
Experiments at 25 G (N = 5) suggested that the stronger field resulted in both 
impeded phage replication and increased phage yield. No differences between test 
groups were found in experiments involving sham-EMF exposure, thereby indicating 
that the results obtained with the EMFs were not due to systematic error. It 
appears that MS2, which codes for only four proteins, is the simplest biological 
system in which an EMF-induced effect has been demonstrated. The MS2 system is, 
therefore, conducive to follow-up studies aimed at understanding the level and 
nature of the underlying interaction process, and perhaps to biophysical 
modeling of the interaction process.

The study of thermal denaturation for molecular complexes formed during 
interaction between phage MS2 single-stranded RNA and tilorone has been carried 
out. Both certain increase of Tm (by on 1.1) and the narrowing of complexes 
melting interval, delta T, (by 5.6 degrees C), have been detected. The value of 
hyperchromic effect, H, increases twice. The conclusion is made concerning the 
formation of double-stranded regions in single-stranded RNA molecules in the 
process of RNA--tilorone interactions. These results are discussed as an 
additional proof of our previous presumption concerning stabilization of 
spontaneously forming double-stranded RNA regions by tilorone binding.

In coliphage MS2 RNA a long-distance interaction (LDI) between an internal 
segment of the upstream coat gene and the start region of the replicase gene 
prevents initiation of replicase synthesis in the absence of coat gene 
translation. Elongating ribosomes break up the repressor LDI and thus activate 
the hidden initiation site. Expression studies on partial MS2 cDNA clones 
identified base pairing between 1427-1433 and 1738-1744, the so-called Min Jou 
(MJ) interaction, as the molecular basis for the long-range coupling mechanism. 
Here, we examine the biological significance of this interaction for the control 
of replicase gene translation. The LDI was disrupted by mutations in the 3'-side 
and the evolutionary adaptation was monitored upon phage passaging. Two 
categories of pseudorevertants emerged. The first type had restored the MJ 
interaction but not necessarily the native sequence. The pseudorevertants of the 
second type acquired a compensatory substitution some 80 nt downstream of the MJ 
interaction that stabilizes an adjacent LDI. In one examined case we confirmed 
that the second site mutations had restored coat-replicase translational 
coupling. Our results show the importance of translational control for fitness 
of the phage. They also reveal that the structure that buries the replicase 
start extends to structure elements bordering the MJ interaction.

Gene E-L, a chimeric lysis construct from bacteriophages phi X174 and MS2 lysis 
proteins E and L, respectively, was subjected to internal deletions to create a 
series of new E-L clones with altered lysis or killing properties. The lytic 
activities of the parental genes E. L. E-L and the internal truncated forms of 
E-L were investigated in this study to characterize the different lysis 
mechanisms, based on differences in the architecture of the different membrane 
spanning domains. Electron microscopy and release of marker enzymes for the 
cytoplasmic and periplasmic spaces revealed that two different lysis mechanisms 
can be distinguished depending on penetrating of the proteins either the inner 
membrane or the inner and outer membranes of Escherichia coli. Several 
candidates, which share efficient lysis properties, have biotechnological 
applications in terms of cell disruption.

Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry has enabled viral 
coat proteins to be characterized directly from the virus. This analysis, 
demonstrated here with tobacco mosaic virus U2, a bacteriophage MS2, and equine 
encephalitis TRD, is achieved with a combination of organic acid, UV-absorbing 
matrix, and high-energy desorption with a nitrogen laser. The molecular weights 
of these proteins are determined with sufficient accuracy to allow 
differentiation among viral species and strains. The abundant hydrophobic MS2 
coat protein was analyzed in aliquots of culture medium and of the tobacco 
mosaic virus coat protein in infected leaves. This method provides rapid 
detection of coat protein in the low-femtomole range, as estimated by titering 
plaque-forming units of MS2.

NMR structure and dynamics of an RNA motif common to the spliceosome 
branch-point helix and the RNA-binding site for phage GA coat protein.

Smith JS(1), Nikonowicz EP.

Author information:
(1)Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Rice University, Houston, Texas 
77251-1892, USA.

The RNA molecules that make up the spliceosome branch-point helix and the 
binding site for phage GA coat protein share a secondary structure motif in 
which two consecutive adenine residues occupy the strand opposite a single 
uridine, creating the potential to form one of two different A.U base pairs 
while leaving the other adenine unpaired or bulged. During the splicing of 
introns out of pre-mRNA, the 2'-OH of the bulged adenine participates in the 
transesterification reaction at the 5'-exon and forms the branch-point residue 
of the lariat intermediate. Either adenine may act as the branch-point residue 
in mammals, but the 3'-proximal adenine does so preferentially. When bound to 
phage GA coat protein, the bulged adenine loops out of the helix and occupies a 
binding pocket on the surface of the protein, forming a nucleation complex for 
phage assembly. The coat protein can bind helices with bulged adenines at either 
position, but the 3'-proximal site binds with greater affinity. We have studied 
this RNA motif in a 21 nucleotide hairpin containing a GA coat protein-binding 
site whose four nucleotide loop has been replaced by a more stable loop from the 
related phage Ms2. Using heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy, we have determined the 
structure of this hairpin to an overall precision of 2.0 A. Both adenine bases 
stack into the helix, and while all available NOE and coupling constant data are 
consistent with both possible A.U base pairs, the base pair involving the 
5'-proximal adenine appears to be the major conformation. The 3'-proximal bulged 
adenine protonates at unusually high pH, and to account for this, we propose a 
model in which the protonated adenine is stabilized by a hydrogen bond to the 
uridine O2 of the A.U base pair. The 2'-OH of the bulged adenine adopts a 
regular A-form helical geometry, suggesting that in order to participate in the 
splicing reaction, the conformation of the branch-point helix in the active 
spliceosome may change from the conformation described here. Thus, while the 
adenine site preferences of the spliceosome and of phage GA may be due to 
protein factors, the preferred adenine is predisposed in the free RNA to 
conformational rearrangement involved in formation of the active complexes.

The coat protein of bacteriophage MS2 is known to bind specifically to an RNA 
hairpin formed within the MS2 genome. Structurally this hairpin is built up by 
an RNA double helix interrupted by one unpaired nucleotide and closed by a 
four-nucleotide loop. We have performed crystallographic studies of complexes 
between MS2 coat protein capsids and four RNA hairpin variants in order to 
evaluate the minimal requirements for tight binding to the coat protein and to 
obtain more information about the three-dimensional structure of these hairpins. 
An RNA fragment including the four loop nucleotides and a two-base-pair stem but 
without the unpaired nucleotide is sufficient for binding to the coat protein 
shell under the conditions used in this study. In contrast, an RNA fragment 
containing a stem with the unpaired nucleotide but missing the loop nucleotides 
does not bind to the protein shell.

Center, New York, NY 10021, USA. pateld@mskcc.org

Recently, progress has been made towards the structural characterization of the 
novel folds of RNA-bound arginine-rich peptides and the architecture of their 
peptide-binding RNA pockets in viral and phage systems. These studies are based 
on an approach whereby the peptide and RNA components are minimalist modular 
domains that undergo adaptive structural transitions upon complex formation. 
Such complexes are characterized by recognition alignments in which the tertiary 
fold of the RNA generates binding pockets with the potential to envelop minimal 
elements of protein secondary structure. Strikingly, the peptides fold as 
isolated alpha-helical or beta-hairpin folds within their RNA major-groove 
targets, without the necessity of additional appendages for anchorage within the 
binding pocket. The RNA peptide-binding pocket architectures are sculptured 
through precisely positioned mismatches, triples and looped-out bases, which 
accommodate amino acid sidechains through hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding and 
ionic intermolecular contacts. By contrast, protein modules associated with the 
HIV-1 nucleocapsid and MS2 phage coat target their RNA binding sites through the 
insertion of specificity-determining RNA base residues within conserved 
hydrophobic pockets and crevices on the protein surface, with the bases anchored 
through hydrogen bonding interactions. These alternative strategies of RNA 
recognition at the peptide and protein module level provide novel insights into 
the principles, patterns and diversity of the adaptive transitions associated 
with the recognition process.

Bacteriophage inactivation at the air-water-solid interface in dynamic batch 
systems.

California 92521, USA.

Bacteriophages have been widely used as surrogates for human enteric viruses in 
many studies on virus transport and fate. In this investigation, the fates of 
three bacteriophages, MS2, R17, and phiX174, were studied in a series of dynamic 
batch experiments. Both MS2 and R17 readily underwent inactivation in batch 
experiments where solutions of each phage were percolated through tubes packed 
with varying ratios of glass and Teflon beads. MS2 and R17 inactivation was the 
result of exposure to destructive forces at the dynamic air-water-solid 
interface. phiX174, however, did not undergo inactivation in similar studies, 
suggesting that this phage does not accumulate at air-water interfaces or is not 
affected by interfacial forces in the same manner. Other batch experiments 
showed that MS2 and R17 were increasingly inactivated during mixing in 
polypropylene tubes as the ionic strength of the solution was raised (phiX174 
was not affected). By the addition of Tween 80 to suspensions of MS2 and R17, 
phage inactivation was prevented. Our data suggest that viral inactivation in 
simple dynamic batch experiments is dependent upon (i) the presence of a dynamic 
air-water-solid interface (where the solid is a hydrophobic surface), (ii) the 
ionic strength of the solution, (iii) the concentration of surface active 
compounds in the solution, and (iv) the type of virus used.

A genomic library of Mycoplasma synoviae (MS) was generated by using 
bacteriophage lambda gt11 as a cloning and expression vector. Identification of 
recombinant clones highly specific to MS was achieved by screening the library 
for expression of MS proteins with polyclonal antiserum that had been 
preadsorbed with 6 heterologous avian mycoplasma species antigens. Expression of 
the recombinant clones in Escherichia coli followed by sodium dodecyl 
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the total cell lysates and 
immunoblot yielded a predominant reactive fusion protein of 165 kD. Two clones 
(MS2/28 and MS2/12) that yielded inserts of different size were selected. The 2 
MS DNA inserts were subcloned in a plasmid vector, labeled with digoxigenin, and 
used as probes for the specific recognition of several MS strains. A high degree 
of conservation was demonstrated for the MS2/12 and MS2/28 genes in tested MS 
strains. In addition, neither DNA fragment recognized any other avian mycoplasma 
species (M. gallisepticum, M. meleagridis, M. gallinarum, M. iners, M. anatis, 
and M. iowae), thus indicating their high specificity to MS. The sensitivity of 
the slot blot hybridization method using digoxigenin-labeled MS2/12 and MS2/28 
probes for direct detection of MS from broth cultures of field isolates was 
10(5) colony-forming units/ml. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of 
adsorbed antisera for the isolation of species-specific mycoplasma DNA and the 
potential for its use as probes for the specific and direct detection of MS from 
broth cultures of field isolates.

Identification of immunodominant epitopes in the filamentous hemagglutinin of 
Bordetella pertussis.

The filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) of Bordetella pertussis is a principal 
adhesin, which plays a key role in the colonization of the upper respiratory 
tract. FHA is also a protective antigen, which has been incorporated in the new 
generation of acellular vaccines against whooping cough. The protein is 
synthesized as a large 367-kDa precursor, which is then processed into a 220-kDa 
secreted polypeptide. To optimize the use of this protein for vaccine purposes 
it would be helpful to define the regions encompassing immunodominant epitopes. 
Twelve recombinant plasmids have been generated encoding fusion proteins between 
fragments of the matured-secreted 220-kDa form of FHA and the vector-encoded 
phage MS2 polymerase. Protein extracts of the resulting recombinant clones have 
been tested for reactivity with sera from 20 patients convalescent from whooping 
cough, and two human standard sera. The results indicate the presence of an 
immunodominant B cell epitope in the polypeptide coded by a 1-kb DNA fragment 
encompassing positions 5781-6800 of the published sequence. These results 
suggest that the identified fragment should be conserved in the formulation of 
vaccines against pertussis.

The limits of specificity: an experimental analysis with RNA aptamers to MS2 
coat protein variants.

It has been hypothesized that selections for aptamers with high affinity for a 
given target molecule will of necessity identify aptamers that have high 
specificity for that target. We have attempted to assess this hypothesis by 
selecting aptamers that can bind to MS2 coat protein or to single- or 
double-substitution variants of the coat protein. Some aptamers selected to bind 
MS2 coat protein or its variants were mildly specific for their cognate targets, 
discriminating by two- to fourfold against closely related proteins. Specificity 
determinants on both the coat proteins and the aptamers could be identified. 
However, many aptamers could readily bind to each of the different coat 
proteins. The identification of such aptamer 'generalists' belies the proposed 
relationship between the affinities and specificities of selected RNA ligands. 
These results imply that, while aptamers may not finely discriminate between 
closely related targets, neither will their binding be negated by mutations in 
targets. Aptamer pharmaceuticals may therefore better resist the evolution of 
resistance.

Asymmetric contributions to RNA binding by the Thr(45) residues of the MS2 coat 
protein dimer.

A prominent feature of the interaction of MS2 coat protein with RNA is the 
quasi-symmetric insertion of a bulged adenine (A-10) and a loop adenine (A-4) 
into conserved pockets on each subunit of the coat protein dimer. Because of its 
presence in both of these adenine-binding pockets, Thr(45) is thought to play an 
important role in interaction with RNA on both subunits of the dimer. To test 
the significance of Thr(45), we introduced all 19 amino acid substitutions. 
However, we were initially unable to determine the effects of the mutations on 
RNA binding because every substitution compromised the ability of coat protein 
to fold correctly. Genetic fusion of coat protein subunits reverted these 
protein structural defects, allowing us to show that the RNA binding activity of 
coat protein tolerates substitution of Thr(45), but only on one or the other 
subunit of the dimer. Single-chain heterodimer complementation experiments 
suggest that the primary site of Thr(45) interaction with RNA is with A-4 in the 
translational operator. Either contact of Thr(45) with A-10 makes little 
contribution to stability of the RNA-protein complex, or the effects of Thr(45) 
substitution are offset by conformational adjustments that introduce new, 
favorable contacts at nearby sites.

In vivo oligo(A) insertions in phage MS2: role of Escherichia coli poly(A) 
polymerase.

Previously we introduced an RNase III site into the genome of RNA phage MS2 by 
extending a hairpin with a perfect 18 bp long stem. One way in which the phage 
escaped from being killed by RNase III cleavage was to incorporate uncoded A 
residues on either side of the stem. This oligo(A) stretch interrupts the 
perfect stem that forms the RNase III site and thus confers resistance. In this 
paper we have analyzed the origin of these uncoded adenosines. The data strongly 
suggest that they are added by the host enzyme poly(A) polymerase. Apparently 
the 3'-OH created by RNase III cleavage becomes a substrate for poly(A) 
polymerase. Subsequently, MS2 replicase makes one contiguous copy from the two 
parts of the genome RNA. The evolutionary conversion from RNase III sensitivity 
to resistance provides a large spectrum of solutions that could be an important 
tool to understand what essentially constitutes an RNase III site in vivo.

Expression and immunogenicity of a liver stage malaria epitope presented as a 
foreign peptide on the surface of RNA-free MS2 bacteriophage capsids.

We have designed a novel vaccine strategy which enables display of short 
peptides expressed from chimeras of the gene encoding the coat protein of the 
RNA bacteriophage MS2 and inserted foreign DNA. MS2 coat protein has a 
beta-hairpin loop at the N-terminus which forms the most radially distinct 
feature of the mature capsid. The coat protein gene was modified to enable 
insertion of DNA at the central part of the beta-hairpin loop. Upon expression 
of the recombinant gene in E. coli, the MS2 coat protein subunits self-assemble 
into capsids, each comprising 180 copies of the monomer. This system was used to 
produce chimeras containing a putatively protective epitope, T1, from the 
immunodominant liver stage antigen-1 (LSA-1) of the malaria parasite Plasmodium 
falciparum. The immunogenicity of the native MS2 capsid and the recombinant 
construct was investigated in BALB/c (H-2(d)) mice. The native protein appeared 
to elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses, observed as a predominance 
of type 2 cytokines but with a mixed profile of immunoglobulin isotypes. In 
contrast, the LSA-1 chimera stimulated a type 1-polarised response, with 
significant upregulation of interferon-gamma, a finding which corroborates 
naturally acquired resistance to liver stage malaria. These results validate RNA 
phage capsid display of immunogenic determinants as a basis for the development 
of novel peptide vaccines and indicate that further evaluation of MS2 coat 
protein as a vector for malaria epitopes is merited.

The elimination of human viruses, phages, bacteria and Cryptosporidium oocysts 
by a new generation commercial Aquaguard purifier for the domestic treatment of 
drinking water, has been evaluated. The unit basically consists of a candle 
prefilter, activated carbon filter and ultraviolet irradiation compartment. 
Drinking water seeded with selected laboratory test strains of resistant 
micro-organisms was passed through the unit. Similar tests were carried out with 
sewage-contaminated river water and secondary treated waste water containing 
naturally occurring organisms. Test procedures were based on internationally 
accepted principles for the evaluation of point-of-use water treatment units, 
including a standard test protocol of the United States Environmental Protection 
Agency. Reduction in numbers of seeded test organisms at several log levels 
higher than those expected in water for which the unit is intended, was 
determined by the cultivation of viable organisms. In the case of seeded viruses 
and Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts the qualitative absence of nucleic acid was 
determined by the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). At 
the design flow rate of one litre per minute, numbers of polio, hepatitis A, 
adeno types 2 and 41, rota SA11, human rota and astro viruses, as well as 
somatic and MS2 coliphages, and Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, 
Clostridium perfringens, total coliform bacteria, enterococci, heterotrophic 
bacteria and C. parvum oocysts, were reduced by more than 99.999% in all waters 
tested. This efficiency conforms to specifications for such units. The quality 
of the treated water was well within microbiological limits of international 
specifications for drinking water.

RNA aptamers for the MS2 bacteriophage coat protein and the wild-type RNA 
operator have similar solution behaviour.

Sciences, University of Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, UK.

We have probed the effects of altering buffer conditions on the behaviour of two 
aptamer RNAs for the bacterio-phage MS2 coat protein using site-specific 
substitution of 2'-deoxy-2-aminopurine nucleotides at key adenosine positions. 
These have been compared to the wild-type operator stem-loop oligonucleotide, 
which is the natural target for the coat protein. The fluorescence emission 
spectra show a position and oligonucleotide sequence dependence which appears to 
reflect local conformational changes. These are largely similar between the 
differing oligonucleotides and deviations can be explained by the individual 
features of each sequence. Recognition by coat protein is enhanced, unaffected 
or decreased depending on the site of substitution, consistent with the known 
protein-RNA contacts seen in crystal structures of the complexes. These data 
suggest that the detailed conformational dynamics of aptamers and wild-type RNA 
ligands for the same protein target are remarkably similar.

Since temperature affects the inactivation rate of viruses in natural water 
systems, the aim of this study was to determine if a temperature shift could 
influence the structural integrity of model viruses. When crude lysates of MS-2 
phage were seeded into groundwater microcosms and incubated at 27 degrees C, 
complete virus inactivation took place in eight days. The temperature was then 
shifted to 4 degrees C. Three days after the temperature shift, a two-log 
increase in virus titer (reactivation) occurred. However, when purified MS-2 
lysates were added to groundwater microcosms, no reactivation was obtained. No 
reactivation of poliovirus took place when similar microcosm experiments were 
done. The sedimentation coefficients of MS-2 shifted from 80S to 58S, 48S, 37S, 
32S, and 18S as inactivation proceeded in groundwater and distilled water 
controls. Similarly, the sedimentation coefficients of polioviruses changed from 
156S to 142S, 135S, 117S, 105S, 95S, and 80 S as inactivation took place. There 
was no correlation between % virus inactivation and % decrease in virions with 
intact sedimentation coefficients, as reported earlier for poliovirus 
inactivated by chlorine. The results presented support our hypothesis that virus 
inactivation proceeds gradually, involving the rearrangement and (or) loss of 
capsomere components that may eventually lead to the ejection of nucleic acids. 
The intermediate particles generated as inactivation proceeds may be in a 
reversibly inactivated state, and may revert back to a fully infectious state 
when chemical components stabilize the virus particle.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the incidence of enteric viruses in 
mussels and to verify the possibility of using phages as indirect indicators of 
mussel viral contamination. Mussels (36 samples) collected from three different 
areas of the Adriatic Sea were analysed to determine the following parameters: 
Escherichia coli, somatic coliphage (T6 phage), F-Plus (MS2 phage), B40-8 (phage 
of Bacteroides fragilis), enteroviruses and hepatitis A virus. Most of the 
results of the bacteriological analysis (most probable number (MPN) ml-1) were 
in accordance with the bacteriological limits established by European law, with 
the exception of seven samples. The bacteriophage analyses were always negative 
for F-Plus and B40-8, with the exception of a few samples, whereas the somatic 
coliphages were generally between 0 and 20 MPN g-1, with the exception of two 
samples (110 MPN g-1). The virological analysis showed five samples positive for 
the presence of enteroviruses and 13 for the presence of hepatitis A virus (in 
three samples both viruses were present). Most of these samples presented 
acceptable bacteriological parameters and the bacteriophages were absent or 
their value was generally very low. The results show that the detection of E. 
coli and phages does not seem to be a good indicator of viral contamination.

Structure determination of bacteriophage PP7 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa: from 
poor data to a good map.

The structure of bacteriophage PP7 from Pseudomomas aeruginosa was determined to 
3.7 A resolution. Triclinic crystals of three forms were obtained, diffracting 
to between 4.5 and 3.4 A resolution. The quality of the crystals was 
exceptionally poor, leading to problems in the evaluation of the recorded images 
and to a final data set which would appear to be useless with standard criteria 
for protein crystals. In all crystal forms, the unit cell contains two 
icosahedral particles, providing 120-fold non-crystallographic symmetry. For two 
of the crystal forms, the particle orientations were calculated using the 
self-rotation function. The two particles in the asymmetric unit had very 
similar but distinct orientations. The position of the second particle was found 
using the Patterson function. Initial phases to 15 A resolution were calculated 
using the related phage MS2 as a model. Real-space averaging was performed and 
phases were extended from 15 A resolution to the limit of the data. The map was 
improved significantly by using only the 'high' resolution data in the 
resolution range 7-3.7 A, allowing the positions of most side chains to be 
determined. The better quality of the 7-3.7 A resolution map is presumably a 
consequence of the presence of satellite crystals. The position of the second 
particle was improved using the correlation coefficient in the averaging process 
to monitor the refinement by moving the particle around in small steps.

Phosphorothioate substitution can substantially alter RNA conformation.

Smith JS(1), Nikonowicz EP.

Author information:
(1)Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Rice University, Houston, Texas 
77005, USA.

Phosphorothioate substitution-interference experiments, routinely used to 
stereospecifically identify phosphoryl oxygen sites that participate in 
RNA-ligand binding and RNA-directed catalysis, rest in their interpretation on 
the untested assumption that substitution does not alter the conformation of the 
modified molecule from its biologically active state. Using NMR spectroscopy, we 
have tested this assumption by determining the structural effect of 
stereospecific phosphorothioate substitution at five positions in an RNA hairpin 
containing the binding site for bacteriophage MS2 capsid protein. At most sites, 
substitution has little or no effect, causing minor perturbations in the 
phosphate backbone and increasing the stacking among nucleotides in the hairpin 
loop. At one site, however, phosphorothioate substitution causes an unpaired 
adenine necessary for formation of the capsid protein-RNA complex to loop out of 
the RNA helix into the major groove. These results indicate that 
phosphorothioate substitution can substantially alter the conformation of RNA at 
positions of irregular secondary structure, complicating the use of 
substitution-interference experiments to study RNA structure and function.

The capability for sensitive and accurate identification of microorganisms has 
potential applications that include the monitoring of industrial bioprocessing 
operations, food safety analyses, disease diagnosis, and detection of potential 
biological hazards. Efforts based upon matrix-assisted laser 
desorption/ionization mass spectrometry to detect and identify specific 
microorganisms have been actively pursued for several years. We report a new 
method being developed to select useful biomarkers for the identification of 
microorganisms based upon electrospray ionization (ESI)-ion trap mass 
spectrometry. Crude cell lysates are processed using a recently developed 
dualmicrodialysis device and then directly infused into an ion trap MS. The low 
ESI flow rate and precursor ion accumulation capability of the ion trap MS 
enables high-sensitivity MS/MS analyses. Precursor ions are automatically 
selected and analyzed using tandem MS (MS/MS) to produce "global" MS/MS surveys 
and processed to yield two-dimensional MS/MS spectral displays. Such global 
MS/MS surveys are demonstrated for Escherichia coli lysates. The distinctive 
MS/MS spectral patterns can be used to identify mass spectrometric-detected 
species useful as biomarkers, which then provide a basis for confident 
microorganism identification. The results presented demonstrate the application 
of this method for the identification of microorganisms, as well as for 
detection of bacteriophage MS2 in the presence of a large excess of E. coli.

Forced retroevolution of an RNA bacteriophage.

Riga, LV 1067, Latvia.

The operator hairpin ahead of the replicase gene in RNA bacteriophage MS2 
contains overlapping signals for binding the coat protein and ribosomes. Coat 
protein binding inhibits further translation of the gene and forms the first 
step in capsid formation. The hairpin sequence was partially randomized to 
assess the importance of this structure element for the bacteriophage and to 
monitor alternative solutions that would evolve on the passaging of mutant 
phages. The evolutionary reconstruction of the operator failed in the majority 
of mutants. Instead, a poor imitation developed containing only some of the 
recognition signals for the coat protein. Three mutants were of particular 
interest in that they contained double nonsense codons in the lysis reading 
frame that runs through the operator hairpin. The simultaneous reversion of two 
stop codons into sense codons has a very low probability of occurring. Therefore 
the phage solved the problem by deleting the nonsense signals and, in fact, the 
complete operator, except for the initiation codon of the replicase gene. 
Several revertants were isolated with activities ranging from 1% to 20% of wild 
type. The operator, long thought to be a critical regulator, now appears to be a 
dispensable element. In addition, the results indicate how RNA viruses can be 
forced to step back to an attenuated form.

The three-dimensional structure of phage PP7 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa has 
been determined to 3.7-A resolution. A comparison with distantly related small 
RNA phages showed that the biggest differences were found in the FG loops, 
forming the contacts around the fivefold and threefold axes. In contrast to the 
situation in other phages, the FG loops of phage PP7 are very similar in all 
three subunits. This supports the hypothesis that no switches are needed for the 
assembly control in these viruses. Some of the most conserved residues lie 
within the region involved in RNA binding in the related phages MS2 and seem to 
have the same function.

Influence of salts on virus adsorption to microporous filters.

Gainesville, Florida 32611-0700, USA. george@micro.ifas.ufl.edu

We investigated the direct and indirect effects of mono-, di-, and trivalent 
salts (NaCl, MgCl(2), and AlCl(3)) on the adsorption of several viruses (MS2, 
PRD-1, phiX174, and poliovirus 1) to microporous filters at different pH values. 
The filters studied included Millipore HA (nitrocellulose), Filterite 
(fiberglass), Whatman (cellulose), and 1MDS (charged-modified fiber) filters. 
Each of these filters except the Whatman cellulose filters has been used in 
virus removal and recovery procedures. The direct effects of added salts were 
considered to be the effects associated with the presence of the soluble salts. 
The indirect effects of the added salts were considered to be (i) changes in the 
pH values of solutions and (ii) the formation of insoluble precipitates that 
could adsorb viruses and be removed by filtration. When direct effects alone 
were considered, the salts used in this study promoted virus adsorption, 
interfered with virus adsorption, or had little or no effect on virus 
adsorption, depending on the filter, the virus, and the salt. Although we were 
able to confirm previous reports that the addition of aluminum chloride to water 
enhances virus adsorption to microporous filters, we found that the enhanced 
adsorption was associated with indirect effects rather than direct effects. The 
increase in viral adsorption observed when aluminum chloride was added to water 
was related to the decrease in the pH of the water. Similar results could be 
obtained by adding HCl. The increased adsorption of viruses in water at pH 7 
following addition of aluminum chloride was probably due to flocculation of 
aluminum, since removal of flocs by filtration greatly reduced the enhancement 
observed. The only direct effect of aluminum chloride on virus adsorption that 
we observed was interference with adsorption to microporous filters. Under 
conditions under which hydrophobic interactions were minimal, aluminum chloride 
interfered with virus adsorption to Millipore, Filterite, and 1MDS filters. In 
most cases, less than 10% of the viruses adsorbed to filters in the presence of 
a multivalent salt and a compound that interfered with hydrophobic interactions 
(0.1% Tween 80 or 4 M urea).

València, Spain.

RNA viruses show the highest mutation rate in nature. It has been extensively 
demonstrated that, in the absence of purifying selection, RNA viruses accumulate 
deleterious mutations at a high rate. However, the parameters describing this 
accumulation are, in general, poorly understood. The present study reports 
evidences for fitness declines by the accumulation of deleterious mutations in 
the bacteriophage MS2. We estimated the rate of fitness decline to be as high as 
16% per bottleneck transfer. In addition, our results agree with an additive 
model of fitness effects.

Suppression of the humoral immune response of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L. by 
the 64 kDa serine protease of Aeromonas salmonicida.

Bacteria-free supernatants of broth cultures of Aeromonas salmonicida inhibited 
the humoral immune response, but not the cell-mediated immune response, of 
Atlantic salmon to bacteriophage MS2. The immunosuppressive factor was the 64 
kDa serine protease secreted by A. salmonicida. The suppressive activity was not 
due to degradation of epitopes of MS2, and although serine protease degraded the 
heavy chain of salmon IgM in vitro there was no evidence for significant 
degradation in vivo. The principal lethal toxin of A. salmonicida, the 
glycerophospholipid: cholesterol acyltransferase did not inhibit the immune 
response of salmon.

General effect of Sam68 on Rev/Rex regulated expression of complex retroviruses.

California, CA 92093-0665, USA.

We have previously demonstrated that overexpression of Sam68 functionally 
substitutes for, as well as synergizes with, HIV-1 Rev in RRE-mediated gene 
expression and virus replication. In addition, C-terminal deletion mutants of 
Sam68 exhibit a transdominant negative phenotype in HIV replication. We now 
report that Sam68 also enhances the activities of Rev-like proteins of other 
complex retroviruses (e.g. HTLV-1 and EIAV) on their respective RNA targets. 
Furthermore, we demonstrate that Sam68 can function alone as well as synergize 
with Rev-MS2 and/or Rex-MS2 chimeric proteins on expression mediated by the 
corresponding RRE-MS2 fusion RNA element. Additionally, dominant negative 
mutants of Sam68 also repressed the synergistic activation of Sam68 with Rex, 
E-Rev, and/or Rev-MS2/Rex-MS2 on their corresponding RNA targets. Thus, Sam68 
may play an important role in the post-transcriptional regulation of all complex 
retroviruses. Oncogene (2000) 19, 4071 - 4074

Interactions of Escherichia coli RNA with bacteriophage MS2 coat protein: 
genomic SELEX.

Genomic SELEX is a method for studying the network of nucleic acid-protein 
interactions within any organism. Here we report the discovery of several 
interesting and potentially biologically important interactions using genomic 
SELEX. We have found that bacteriophage MS2 coat protein binds several 
Escherichia coli mRNA fragments more tightly than it binds the natural, 
well-studied, phage mRNA site. MS2 coat protein binds mRNA fragments from rffG 
(involved in formation of lipopolysaccharide in the bacterial outer membrane), 
ebgR (lactose utilization repressor), as well as from several other genes. 
Genomic SELEX may yield experimentally induced artifacts, such as molecules in 
which the fixed sequences participate in binding. We describe several methods 
(annealing of oligonucleotides complementary to fixed sequences or switching 
fixed sequences) to eliminate some, or almost all, of these artifacts. Such 
methods may be useful tools for both randomized sequence SELEX and genomic 
SELEX.

Probing the kinetics of formation of the bacteriophage MS2 translational 
operator complex: identification of a protein conformer unable to bind RNA.

Sciences, University of Leeds, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK.

We have investigated the kinetics of complex formation between bacteriophage MS2 
coat protein subunits and synthetic RNA fragments encompassing the natural 
translational operator site, or the consensus sequences of three distinct RNA 
aptamer families, which are known to bind to the same site on the protein. 
Reactions were assayed using stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy and either 
the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the protein or the signals from RNA 
fragments site-specifically substituted with the fluorescent adenosine analogue 
2'-deoxy, 2-aminopurine. The kinetics observed were independent of the 
fluorophore being monitored or its position within the complex, indicating that 
the data report global events occurring during complex formation. Competition 
assays show that the complex being formed consists of a single coat protein 
dimer and one RNA molecule. The binding reaction is at least biphasic. The 
faster phase, constituting 80-85 % of the amplitude, is a largely diffusion 
driven RNA-protein interaction (k1 approximately 2x10(9) M(-1) s(-1)). The salt 
dependence of the forward reaction and the similarities of the on-rates of 
lower-affinity RNA fragments are consistent with a diffusion-controlled step 
dominated by electrostatic steering. The slower phase is independent of reactant 
concentration, and appears to correspond to isomerisation of the coat protein 
subunit(s) prior to RNA binding (k(iso) approximately 0.23 s(-1)). Measurements 
with a coat protein mutant (Pro78Asn) show that this phase is not due to 
cis-trans isomerisation at this residue. The conformational changes in the 
protein ligand during formation of an RNA-protein complex might play a role in 
the triggering of capsid self-assembly and a model for this is discussed.

Deletions near the N-terminus of HIV-1 Rev reduce RNA binding affinity and 
dominantly interfere with Rev function irrespective of the RNA target.

Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-1576, USA.

The contributions of the near N-terminal residues of Rev protein of HIV were 
investigated by analyzing N-terminal deletions of Rev in the context of a 
Rev/MS-C fusion protein that can bind and activate both the Rev responsive 
element (RRE) and the MS2 phage translational operator RNAs. Rev/MS-C fusion 
proteins deleted for residues 3-19 of Rev retained trans-activation potential 
for both RRE and MS2 targets. Coincidentally, peptides spanning residues 17-87 
or 22-85 were functionally competent for trans-activation of RRE containing 
HIV-1 gag mRNA. Deletion of residues 18-24 of Rev in the Rev/MS-C fusion protein 
abolished the activation potential for both RRE and MS2 targets, although this 
mutant was competent for specific RNA binding, protein multimerization, and 
nuclear and nucleolar localization. Four mutants dominantly interfering with Rev 
activation of RRE were mapped near the N-terminus of Rev; (i) between residues 
18 and 24, (ii) 25-34, (iii) 43-50, and (iv) 51-60. Of these, the mutant lacking 
residues 18-24 was a novel trans-dominant inhibitor of Rev and Rev/MS-C for 
activation of RRE or MS2 RNA, while the oligomerization domain mutants mapping 
between residues 25-34 or 51-60 inhibited the activation of RRE rather than MS2 
RNA.

Exchange of the basic domain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Rev for a 
polyarginine stretch expands the RNA binding specificity, and a minimal arginine 
cluster is required for optimal RRE RNA binding affinity, nuclear accumulation, 
and trans-activation.

Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, 
USA.

The Rev regulatory protein of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) facilitates the 
nuclear export of unspliced and partially spliced HIV RNAs. Using a Rev:MS2 
phage coat protein fusion that could be targeted to bind and activate the 
Rev-responsive element (RRE) RNA or heterologous MS2 phage operator RNA, we 
analyzed the role(s) of the arginine-rich RNA binding domain in RNA binding and 
transactivation. The arginine-rich domain could be functionally replaced by a 
stretch of nine arginines. However, polyarginine substitutions expanded the RNA 
binding specificity of the resultant mutant Rev protein. Polyarginine insertions 
in place of residues 24 to 60 that excised the RNA binding and oligomerization 
domains of Rev preserved the activation for MS2 RNA, but not for the RRE. A 
nine-arginine insertion outside of the natural context of the Rev nuclear 
localization signal domain was incompatible with activation of either RNA 
target. Insertions of fewer than eight arginines impaired RRE activation. 
Interrupted lysine clusters and disruption of the arginine stretch with lysine 
or neutral residues resulted in a similar phenotype. Some of these mutants with 
a null phenotype for RRE activated the heterologous MS2 RNA target. Under 
steady-state conditions, mutants that preserved the Rev response for RRE RNA 
localized to the nuclei; those with poor or no Rev response accumulated mostly 
in the cytoplasm. Many of the cytoplasmically resident derivatives became 
nuclear when leptomycin B (LMB) treatment inhibited nuclear export of nuclear 
export signal-containing proteins. Mutants that had a null activation potential 
for either RNA target were particularly resistant to LMB treatment. Abbreviated 
nuclear residence times and differences in RRE binding affinity may have 
compromised their activation potential for RRE. High-affinity binding to MS2 RNA 
through the intact coat protein was sufficient to overcome the short nuclear 
residence times and to facilitate MS2 activation by some derivatives.

Bacteriophage of the family Leviviridae have played an important role in 
molecular biology where representative species, such as Q beta and MS2, have 
been studied as model systems for replication, translation, and the role of 
secondary structure in gene regulation. Using nucleotide sequences from the coat 
and replicase genes we present the first statistical estimate of phylogeny for 
the family Leviviridae using maximum-likelihood and Bayesian estimation. Our 
analyses reveal that the coliphage species are a monophyletic group consisting 
of two clades representing the genera Levivirus and Allolevivirus. The 
Pseudomonas species PP7 diverged from its common ancestor with the coliphage 
prior to the ancient split between these genera and their subsequent 
diversification. Differences in genome size, gene composition, and gene 
expression are shown with a high probability to have changed along the lineage 
leading to the Allolevivirus through gene expansion. The change in genome size 
of the Allolevivirus ancestor may have catalyzed subsequent changes that led to 
their current genome organization and gene expression.

Four three-dimensional lysimeters were established in a pilot laboratory with 
the same medium sand and either an aggregate-laden (AL) or aggregate-free (AF) 
infiltration surface and a 60- or 90-cm soil vadose zone depth to ground water. 
During 48 weeks of operation, each lysimeter was dosed 4 times daily with septic 
tank effluent (STE) at 5 cm/d (AL) or 8.4 cm/d (AF). Weekly monitoring was done 
to characterize the STE, percolate flow and composition, and water content 
distributions within the lysimeters. Bromide tracer tests were completed at 
weeks 0, 8, and 45 and during the latter two times, ice nucleating active (INA) 
bacteria and MS-2 and PRD-1 bacteriophages were used as bacterial and viral 
surrogates. After 48 weeks, soil cores were collected and analyzed for chemical 
and microbial properties. The observations made during this study revealed a 
dynamic, interactive behavior for hydraulic and purification processes that were 
similar for all four lysimeters. Media utilization and bromide retention times 
increased during the first two months of operation with the median bromide 
breakthrough exceeding one day at start-up and increasing to two days or more. 
Purification processes were gradually established over four months or longer, 
after which there were high removal efficiencies (>90%) for organic 
constituents, microorganisms, and virus, but only limited removal of nutrients. 
Soil core analyses revealed high biogeochemical activity within the infiltrative 
zone from 0 to 15 cm depth. All four lysimeters exhibited comparable behavior 
and there were no significant differences in performance attributable to 
infiltrative surface character or soil depth. It is speculated that the 
comparable performance is due to a similar and sufficient degree of soil 
clogging genesis coupled with bioprocesses that effectively purified the 
wastewater effluent given the adequate retention times and high volumetric 
utilization's of the sand media.

Identification of bacteriophage MS2 coat protein from E. coli lysates via ion 
trap collisional activation of intact protein ions.

Collisional activation of the intact MS2 viral capsid protein with subsequent 
ion/ion reactions has been used to identify the presence of this virus in E. 
coli lysates. Tandem ion trap mass spectrometry experiments on the +7, +8, and 
+9 charge states, followed by ion/ion reactions, provided the necessary sequence 
tag information (and molecular weight data) needed for protein identification 
via database searching. The most directly informative structural information is 
obtained from those charge states that produce a series of product ions arising 
from fragmentation at adjacent residues. The formation of these product ions via 
dissociation at adjacent amino acid residues depends greatly on the charge state 
of the parent ion. Database searching of the charge-state-specific sequence tags 
was performed by two different search engines: the ProteinInfo program from the 
Protein information Retrieval On-line World Wide Web Lab or PROWL and the 
TagIdent program from the ExPASy molecular biology server. These search engines 
were used in conjunction with the sequence tag information generated via 
collisional activation of the intact viral coat protein. These programs were 
used to evaluate the feasibility of generating sequence tags from collisional 
activation of intact multiply charged protein ions in a quadrupole ion trap.

Translational repression and specific RNA binding by the coat protein of the 
Pseudomonas phage PP7.

School of Medicine, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87131, USA.

PP7 is a single-strand RNA bacteriophage of Pseudomonas aeroginosa and a distant 
relative to coliphages like MS2 and Qbeta. Here we show that PP7 coat protein is 
a specific RNA-binding protein, capable of repressing the translation of 
sequences fused to the translation initiation region of PP7 replicase. Its RNA 
binding activity is specific since it represses the translational operator of 
PP7, but does not repress the operators of the MS2 or Qbeta phages. Conditions 
for the purification of coat protein and for the reconstitution of its RNA 
binding activity from disaggregated virus-like particles were established. Its 
dissociation constant for PP7 operator RNA in vitro was determined to be about 1 
nm. Using a genetic system in which coat protein represses translation of a 
replicase-beta-galactosidase fusion protein, amino acid residues important for 
binding of PP7 RNA were identified.

Translational control by delayed RNA folding: identification of the kinetic 
trap.

van Meerten D(1), Girard G, van Duin J.

Author information:
(1)Leiden Institute of Chemistry, Department of Biochemistry, Leiden University, 
The Netherlands.

The maturation or A-protein gene of single-stranded RNA phage MS2 is preceded by 
a 130-nt long untranslated leader. When MS2 RNA folding is at equilibrium, the 
gene is untranslatable because the leader adopts a well-defined cloverleaf 
structure in which the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence of the maturation gene is 
taken up in long-distance base pairing with an upstream complementary sequence 
(UCS). Synthesis of the A-protein takes place transiently while the RNA is 
synthesized from the minus strand. This requires that formation of the 
inhibitory cloverleaf is slow. In vitro, the folding delay was on the order of 
minutes. Here, we present evidence that this postponed folding is caused by the 
formation of a metastable intermediate. This intermediate is a small local 
hairpin that contains the UCS in its loop, thereby preventing or slowing down 
its pairing with the SD sequence. Mutants in which the small hairpin could not 
be formed made no detectable amounts of A-protein and were barely viable. 
Apparently, here the cloverleaf formed quicker than ribosomes could bind. On the 
other hand, mutants in which the small intermediary hairpin was stabilized 
produced more A-protein than wild type and were viable. One hardly growing 
mutant that could not form the metastable hairpin and did not make detectable 
amounts of A-protein was evolved. The emerging pseudo-revertant had selected two 
second site repressor mutations that allowed reconstruction of a variant of the 
metastable intermediate. The pseudo-revertant had also regained the capacity to 
produce the A-protein.

Evaluation of methylphosphonates as analogs for detecting phosphate contacts in 
RNA-protein complexes.

Dertinger D(1), Uhlenbeck OC.

Author information:
(1)Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Colorado, Boulder 
80309-0215, USA.

The well-studied interaction between the MS2 coat protein and its cognate 
hairpin was used to test the utility of the methylphosphonate linkage as a 
phosphate analog. A nitrocellulose filter binding assay was used to measure the 
change in binding affinity upon introduction of a single methylphosphonate 
stereoisomer at 13 different positions in the RNA hairpin. Comparing these data 
to the available crystal structure of the complex shows that all phosphates that 
are in proximity to the protein show a weaker binding affinity when substituted 
with a phosphorothioate and control positions show no change. However, in two 
cases, a methylphosphonate isomer either increased or decreased the binding 
affinity where no interaction can be detected in the crystal structure. It is 
possible that methylphosphonate substitutions at these positions affect the 
structure or flexibility of the hairpin. The utility of the methylphosphonate 
substitution is compared to phosphate ethylation and phosphorothioate 
substitution experiments previously performed on the same system.

Peptide display on live MS2 phage: restrictions at the RNA genome level.

Laboratories, Leiden University, PO Box 9502, 2300 RA Leiden, The Netherlands1.

The potential of the RNA phage MS2 to accommodate extra amino acids in its major 
coat protein has been examined. Accordingly, a pentapeptide was encoded in the 
genome as an N-terminal extension. In the MS2 crystal structure, this part of 
the coat protein forms a loop that extends from the outer surface of the 
icosahedral virion. At the RNA level, the insert forms a large loop at the top 
of an existing hairpin. This study shows that it is possible to maintain inserts 
in the coat protein of live phages. However, not all inserts were genetically 
stable. Some suffer deletions, while others underwent adaptation by base 
substitutions. Whether or not an insert is stable appears to be determined by 
the choice of the nucleic acid sequence used to encode the extra peptide. This 
effect was not caused by differential translation, because coat-protein 
synthesis was equal in wild-type and mutants. We conclude that the stability of 
the insert depends on the structure of the large RNA hairpin loop, as 
demonstrated by the fact that a single substitution can convert an unstable loop 
into a stable one.

Persistence of two model enteric viruses (B40-8 and MS-2 bacteriophages) in

The persistence of two model enteric virions (Bacteroides fragilis phage B40-8 
and coliphage MS-2) within pipe biofilms was investigated in situ in an urban 
distribution system. Biofilms were allowed to develop on uPVC and stainless 
steel (SS) coupons in a modified Robbins' device for 70 d within a 150 mm uPVC 
reticulation main. Coupons were then placed in annular reactors and slug dosed 
with B40-8 and MS-2 phages (10(8) pfu/mL). Pipe water velocity, pH and free 
chlorine were recorded during the experimental period. Biofilms on uPVC were 
generally more abundant (based on total bacterial counts, HPCs, total protein 
and total carbohydrate). Both B40-8 and MS-2 were incorporated into biofilms 
formed on uPVC and SS coupons (> 10(4) and > 10(3) pfu/microgram protein 
respectively) and persisted for > 30 d and 6 d respectively, reflecting biofilm 
biomass on the two pipe surfaces. Virion loss/inactivation from biofilm followed 
an initial rapid phase, followed by a very slow phase representing approximately 
0.01% of the original virion population. Virions, therefore, have the potential 
to accumulate within distribution biofilm and problems could arise when clusters 
of biofilm-associated enteric virions become detached from the substrata by 
hydrodynamic forces or sudden changes in disinfection regime.

Our research aimed to evaluate intermittent soil infiltration of treated sewage 
for reuse in the north of Chile. Aerated lagoon effluent was infiltrated in 
columns packed with native soils (sandy-lime, lime-gravel and limey-sand). 
Columns were operated for more than a year under different cycles of filling and 
drying, depths and load pressures depending on soil characteristics. The 
efficiency of the system was determined through influent-effluent 
microbiological indicators level (faecal coliforms, E. coli, Salmonella spp, MS2 
phage, and protozoan cysts), physicochemical characterisation (TOC, COD, BOD, 
nitrogen), and hydraulic flow measurement. Results showed: (a) high reduction of 
enteric bacteria (5-7 log10), some inactivation of phage (2-4 log10) and 
complete removal of intestinal cyst; (b) stable removal of organic matter 
(80-90% reduction of TOC, COD, BOD); and (c) partial ammonia reduction through 
adsorption and nitrification with denitrification mainly occurring in sandy 
soil. Preliminary data from pilot plant working in the field showed better 
results that those obtained in the laboratory especially removal of 
microbiological indicators. Microbiological quality of effluent met Class A 
regulations for agricultural reuse (WHO, 1989) and the system looks like an 
attractive alternative to cope with water shortage in the region.

Thc inactivation behaviour of the bacteriophages PHI X 174 (ssDNA virus). MS2 
(ssRNA virus) and B40-8 (dsDNA) toward non-ionizing (UV-253.7 nm) as well as to 
ionizing radiation (gamma radiation) was studied in order to evaluate their 
potential as viral indicators for water disinfection by irradiation. Previous 
findings of the high UV-253.7 nm resistance of MS2 were confirmed whereas an 
unexpected high sensitivity to gamma radiation compared to the two other phages 
was found. On the other hand, PHI X 174 revealed an enhanced UV sensitivity but 
a high resistance to ionizing radiation. B40-8 had an intermediate position 
between the other two bacteriophages relative to both types of radiation. As 
expected, the data of E. coli reconfirmed the unreliability of fecal indicator 
bacteria for the purpose of predicting responses of viruses to water treatment. 
In UV disinfection the influence of water matrix may be adequately controlled by 
considering the UV (253.7 nm) absorption of the water whereas so far no such 
parameter has existed for the influence of the water quality on ionizing 
irradiation with respect to the scavenger concentration.

Manned exploration of Mars may result in the contamination of that planet with 
terrestrial microbes, a situation requiring assessment of the survival potential 
of possible contaminating organisms. In this study, the survival of Bacillius 
subtilis, Azotobacter chroococcum, and the enteric bacteriophage MS2 was 
examined in clays representing terrestrial (Wyoming type montmorillonite) or 
Martian (Fe(3+)-montmorillonite) soils exposed to terrestrial and Martian 
environmental conditions of temperature and atmospheric pressure and 
composition, but not to UV flux or oxidizing conditions. Survival of bacteria 
was determined by standard plate counts and biochemical and physiological 
measurements over 112 days. Extractable lipid phosphate was used to measure 
microbial biomass, and the rate of 14C-acetate incorporation into microbial 
lipids was used to determine physiological activity. MS2 survival was assayed by 
plaque counts. Both bacterial types survived terrestrial or Martian conditions 
in Wyoming montmorillonite better than Martian conditions in 
Fe(3+)-montmorillonite. Decreased survival may have been caused by the lower pH 
of the Fe(3+)-montmorillonite compared to Wyoming montmorillonite. MS2 survived 
simulated Mars conditions better than the terrestrial environment, likely due to 
stabilization of the virus caused by the cold and dry conditions of the 
simulated Martian environment. The survival of MS2 in the simulated Martian 
environment is the first published indication that viruses may be able to 
survive in Martian type soils. This work may have implications for planetary 
protection for future Mars missions.

Effect of microgravity on Escherichia coli and MS-2 bacteriophage disinfection 
by iodinated resins.

Experiments on chemical disinfection by iodinated resins were conducted on STS 
50 (USML-1), which flew a 13 day mission during 1992. Fluid processing apparatus 
containing microorganisms and iodinated resins was assembled in either 
Manhattan, Kansas, or Boulder, Colorado, and loaded on-board the Space Shuttle 
for the mission. Pentaiodide resin was more effective than the triiodide resin 
against Escherichia coli. Both resins were more effective bactericides at unit 
gravity than microgravity because of cosedimentation of bacteria and iodinated 
resin beads. In bacteriophage experiments, the triiodide resin reduced the 
viable titer of MS-2 by nine logs. The few viable phage surviving chemical 
disinfection were associated with precipitant formation in the fluid processing 
apparatus.

Principles of selective inactivation of a viral genome. Comparative kinetic 
study of modification of the viral RNA and model protein with oligoaziridines.

(1)Zelinskii Institute of Organic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, 
Moscow, 117913 Russia.

Comparative kinetic analysis of inactivation of bacteriophage MS2 infectivity 
and aminoalkylation of a model protein (trypsin inhibitor) with oligoaziridines 
was performed in order to evaluate the selectivity of viral RNA modification 
with oligocationic reagents. The transition from ethyleneimine monomer to di-, 
tri-, and tetramer leads to a sharp increase in the rate constant of infectivity 
inactivation, whereas the rate constant of protein modification changes 
insignificantly. The selectivity coefficient of the phage RNA aminoalkylation 
relative to trypsin inhibitor modification increases in this series by more than 
an order of magnitude. This effect is probably associated with the strengthening 
of the reagent binding to the nucleic acid, which implies a reaction mechanism 
that involves the formation of a reactive intermediate. The latter might be an 
electrostatic complex of the oligocationic reagent and RNA, the only polyanion 
in the virion. A pronounced decrease in the rate constant of infectivity 
inactivation in the presence of multiply charged anions (in phosphate buffer) 
and a biogenic polyamine (spermine) favors this hypothesis. Increasing the 
reaction temperature increases the rate constant of infectivity inactivation and 
decreases selectivity of the viral RNA modification.

Viral transport in a sand and gravel aquifer under field pumping conditions.

Ground water supplies contaminated with microbes cause more than 50% of the 
water-borne disease outbreaks in the United States. Proposed regulations suggest 
natural disinfection as a possible mechanism to treat microbe-impacted ground 
water under favorable conditions. However, the usefulness of current models 
employed to predict viral transport and natural attenuation rates is limited by 
the absence of field scale calibration data. At a remote floodplain aquifer in 
western Montana, the bacteriophages MS2, phiX174, and PRD1; attenuated 
poliovirus type-1 (CHAT strain); and bromide were seeded as a slug 21.5 m from a 
well pumping at a steady rate of 408 L/min. Over the 47-hour duration of the 
test, resulting in the exchange of 12 to 13 pore volumes, 77% of the bromide, 
55% of the PRD1, 17% of the MS2, 7% of the phiX174, and 0.12% of the poliovirus 
masses were recovered at the pumping well. Virus transport behavior was 
controlled by mechanical dispersion, preferential flow, time-dependent 
nonreversible and reversible attachment, and apparent mass transfer to immobile 
domains within the sand and gravel dominated aquifer. The percentage of virus 
recovery appears correlated with reported viral isoelectric point (pI) values. 
Successful modeling of viral transport in coarse-grained aquifers will require 
separation of viral specific properties from reported lumped viral-transport 
system parameters.

A method was developed to screen bacteria for synthesis of mutant proteins with 
altered assembly and solubility properties using bacteriophage MS2 coat protein 
as a model self-associating protein. Colonies expressing coat protein from a 
plasmid were covered with an agarose overlay under conditions that caused the 
lysis of some of the cells in each colony. The proteins thus liberated diffused 
through the overlay at rates depending on their molecular sizes. After transfer 
of the proteins to a nitrocellulose membrane, probing with coat protein-specific 
antiserum revealed spots whose sizes and intensities were related to the 
aggregation state of coat protein. The method was employed in the isolation of 
assembly defective mutants and to find soluble variants of an aggregation-prone 
coat protein mutant.

complex.

We have determined the X-ray structures of six MS2 RNA hairpin-coat-protein 
complexes having five different substitutions at the hairpin loop base -5. This 
is a uracil in the wild-type hairpin and contacts the coat protein both by 
stacking on to a tyrosine side chain and by hydrogen bonding to an asparagine 
side chain. The RNA consensus sequence derived from coat protein binding studies 
with natural sequence variants suggested that the -5 base needs to be a 
pyrimidine for strong binding. The five -5 substituents used in this study were 
5-bromouracil, pyrimidin-2-one, 2-thiouracil, adenine, and guanine. The 
structure of the 5-bromouracil complex was determined to 2.2 A resolution, which 
is the highest to date for any MS2 RNA-protein complex. All the complexes 
presented here show very similar conformations, despite variation in affinity in 
solution. The results suggest that the stacking of the -5 base on to the 
tyrosine side chain is the most important driving force for complex formation. A 
number of hydrogen bonds that are present in the wild-type complex are not 
crucial for binding, as they are missing in one or more of the complexes. The 
results also reveal the flexibility of this RNA-protein interface, with respect 
to functional group variation, and may be generally applicable to other 
RNA-protein complexes.

A rapid, simple, and direct (RSD) assay of eluate from filter concentration was 
developed to enumerate low numbers of MS2 bacteriophage, used as a surrogate for 
enteric viruses, from samples collected from a prototype-sized water recycling 
system. The RSD assay utilized a 50-ml eluate volume in a modified single-layer 
assay, neutralizing eluate pH by buffered, double-strength agar. The RSD assay 
developed was simpler and minimized sample-handling steps compared with another 
published method. The RSD assay method showed greater sensitivity than the other 
published method for recovering phage from filter eluate while avoiding pH 
shifts, which can inactivate phage. Grant numbers: NAGW 2356.

TaqMan 5'-nuclease human immunodeficiency virus type 1 PCR assay with 
phage-packaged competitive internal control for high-throughput blood donor 
screening.

Service, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.

Screening of blood donors for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) 
infection by PCR permits the earlier diagnosis of HIV-1 infection compared with 
that by serologic assays. We have established a high-throughput reverse 
transcription (RT)-PCR assay based on 5'-nuclease PCR. By in-tube detection of 
HIV-1 RNA with a fluorogenic probe, the 5'-nuclease PCR technology (TaqMan PCR) 
eliminates the risk of carryover contamination, a major problem in PCR testing. 
We outline the development and evaluation of the PCR assay from a technical 
point of view. A one-step RT-PCR that targets the gag genes of all known HIV-1 
group M isolates was developed. An internal control RNA detectable with a 
heterologous 5'-nuclease probe was derived from the viral target cDNA and was 
packaged into MS2 coliphages (Armored RNA). Because the RNA was protected 
against digestion with RNase, it could be spiked into patient plasma to control 
the complete sample preparation and amplification process. The assay detected 
831 HIV-1 type B genome equivalents per ml of native plasma (95% confidence 
interval [CI], 759 to 936 HIV-1 B genome equivalents per ml) with a >or=95% 
probability of a positive result, as determined by probit regression analysis. A 
detection limit of 1,195 genome equivalents per ml of (individual) donor plasma 
(95% CI, 1,014 to 1,470 genome equivalents per ml of plasma pooled from 
individuals) was achieved when 96 samples were pooled and enriched by 
centrifugation. Up to 4,000 plasma samples per PCR run were tested in a 3-month 
trial period. Although data from the present pilot feasibility study will have 
to be complemented by a large clinical validation study, the assay is a 
promising approach to the high-throughput screening of blood donors and is the 
first noncommercial test for high-throughput screening for HIV-1.

Certain formulations of nanoscale powders possess antimicrobial properties. 
These formulations are made of simple, nontoxic metal oxides such as magnesium 
oxide (MgO) and calcium oxide (CaO, lime) in nanocrystalline form, carrying 
active forms of halogens, for example, MgO. Cl2 and MgO. Br2. When these 
ultrafine powders contact vegetative cells of Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, 
or Bacillus globigii, over 90% are killed within a few minutes. Likewise, spore 
forms of the Bacillus species are decontaminated within several hours. Dry 
contact with aflatoxins and contact with MS2 bacteriophage (surrogate of human 
enterovirus) in water also causes decontamination in minutes.

Modifying the specificity of an RNA backbone contact.

80309-0215, USA.

The interaction between the MS2 bacteriophage coat protein homodimer and its 
cognate RNA hairpin is facilitated by 21 different RNA-protein contacts. In one 
of these contacts, the 2'-hydroxyl group at ribose -5 of the RNA acts as a 
hydrogen bond donor to Glu63 in one subunit of the protein. Previous experiments 
showed that substitution of ribose -5 with deoxyribose resulted in a 24-fold 
decrease in binding affinity between RNA and protein. Using a protein where the 
two MS2 monomers were fused to increase stability, the contribution of this 
contact to the overall binding affinity was investigated by site-directed 
mutagenesis. When Glu63 was substituted with glutamine, aspartate, or alanine, 
the binding affinity of the hairpin for the protein was weakened by 12 to 
100-fold, similar to that observed with deoxyribose at position -5. However, the 
specificity of the three mutant proteins for RNAs with various modifications at 
the 2'-position of ribose -5 differed dramatically. While the Glu63Asp protein 
resembled the wild-type protein in preferring the 2'-hydroxyl group over a 
proton or a bulky 2'-substituent, both the Glu63Ala and Glu63Gln proteins 
preferred bulky 2'-substituents over the 2'-hydroxyl group by more than 
100-fold. These experiments emphasize the ease with which the specificity of a 
protein-nucleic acid interaction can be changed at thermodynamically important 
sites.

Enteric bacteriophages as potential fecal indicators in ground beef and poultry 
meat.

Carolina, Chapel Hill 27599, USA. fuchih@ehl.ul.com

Recovery efficiencies of enteric bacteriophages (F+ RNA coliphages, somatic 
coliphages, and Salmonella phages) as alternative fecal indicators were 
determined from ground beef and chicken breast meat using amino acid eluants 
(glycine and threonine) and a complex eluant (3% beef extract). Levels of F+ RNA 
coliphages (MS2, GA, Qbeta, FI, and SP), the somatic coliphage phiX174, and 
three environmental isolates of Salmonella phages (isolated from raw sewage) 
were assayed using three respective hosts: Escherichia coli Famp, E. coli C, and 
Salmonella Typhimurium. When 8% polyethylene glycol and 0.1 M NaCl were used to 
precipitate bacteriophages eluted with five different eluants, the highest 
recoveries of the three phage groups were with 0.5 M threonine and 0.25 M 
glycine-threonine. The average recoveries of F+ RNA coliphages, somatic 
coliphages, and the Salmonella phages from ground beef and chicken meat were 
100, 69, and 65%, respectively, with threonine (0.5 M, pH 9.0) as the eluate. Of 
eight market food samples tested, F+ RNA coliphages were detected in five (63%) 
and somatic coliphages were detected in seven (88%). The overall detection 
sensitivity of the method was 3 PFU/100 g of ground beef or chicken meat. Levels 
of bacteriophages and bacterial indicators on chicken carcass surfaces were 
determined at identified critical control points at a poultry plant. Through the 
processing steps of evisceration, washing, and chilling, the levels of F+ RNA 
coliphages and fecal coliforms were reduced by 1.6 and 1.9 log10 PFU or CFU/100 
g, respectively. F+ RNA coliphages and perhaps other enteric bacteriophages may 
be effective candidate indicators for monitoring the microbiological quality of 
meat, poultry, and perhaps other foods during processing. The bacteriophage 
concentration method developed provides a simple, rapid, and practical tool for 
the evaluation of fecal contamination levels in ground beef and processed 
chicken meat.

The lysis function of RNA bacteriophage Qbeta is mediated by the maturation (A2) 
protein.

Karnik S(1), Billeter M.

Author information:
(1)Institut für Molekularbiologie I, Universität Zürich, Switzerland.

Complete or partial cDNA sequences of the RNA bacteriophage Qbeta were cloned in 
plasmids under the control of the lambdaP(L) promoter to allow regulated 
expression in Escherichia coli harbouring the gene for the temperature-sensitive 
lambdaCI857 repressor. Induction of the complete Qbeta sequence leads to a 
100-fold increase in phage production, accompanied by cell lysis. Induction of 
the 5'-terminal sequence containing the intact maturation protein (A2) cistron 
also causes cell lysis. Alterations of the A2 cistron, leading to proteins 
either devoid of approximately 20% of the C-terminal region or of six internal 
amino acids, abolish the lysis function. Expression of other cistrons in 
addition to the A2 cistron does not enhance host lysis. Thus, in Qbeta, the A2 
protein, in addition to its functions as maturation protein, appears to trigger 
cell lysis. This contrasts with the situation in the distantly related group I 
RNA phages such as f2 and MS2 where a small lysis polypeptide is coded for by a 
region overlapping the end of the coat gene and the beginning of the replicase 
gene.

A possibility to use terminal transferase to obtain hybridized RNA-probes has 
been investigated. Optimal conditions of the reaction proceeding were elaborated 
on the model objects--RNA of the phage MS2: 200 mM of potassium cacodylate, pH 
7.2, 1 mM CoCl2, 1 mM DTT, under the considerable surplus of the enzyme. The 
elaborated method was used to determine the area of early genes of cyanophage 
LPP-3. With this purpose total RNA preparations were isolated from 
cyanobacterium Plectonema boryanum CALU 465. The above preparations were labeled 
by means of terminal transferase and [alpha-32P] ATP and used as the probes in 
hybridization with the DNA restriction fragments of LPP-3. Proceeding from the 
results of Southern-blots, a conclusion was made, that the KpnI-fragment of 
genome of cyanophage LPP3 10 kb in size includes the early genes. A possibility 
of practical use of the developed method is discussed.

Hybrids between different species or genera of the single-stranded RNA 
coliphages have not been found in nature. Here, it has been shown that viable 
hybrids between different phage species can easily be generated in the 
laboratory by in vivo recombination. cDNA of species I phage MS2 located on a 
plasmid and lacking part of its 5' untranslated leader (5' UTR) was complemented 
with another plasmid carrying the 5' half of the genome of fr, a species I 
phage, or of KU1, a species II representative with low sequence similarity. When 
the two plasmids were present in the same cell there was spontaneous production 
of hybrid phages. Interestingly, these hybrids did not arise by a double or 
single crossover that would replace the missing MS2 sequences with those of fr 
or KU1. Rather, hybrids arose by attaching the complete 5' UTR of fr or KU1 to 
the 5' terminus of the defective MS2 phage. Several elements of the 5' UTR then 
occurred twice, one from KU1 (or fr) and the other from MS2. These redundant 
elements are in most cases deleted upon evolution of the hybrids. As a result, 
the 5' UTR of KU1 (or fr) then replaced that of MS2. It was earlier shown that 
this 5' UTR could assume two alternating structures that facilitated transient 
translation of the proximal maturation gene. Apparently, this timer function of 
the 5' UTR was exchangeable and could function independently of the rest of the 
genome. When hybrids were competed against wild-type, they were quickly 
outgrown, probably explaining their absence from natural isolates.

Bacteriophage removal by soil passage in two field studies was re-analyzed with 
the goal to investigate differences between one- and two-dimensional modeling 
approaches, differences between one- and two-site kinetic sorption models, and 
the role of heterogeneities in the soil properties. The first study involved 
removal of bacteriophages MS2 and PRDI by dune recharge, while the second study 
represented removal of MS2 by deep well injection. In both studies, removal was 
higher during the first meters of soil passage than thereafter. The software 
packages HYDRUS-ID and HYDRUS-2D, which simulate water flow and solute transport 
in one- and two-dimensional variably saturated porous media, respectively, were 
used. The two codes were modified by incorporating reversible adsorption to two 
types of kinetic sites. Tracer concentrations were used first to calibrate flow 
and transport parameters of both models before analyzing transport of 
bacteriophages. The one-dimensional one-site model did not fully describe the 
tails of the measured breakthrough curves of MS2 and PRD1 from the dune recharge 
study. While the one-dimensional one-site model predicted a sudden decrease in 
virus concentrations immediately after the peaks, measured data displayed much 
smoother decline and tailing. The one-dimensional two-site model simulated the 
overall behavior of the breakthrough curves very well. The two-dimensional 
one-site model predicted a more gradual decrease in virus concentrations after 
the peaks than the one-dimensional one-site model, but not as good as the 
one-dimensional two-site model. The dimensionality of the problem hence can 
partly explain the smooth decrease in concentration after peak breakthrough. The 
two-dimensional two-site model provided the best results. Values for k(att2) and 
k(det2) could not be determined at the last two of four monitoring wells, thus 
suggesting that either a second type of kinetic sites is present in the first 
few meters of dune passage and not beyond the second monitoring well, or that 
effects of soil heterogeneity and dimensionality of the problem overshadowed 
this process. Variations between single collector efficiencies were relatively 
small, whereas collision efficiencies varied greatly. This implies that the 
nonlinear removal of MS2 and PRD1 is mainly caused by variations in interactions 
between grain and virus surfaces rather than by physical heterogeneity of the 
porous medium. Similarly, a two-site model performed better than the one-site 
model in describing MS2 concentrations for the deep well injection study. 
However, the concentration data were too sparse in this study to have much 
confidence in the fitted parameters.

The complete nucleotide sequence of ssRNA phage AP205 propagating in 
Acinetobacter species is reported. The RNA has three large ORFs, which code for 
the following homologues of the RNA coliphage proteins: the maturation, coat and 
replicase proteins. Their gene order is the same as that in coliphages. RNA 
coliphages or Leviviridae fall into two genera: the alloleviviruses, like 
Q(beta), which have a coat read-through protein, and the leviviruses, like MS2, 
which do not have this coat protein extension. AP205 has no read-through protein 
and may therefore be classified as a levivirus. A major digression from the 
known leviviruses is the apparent absence of a lysis gene in AP205 at the usual 
position, overlapping the coat and replicase proteins. Instead, two small ORFs 
are present at the 5' terminus, preceding the maturation gene. One of these 
might encode a lysis protein. The other is of unknown function. Other new 
features concern the 3'-terminal sequence. In all ssRNA coliphages, there are 
always three cytosine residues at the 3' end, but in AP205, there is only a 
single terminal cytosine. Distantly related viruses, like AP205 and the 
coliphages, do not have significant sequence identity; yet, important secondary 
structural features of the RNA are conserved. This is shown here for the 3' UTR 
and the replicase-operator hairpin. Interestingly, although AP205 has the 
genetic map of a levivirus, its 3' UTR has the length and RNA secondary 
structure of an allolevivirus. Sharing features with both MS2 and Q(beta) 
suggests that, in an evolutionary sense, AP205 should be placed between Q(beta) 
and MS2. A phylogenetic tree for the ssRNA phages is presented.

Improved method for recovery of bacteriophage from large volumes of water using 
negatively charged microporous filters.

Current virus-recovery procedures using negatively charged microporous filters 
provide an inexpensive, reliable method for the recovery and detection of 
enteroviruses from water and wastewater; however, adjustment of the test samples 
to pH 3.5 to promote enterovirus adsorption results in significant inactivation 
of bacteriophage and an inability to simultaneously recover them from large 
volumes of water using this procedure. Procedures specifically designed for the 
detection of bacteriophage are currently in use but generally are only effective 
for small volumes of water. Positively charged filters can be used to recover 
both enteroviruses and bacteriophage from large volumes of water at neutral pH; 
however, the filters are expensive. The addition of manganese chloride to test 
solutions at pH 3.5 prior to filtration through negatively charged Filterite 
filters allowed for sampling of larger volumes of water by reducing the 
inactivation of bacteriophage and increasing the recovery of PRD1, MS2, and 
naturally isolated bacteriophage by a factor of four or five when compared with 
recoveries from solutions without MnCl2. This method provides an inexpensive, 
reliable alternative to large-volume bacteriophage recovery procedures that use 
positively charged filters at neutral pH.

Investigating the structural basis of purine specificity in the structures of 
MS2 coat protein RNA translational operator hairpins.

We have determined the structures of complexes between the phage MS2 coat 
protein and variants of the replicase translational operator in order to explore 
the sequence specificity of the RNA-protein interaction. The 19-nt RNA hairpins 
studied have substitutions at two positions that have been shown to be important 
for specific binding. At one of these positions, -10, which is a bulged 
adenosine (A) in the stem of the wild-type operator hairpin, substitutions were 
made with guanosine (G), cytidine (C) and two non-native bases, 2-aminopurine 
(2AP) and inosine (I). At the other position, -7 in the hairpin loop, the native 
adenine was substituted with a cytidine. Of these, only the G-10, C-10 and C-7 
variants showed interpretable density for the RNA hairpin. In spite of large 
differences in binding affinities, the structures of the variant complexes are 
very similar to the wild-type operator complex. For G-10 substitutions in 
hairpin variants that can form bulges at alternative places in the stem, the 
binding affinity is low and a partly disordered conformation is seen in the 
electron density maps. The affinity is similar to that of wild-type when the 
base pairs adjacent to the bulged nucleotide are selected to avoid alternative 
conformations. Both purines bind in a very similar way in a pocket in the 
protein. In the C-10 variant, which has very low affinity, the cytidine is 
partly inserted in the protein pocket rather than intercalated in the RNA stem. 
Substitution of the wild-type adenosine at position -7 by pyrimidines gives 
strongly reduced affinities, but the structure of the C-7 complex shows that the 
base occupies the same position as the A-7 in the wild-type RNA. It is stacked 
in the RNA and makes no direct contact with the protein.

Field and laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate inactivation of 
viruses attached to mineral surfaces. In a natural gradient transport field 
experiment, bacteriophage PRD1, radiolabeled with 32P, was injected into a 
ferric oxyhydroxide-coated sand aquifer with bromide and linear alkylbenzene 
sulfonates. In a zone of the aquifer contaminated by secondary sewage 
infiltration, small fractions of infective and 32P-labeled PRD1 broke through 
with the bromide tracer,followed bythe slow release of 84% of the 32P activity 
and only 0.011% of the infective PRD1. In the laboratory experiments, the 
inactivation of PRD1, labeled with 35S (protein capsid), and MS2, dual 
radiolabeled with 35S (protein capsid) and 32P (nucleic acid), was monitored in 
the presence of groundwater and sediment from the contaminated zone of the field 
site. Release of infective viruses decreased at a much faster rate than release 
of the radiolabels, indicating that attached viruses were undergoing surface 
inactivation. Disparities between 32P and 35S release suggest that the 
inactivated viruses were released in a disintegrated state. Comparison of 
estimated solution and surface inactivation rates indicates solution 
inactivation is approximately 3 times as fast as surface inactivation. The 
actual rate of surface inactivation may be substantially underestimated owing to 
slow release of inactivated viruses.

Application of wastewater to soil may result in the contamination of groundwater 
and soil with pathogenic microorganisms and other biological and chemical 
agents. This study was performed to determine the antiviral microbial activity 
of soil saturated with secondary effluent. Low concentrations (0.05mg/ml) of 
protease pronase resulted in the inactivation of more than 90% of seeded Cox-A9 
virus, whereas Poliovirus type 1, Hepatitis A virus (HAV) and MS2 bacteriophages 
were found to be insensitive to the enzyme activity. Exposure of Cox A9 virus to 
P. aeruginosa extracellular enzymes resulted in 99% inactivation of the seeded 
virus. Hepatitis A virus was found to be as sensitive as the Cox A9 virus, 
whereas Poliovirus 1 and MS2 were found to be insensitive to P. aeruginosa 
extracellular enzymatic activity. Furthermore, the time required for 99% 
reduction (T99) of Cox A9 and MS-2 Bacteriophage, at 15 degrees C, in soil 
saturated with secondary effluent was found to be 7 and 21 days, respectively. 
Faster inactivation was observed for MS2 and Cox A9 in soil saturated with 
secondary effluent incubated at 30 degrees C, T99 of 2 and 0.3 days, 
respectively. Although the concentration of the total bacterial count in the 
soil samples increased from 10(3) cfu/g to 10(5) cfu/g after 20 days of 
incubation at 30 degrees C, the proteolytic activity was below the detection 
level. The results of this study indicate that the virucidal effect of microbial 
activity is virus type dependent. Furthermore microbial activity in the soil 
material can be enhanced by the application of secondary effluent at higher 
temperature. The results also showed that MS2 bacteriophage can be used to 
predict viral contamination of soil and groundwater.

The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of flow rate on 
transport and retention of bacteriophage tracers in a fractured shale saprolite, 
which is a highly weathered, fine-grained subsoil that retains much of the 
fabric of the parent bedrock. Synthetic ground water containing PRD-1, MS-2, and 
bromide was passed through a saturated column of undisturbed shale saprolite at 
rates ranging from 0.0075 to 0.96 m d '. First arrival of the bacteriophage 
tracers in effluent samples in each of the experiments occurred within 0.01 to 
0.04 pore volumes (PV) of the start of injection, indicating that bacteriophage 
were advectively transported mainly through fractures or macropores. 
Bacteriophage transport velocities, based on first arrival in the effluent, were 
very similar to fracture flow velocities calculated using the cubic law for flow 
in a fractured material. For MS-2, maximum concentration and mass of tracer 
recovered both increased steadily as flow rate increased. For PRD-1, these 
values initially increased, but were nearly constant at flow rates above 0.039 m 
d(-1), indicating that approximately 50% of the observed losses were independent 
of flow rate. Evaluation of the data indicates that physical straining and 
electrostatic or hydrophobic attachment to fracture or macropore walls were the 
dominant retention processes. Inactivation and gravitational settling playing 
secondary roles, except at the slowest flow rates. The study suggests that 
microbial contamination from sources such as septic fields and sewage ponds may 
pose a threat to the quality of ground water and surface water in areas with 
saprolitic subsoils.

Recognition of diverse RNAs by a single protein structural framework.

School of MedicineAlbuquerque, NM 87131, USA.

The coat proteins of different single-strand RNA phages utilize a common 
structural framework to recognize different RNA targets, making them suitable 
models for studies of RNA-protein recognition generally, especially for the 
class of proteins that bind RNA on a beta-sheet surface. Here we show that 
structurally distinct molecules are capable of satisfying the requirements for 
binding to Qbeta coat protein. Although the predicted secondary structures of 
the RNAs differ markedly, we contend that they are approximately equivalent 
structurally in their complexes with coat protein. Based on our prior 
observations that the RNA-binding specificities of Qbeta and MS2 coat proteins 
can be interconverted with as few as one amino acid substitution each, and 
taking into account details of the structures of complexes of MS2 coat protein 
with wild-type and aptamer RNAs, we propose a model for the Qbeta coat 
protein-RNA complex.

Two fragments (1.9 and 1.8 kb) including, respectively, "structural" genes (A, 
B, and lysis polypeptide) and "replicase" gene, were obtained by reverse 
transcription PCR on the template of bacteriophage MS2 genome RNA. The fragments 
contained a common sequence which allowed the assembly of the entire functional 
genome sDNA. 1.8 kb fragment was subjected to two independent modifications: 1) 
so that the replicase gene could be replaced by other sequences no more than 1.5 
kb in size and 2) it was inserted (on an artifician Tn-like structure) into E. 
coli chromosome. A system for replication of MS2-like corpuscles was thus 
created, containing a "shortened" genome and having extra genes. For extra 
genes, aminoglycoside-3'-phosphotransferase (kanamycin resistance) or a sequence 
of antiviral genetic program directed against hepatitis C virus were used.

Breakthrough curves, on a semi-log scale, from tests in porous media with 
block-input of viruses, bacteria, protozoa and colloidal particles often exhibit 
a typical skewness: a rather slowly rising limb and a smooth transition of a 
declining limb to a very long tail. One-site kinetic models fail to fit the 
rising and declining limbs together with the tail satisfactorily. Inclusion of 
an equilibrium adsorption site does not seem to improve simulation results. This 
was encountered in the simulation of breakthrough curves from a recent field 
study on the removal of bacteriophages MS2 and PRD1 by passage through dune 
sand. In the present study, results of laboratory experiments for the study of 
this issue are presented. Breakthrough curves of salt and bacteriophages MS2, 
PRDI, and phiX174 in 1 D column experiments have been measured. One- and 
two-site kinetic models have been applied to fit and predict breakthrough curves 
from column experiments. The two-site model fitted all breakthrough curves very 
satisfactorily, accounting for the skewness of the rising limb as well as for 
the smooth transition of the declining limb to the tail of the breakthrough 
curve. The one-site model does not follow the curvature of the breakthrough 
tail, leading to an overestimation of the inactivation rate coefficient for 
attached viruses. Interaction with kinetic site 1 is characterized by relatively 
fast attachment and slow detachment, whereas attachment to and detachment from 
kinetic site 2 is fast. Inactivation of viruses and interaction with kinetic 
site 2 provide only a minor contribution to removal. Virus removal is mainly 
determined by the attachment to site 1. Bacteriophage phiX174 attached more than 
MS2 and PRD1, which can be explained by the greater electrostatic repulsion that 
MS2 and PRD1 experience compared to the less negatively charged phiX174.

A vibrational Raman optical activity (ROA) study of a range of different 
structural types of virus exemplified by filamentous bacteriophage fd, tobacco 
mosaic virus, satellite tobacco mosaic virus, bacteriophage MS2 and cowpea 
mosaic virus has revealed that, on account of its sensitivity to chirality, ROA 
is an incisive probe of their aqueous solution structures at the molecular 
level. Protein ROA bands are especially prominent from which, as we have shown 
by comparison with the ROA spectra of proteins with known structures and by 
using a pattern recognition program, the folds of the major coat protein 
subunits may be deduced. Information about amino acid side-chain conformations, 
exemplified here by the determination of the sign and magnitude of the torsion 
angle chi(2,1) for tryptophan in fd, may also sometimes be obtained. By 
subtracting the ROA spectrum of the empty protein capsid (top component) of 
cowpea mosaic virus from those of the intact middle and bottom-upper components 
separated by means of a caesium chloride density gradient, the ROA spectrum of 
the viral RNA was obtained, which revealed that the RNA takes up an A-type 
single-stranded helical conformation and that the RNA conformations in the 
middle and bottom-upper components are very similar. This information is not 
available from the X-ray crystal structure of cowpea mosaic virus since no 
nucleic acid is visible.

Transmission electron micrographs of Escherichia coli cells induced by cloned 
lysis genes from RNA bacteriophages GA (group A-II) and SP (group B-IV) revealed 
various morphological aspects of intermediates of lysing cells. Cells induced by 
the SP lysis gene became stretched and also tapered in shape and fragmentation 
of parts of the cells had also occurred. Cells induced by the GA lysis gene 
showed many ballooning structures on the cell surfaces and others leaked 
material through the cell wall. Some balloon-like structures also appeared on 
the surfaces of cells induced by the cloned lysis gene of RNA phage SP and 
material also appeared to be leaking through the cell wall in the photographs. 
The lysing cells observed by transmission electron microscopy showed various 
morphological aspects of intermediates of the lysing process.

The formation of a range of precursor ion charge states from a single 
concentrated and purified charge state, followed by activation of each charge 
state, is introduced as a means to obtain more protein structural information 
than is available from dissociation of a single charge state alone. This 
approach is illustrated using off-resonance collisional activation of the [M + 
8H]8+ to [M + 6H]6+ precursor ions of the bacteriophage MS2 viral coat protein 
following concentration and purification of the [M + 8H]8+ charge state. This 
range of charge states was selected on the basis of an ion trap collisional 
activation study of the effects of precursor ion charge state on the 
dissociation of the [M + 12H]12+ to [M + 5H]5+ ions. Gas-phase ion/ion 
proton-transfer reactions and the ion parking technique were applied to purify 
and concentrate selected precursor ion charge states as well as to simplify the 
product ion spectra. The high-charge-state ions fragment preferentially at the 
N-terminal side of proline residues while the product ion spectra of the lowest 
charge states investigated are dominated by C-terminal aspartic acid cleavages. 
Maximum structural information is obtained by fragmentation of the 
intermediate-charge states.

A simple method for microorganism identification is proposed in this paper. In 
this method, no isolation or fractionation of microorganisms and no special 
search algorithm or database are needed. Experimentally, a sample of the 
unfractionated intact microorganism is subjected to brief on-slide proteolytic 
digestion and the digestion product ions detected in matrix-assisted laser 
desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) are selected for tandem mass 
spectrometry (MS/MS). Database searching using the MS/MS spectrum identifies the 
microorganism protein, and thereby, according to the source of the protein, the 
microorganism. The method was demonstrated to be feasible with 
enterobacteriophage MS2 as the model microorganism. The novel method is simple, 
rapid, and requires a small quantity of sample.

A series of DNA-linked RNases H, in which the 15-mer DNA is cross-linked to the 
Thermus thermophilus RNase HI (TRNH) variants at positions 135, 136, 137 and 
138, were constructed and analyzed for their abilities to cleave the 
complementary 15-mer RNA. Of these, that with the DNA adduct at position 135 
most efficiently cleaved the RNA substrate, indicating that position 135 is the 
most appropriate cross-linking site among those examined. To examine whether 
DNA-linked RNase H also site-specifically cleaves a highly structured natural 
RNA, DNA-linked TRNHs with a series of DNA adducts varying in size at position 
135 were constructed and analyzed for their abilities to cleave MS2 RNA. These 
DNA adducts were designed such that DNA-linked enzymes cleave MS2 RNA at a loop 
around residue 2790. Of the four DNA-linked TRNHs with the 8-, 12-, 16- and 
20-mer DNA adducts, only that with the 16-mer DNA adduct efficiently and 
site-specifically cleaved MS2 RNA. Primer extension revealed that this 
DNA-linked TRNH cleaved MS2 RNA within the target sequence.

RNA recognition site of PP7 coat protein.

Author information:
(1)Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, University of New Mexico 
School of Medicine, Albuquerque, NM 87131, USA.

The coat proteins of different single-strand RNA phages use a common protein 
tertiary structural framework to recognize different RNA hairpins and thus offer 
a natural model for understanding the molecular basis of RNA-binding 
specificity. Here we describe the RNA structural requirements for binding to the 
coat protein of bacteriophage PP7, an RNA phage of Pseudomonas. Its recognition 
specificity differs substantially from those of the coat proteins of its 
previously characterized relatives such as the coliphages MS2 and Qbeta. Using 
designed variants of the wild-type RNA, and selection of binding-competent 
sequences from random RNA sequence libraries (i.e. SELEX) we find that tight 
binding to PP7 coat protein is favored by the existence of an 8 bp hairpin with 
a bulged purine on its 5' side separated by 4 bp from a 6 nt loop having the 
sequence Pu-U-A-G/U-G-Pu. However, another structural class possessing only some 
of these features is capable of binding almost as tightly.

In a recent field study on dune recharge, bacteriophages MS2 and PRD1 were found 
to be removed 3 log10 over the first 2.4 m and only 5 log10 over the next 27 m. 
To understand the causes of this nonlinear removal, column experiments were 
carried out under conditions similar to the field: same recharge water, 
temperature (5 +/- 3 degrees C) and pore water velocity (1.5 m day(-1)). Soil 
samples were taken along a streamline between the recharge canal and the first 
monitoring well. Bacteriophage phiX174 was included for comparison. The high 
initial removal in the field was found not to be due to heterogeneity of phage 
suspensions but to soil heterogeneity. Phage removal rates correlated strongly 
positively with soil organic carbon content, and relatively strongly positively 
with silt content and the presence of ferric oxyhydroxides. Soil organic carbon 
content, silt content and the presence of ferric oxyhydroxides were found to 
decrease exponentially with travel distance. Removal rates of phiX174 were found 
to be 3-10 times higher than those of MS2 and PRD1 due to the lower 
electrostatic repulsion that the less negatively charged phiX174 experiences. It 
is suggested that the high initial removal in the field is due to the presence 
of favorable sites for attachment formed by ferric oxyhydroxides that decrease 
exponentially with travel distance. Similar removal rates may be found at both 
laboratory and field scale. However, due to local variations at field scale 
detailed knowledge on soil heterogeneity may be needed to enable a reliable 
prediction of removal.

Norwalk and Norwalk-like viruses (NLV) are major causes of food- and 
water-related disease in the United States. There is no host cell line in which 
the NLV can be tested for infectivity. Feline calicivirus (FCV) and NLV both 
belong to the family Caliciviridae. FCV can be assayed for infectivity in the 
Crandell Reese feline kidney cell line, so FCV serves as a surrogate for NLV. 
This study is the first report of UV inactivation of FCV and also of using the 
plaque technique, in contrast to the 50% tissue culture infectious dose end 
point technique, to determine the FCV infectivity titer. The infectivity titers 
(log10 plaque-forming units/mL) of UV-inactivated FCV, hepatitis A virus (HAV), 
poliovirus type 1 (PV1) and two small, round coliphages were plotted as a 
function of UV dose and analyzed by regression analysis and analysis of 
variance. These fitted straight-line curves represent exponential inactivation, 
so UV inactivation can be said to show "one-hit kinetics." The decimal 
inactivation doses of UV for FCV, HAV, PV1, MS2 and phiX174 were 47.85, 36.50, 
24.10, 23.04 and 15.48 mW s/cm2, respectively. FCV appears to be the most UV 
resistant among the tested viruses.

Little information regarding the effectiveness of UV radiation on the 
inactivation of caliciviruses and enteric adenoviruses is available. Analysis of 
human calicivirus resistance to disinfectants is hampered by the lack of animal 
or cell culture methods that can determine the viruses' infectivity. The 
inactivation kinetics of enteric adenovirus type 40 (AD40), coliphage MS-2, and 
feline calicivirus (FCV), closely related to the human caliciviruses based on 
nucleic acid organization and capsid architecture, were determined after 
exposure to low-pressure UV radiation in buffered demand-free (BDF) water at 
room temperature. In addition, UV disinfection experiments were also carried out 
in treated groundwater with FCV and AD40. AD40 was more resistant than either 
FCV or coliphage MS-2 in both BDF water and groundwater. The doses of UV 
required to achieve 99% inactivation of AD40, coliphage MS-2, and FCV in BDF 
water were 109, 55, and 16 mJ/cm(2), respectively. The doses of UV required to 
achieve 99% inactivation of AD40, coliphage MS-2, and FCV in groundwater were 
slightly lower than those in BDF water. FCV was inactivated by 99% by 13 
mJ/cm(2) in treated groundwater. A dose of 103 mJ/cm(2) was required for 99% 
inactivation of AD40 in treated groundwater. The results of this study indicate 
that if FCV is an adequate surrogate for human caliciviruses, then their 
inactivation by UV radiation is similar to those of other single-stranded RNA 
enteric viruses, such as poliovirus. In addition, AD40 appears to be more 
resistant to UV disinfection than previously reported.

The effect of storage and lag time on MS2 bacteriophage susceptibility to 
ultraviolet radiation.

CA, USA. djolis@puc.sf.ca.us

The susceptibility of MS2 bacteriophage suspensions to UV radiation was assessed 
using a collimated beam technique. Storage of MS2 bacteriophage cultures at 4 
degrees C resulted in a decrease in phage susceptibility to UV radiation over 
time. After 18 days, the level of MS2 bacteriophage inactivation achieved for 
the range of UV doses tested decreased by 0.7 to 1.1 logs, but remained constant 
after that point. Changes in the protein coat of the bacteriophage, a decrease 
in viability over time, and an increase in coagulation may have played a role in 
the observed susceptibility decrease. A 2-hour lag time between the preparation 
of the MS2 suspension and the irradiation test also resulted in a decrease in 
phage susceptibility.

Growth and reduction of microorganisms in sediments collected from a greywater 
treatment system.

Disease Control, Solna, Sweden. jakob.ottosson@smi.ki.se

AIMS: To study the effects of competitive microbiota, temperature and nutrient 
availability on Salmonella, Enterococcus, Campylobacter spores of sulphite 
reducing anaerobes and bacteriophages MS2 and phiX174 in sediments from a 
greywater treatment system.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Standard culture methods were used. Bacteria died off 
rapidly under normal conditions (20 degrees C, competitive microbiota) but 
remained stable or grew in the other conditions studied. When the sediments 
became nutrient depleted after 2 weeks, a log-linear die-off was observed for 
Salmonella, which was higher at 20 degrees C than at 4 degrees C. Bacteriophage 
decay was shown to be log-linear from day 0, with T90 values ranging from 9 
(phiX174, 20 degrees C) to 55 days (phiX174, 4 degrees C). The MS2 phage had a 
significantly higher decay rate in tyndallized sediments (T90 = 17 days) than in 
original sediments (T90 = 47 days) (P < 0.001), with temperature not shown to 
affect the decay rate. Spores of sulphite-reducing anaerobes were not 
significantly reduced during the study period (35 days). Campylobacter died-off 
rapidly or entered a viable but non-culturable state and subsequently results 
were not provided.
CONCLUSIONS: Competition was the most important factor to suppress pathogenic 
bacterial growth in an eutrophic environment. When nutrient depleted conditions 
prevailed, temperature was more important and log-linear decay of microorganisms 
could be observed.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These findings suggest that the normally 
occurring microbiota will suppress pathogenic bacterial growth in nutrient rich 
sediments. With lower nutrient status, temperature is the more important factor 
in reducing pathogens.

The efficacy levels of different physical and chemical washing treatments in the 
reduction of viral and bacterial pathogens from inoculated strawberries were 
evaluated. Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Montevideo, poliovirus 1, and 
the bacteriophages PRD1, phiX174, and MS2 were used as model and surrogate 
organisms. Chemicals readily available to producers and/or consumers were 
evaluated as antimicrobial additives for the production of washes. The gentle 
agitation of contaminated strawberries in water for 2 min led to reductions in 
microbial populations ranging from 41 to 79% and from 62 to 90% at water 
temperatures of 22 and 43 degrees C, respectively. Significant reductions (> 
98%) in numbers of bacteria and viruses were obtained with sodium hypochlorite 
(50 to 300 ppm of free chlorine), Oxine or Carnebon (200 ppm of product 
generating "stabilized chlorine dioxide"), Tsunami (100 ppm of peroxyacetic 
acid), and Alcide (100 or 200 ppm of acidified sodium chlorite) washes. Overall, 
200 ppm of acidified sodium chlorite produced the greatest reductions of 
microorganisms. Hydrogen peroxide (0.5%) was slightly less effective than free 
chlorine in a strawberry wash and caused slight fruit discoloration. 
Cetylpyridinium chloride (0.1%) was effective in the reduction of bacterial 
species, while trisodium phosphate (1%) was effective against viruses. The 
consumer-oriented produce wash Fit was very effective (> 99%) in reducing the 
numbers of bacteria but not in reducing the numbers of viruses. Another wash, 
Healthy Harvest, was significantly less effective than Fit in reducing bacterial 
pathogens but more effective for viruses. The performance of automatic 
dishwashing detergent was similar to that of Healthy Harvest and significantly 
better than that of liquid dishwashing detergent. Solutions containing table 
salt (2% NaCl) or vinegar (10%) reduced the numbers of bacteria by about 90%, 
whereas only the vinegar wash reduced the numbers of viruses significantly (ca. 
95%).

OBJECTIVE: To use our knowledge of the three-dimensional structure and 
self-assembly mechanism of RNA bacteriophage capsids to develop novel virus-like 
particles (VLPs) for drug delivery and epitope presentation.
METHODS: Site-directed mutagenesis of a recombinant MS2 coat protein expression 
construct has been used to generate translational fusions encompassing short 
epitope sequences. These chimeric proteins still self-assemble in vivo into T = 
3 shells with the foreign epitope in an accessible location. Covalent 
conjugation has also been used to generate RNA stem-loops attached to the toxin, 
ricin A chain, or to nucleotide-based drugs, that are still capable of 
stimulating self-assembly of the capsid in vitro. These packaged drugs can then 
be directed to specific cells in culture by further covalent decoration of the 
capsids with targeting molecules.
RESULTS: Chimeric VLPs are strongly immunogenic when carrying either B or T cell 
epitopes, the latter generating cytokine profiles consistent with memory 
responses. Immune responses to the underlying phage epitopes appear to be 
proportional to the area of the phage surface accessible. Phage shells 
effectively protect nucleic acid-based drugs and, for the toxin construct, make 
cell-specific delivery systems with LD50 values in culture sub-nanomolar.
CONCLUSION: VLP technology has potential for therapeutic and prophylactic 
intervention in disease.

and Escherichia coli in miniature soil columns.

Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs) are important agents of waterborne illness and have 
been linked to several groundwater-related outbreaks. The presence of human 
enteric viruses, in particular the presence of NLVs, is difficult to detect in 
the environment. Consequently, surrogate organisms are typically used as 
indicators of viruses from faecal contamination. Whether traditional bacterial 
indicators are reliable indicators for viral pathogens remains uncertain. Few 
studies have directly compared mobility and reduction of bacterial indicators 
(e.g. coliforms, Escherichia coli) and other surrogate indicators (coliphages) 
with pathogenic human viruses in soil systems. In this study the mobility and 
comparative reduction of the prototype NLV, Norwalk Virus (NV), was compared to 
poliovirus 1 (PV1), a bacterial indicator (E coli, EC) and a viral indicator 
(coliphage MS2) through miniature soil columns. Replicate, 10 cm deep, miniature 
columns were prepared using three soils representing a range of soil textures 
(sand, organic muck, and clay). Columns were initially conditioned, then 
incubated at 10-14 degrees C, dosed twice weekly for 8 weeks with one column 
pore volume of virus-seeded groundwater per dose, followed by 8 weeks of dosing 
with one column pore volume per dose of unseeded, simulated rainwater. Columns 
were allowed to drain after each dosing until an effluent volume equivalent to 
an applied dose was collected. Column effluents and doses were assayed for all 
viruses and EC. Rapid mobility with minimal reduction was observed for all 
organisms in the sand. Similar reductions were observed in organic muck for most 
organisms but NV showed a greater reduction. No organisms were shown to pass 
through the clay columns. Elution of viruses, in particular PV1, from the 
columns was gradual. After cessation of microbe dosing, E. coli was less 
detectable than viruses in column effluents and, therefore, unreliable as a 
virus indicator.

The elimination of wastewater microbes is often necessary when effluent 
receiving waters are reused for different purposes e.g. for irrigation or as a 
raw water source of drinking water. In the present study, rapid sand filtration 
(SF) combined with the use of polyaluminium chloride coagulation was used as a 
pre-treatment to improve the quality of wastewater effluent before further 
treatment with UV irradiation. Pilot-scale experiments were run in four 
treatment plants in Finland. Treatment performance was followed by measuring 
physical and microbial parameters. Rapid sand filtration reduced suspended 
solids, turbidity and colour of effluents by about 90%, 70-80% and 20-50% 
respectively. It also improved the UV transmittance of water by up to 20%. 
Microbes and phosphorus were reduced by 90-99% and to 0.05 mg/L respectively. UV 
irradiation further reduced the number of microbes up to 99.9%. The efficiency 
of UV doses in pilot UV reactors was confirmed with collimated-beam device 
determinations and with added FRNA phages. More than 99.9% reduction of MS2 was 
achieved with the dose of 140mWs/cm2 in pilot UV reactors. Rapid sand filtration 
and the subsequent UV irradiation reduced the number of all the tested microbes 
to a low level, often below the detection limit. Suspended solids and the water 
turbidity were reduced to 1-2 mg/L and approximately 1 NTU respectively.

water treatment efficiency.

The assessment of water treatment facilities for their efficiency using 
alternate indicators is of paramount importance. Current methods for assessing 
efficiency are limited by the specific characteristics of the microorganisms, 
such as their different sensitivities to disinfectants. A pilot study was 
carried out to compare different treatment scenarios for the future upgrade of 
the Sergio Cuevas Water Treatment plant (the largest in the Caribbean) in San 
Juan, Puerto Rico. The treatment units under investigation included a 
coagulation-flocculation-sedimentation unit, dual-media filters, 
micro-filtration units, intermediate ozone injection and contact columns as well 
as a biological filtration unit. The plant was challenged at different stages of 
treatment with Bacillus subtilis spores and MS2 coliphages in an attempt to test 
them as possible alternate indicators of treatment plant performance. These 
organisms were chosen because of their resistance to disinfection and 
desiccation, their low analysis costs and ease of detection. The removal of 
spores and coliphages by each treatment unit tested was calculated by seeding a 
known concentration (5-7 log10) of spores and coliphages and following the 
removal or disinfection rates. The seeded indicators were detected using 
traditional culture techniques. Ballasted clarification was shown to be highly 
efficient at removing 99.1% (approximately 3 log10) of the spores and 85.1% 
(approximately 0.86 log10) of MS2. Ozone treatment inactivated 80.37% 
(approximately 1.4 log10) spores and 99.95% (approximately 3.07 log10) 
coliphages. The coliphage inactivation rate obtained confirmed data obtained by 
previous studies indicating that MS2 was less resistant to ozonation than B 
subtilis spores. The membrane technology had the best efficiency in terms of 
physical removal of spores achieving over 99.9% (> 3 log10) removal. Coliphage 
removal mechanisms remain to be determined and will be a future focus of the 
study. Preliminary results indicate that aerobic spores and coliphages may be 
useful as indicators to determine the efficiency of different drinking water 
treatment technologies.

Chlorination of indicator bacteria and viruses in primary sewage effluent.

Tree JA(1), Adams MR, Lees DN.

DT4 8UB, United Kingdom.

Wastewater disinfection is used in many countries for reducing fecal coliform 
levels in effluents. Disinfection is therefore frequently used to improve 
recreational bathing waters which do not comply with microbiological standards. 
It is unknown whether human enteric viruses (which are responsible for 
waterborne disease) are simultaneously inactivated alongside fecal coliforms. 
This laboratory study focused on the chlorination of primary treated effluent 
with three doses (8, 16, and 30 mg/liter) of free chlorine as sodium 
hypochlorite. Seeding experiments showed that inactivation (>5 log(10) units) of 
Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis was rapid and complete but that there 
was poor inactivation (0.2 to 1.0 log(10) unit) of F(+)-specific RNA (FRNA) 
bacteriophage (MS2) (a potential virus indicator) at all three doses. However, 
seeded poliovirus was significantly more susceptible (2.8 log(10) units) to 
inactivation by chlorine than was the FRNA bacteriophage. To ensure that these 
results were not artifacts of the seeding process, comparisons were made between 
inactivation rates of laboratory-seeded organisms in sterilized sewage and 
inactivation rates of organisms occurring naturally in sewage. Multifactorial 
analysis of variance showed that there was no significant difference (P > 0.05) 
between the inactivation rates for seeded and naturally occurring FRNA 
bacteriophage. However, laboratory-grown poliovirus was inactivated much more 
rapidly than were naturally occurring, indigenous enteroviruses (P < 0.001). 
This may reflect differences in the way indigenous virus is presented to the 
disinfectant. Inactivation rates for indigenous enteroviruses were quite similar 
to those seen for FRNA bacteriophage at lower doses of chlorine. These results 
have significance for the effectiveness of chlorination as a sewage treatment 
process, particularly where virus contamination is of concern, and suggest that 
FRNA bacteriophage would be an appropriate indicator of such viral inactivation 
under field conditions.

Bacteriophages and Clostridium spores as indicator organisms for removal of 
pathogens by passage through saturated dune sand.

In a field study on the efficiency of dune recharge for drinking water 
production, bacteriophage MS2 was shown to be removed 8 log(10) by passage 
through the dune sand. The question of whether pathogenic viruses would be 
removed as much as MS2 was studied by comparing complete breakthrough curves of 
MS2 with those of the human viruses Coxsackievirus B4 (CB4) and Poliovirus 1 
(PV1) in laboratory columns. The columns were designed to closely simulate the 
field conditions: same sand, water, porewater velocity and temperature. 
Employing a two-site kinetic model to simulate breakthrough curves, 
attachment/detachment to two types of kinetic sites as well as inactivation of 
free and attached viruses were evaluated. It was found that attachment to only 
one of the sites is of significance for determining overall removal. At field 
scale, removal of the less negatively charged PV1 was extrapolated to be about 
30 times greater than that of MS2, but removal of CB4 would be only as much as 
that of MS2. Also, removal of spores of Clostridium perfringens D10, a potential 
surrogate for Cryptosporidium oocysts, was studied. The attachment rate 
coefficient of the spores was 7.5 times greater than that of MS2. However, this 
does not imply that the removal of the spores is 7.5 times greater than that of 
MS2. Due to negligible inactivation in combination with detachment of previously 
attached spores, the actual removal rate of the spores depends on the duration 
of contamination and eventually all spores will break through. Provided no 
irreversible attachment or physical straining occurs, this may also be the case 
for other persistent microorganisms, like oocysts of Cryptosporidium.

In order to identify the reverse transcriptase activity in sera and conditioned 
media from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of large granular 
lymphocyte leukemia patients product enhanced reverse transcriptase activity 
(PERT) assays were performed using bacteriophage MS2 RNA as a template. All 
samples obtained from conditioned media of virus-infected cell lines as well as 
PBMCs of lymphocytic leukemia patients and normal healthy individuals tested 
positive with this assay. Therefore the validity of the assay was questioned. 
Careful evaluation of the assay revealed that some of the essential reagents 
used, such as Taq DNA polymerase and RNase inhibitor contained indigenous 
amplifiable DNA. DNase I treatment of Taq DNA polymerase before PCR reduced the 
product significantly. Moreover, no false positive results were observed when 
encephalomyocarditis virus RNA was used instead of MS2 RNA as the template. 
These results suggest a need for caution when using bacteriophage MS2 RNA as the 
template in PERT assays to confirm the presence of retroviral infection or for 
identification of novel retroviruses.

Electric fields and currents have been shown to be capable of disinfecting 
drinking water and reducing the numbers of bacteria and yeast in food. However, 
little research has been conducted regarding the effectiveness of electric 
fields and currents in the inactivation of viruses. The objective of this study 
was to compare the ability of bacteria and bacteriophage to survive exposure to 
direct electric current in an electrochemical cell, where they would be subject 
to irreversible membrane permeabilization processes, direct oxidation of 
cellular/viral constituents by electric current, and disinfection by 
electrochemically generated oxidants. Suspensions of the bacteria Escherichia 
coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacteriophage MS2 and PRD1 at both high 
(approximately 1 x 10(6)CFU or PFU/mL) and low (approximately 1 x 10(3)CFU or 
PFU/mL) population densities were exposed to currents ranging from 25 to 350 mA 
in 5s pulses. Post-exposure plaque counts of the bacteriophage were 
proportionally higher than bacterial culturable counts at corresponding current 
exposures. E. coli and MS2 were then exposed to 5 mA for 20 min at both high and 
low population densities. The inactivation rate of E. coli was 2.1-4.3 times 
greater than that of MS2. Both bacteria and bacteriophage were more resistant to 
exposure to direct current at higher population densities. Also, amelioration of 
inactivation within the electrochemical cell by the reducing agent glutathione 
indicates the major mechanism of inactivation in the electrochemical cell is 
disinfection by electrochemically generated oxidants. The implications of these 
results are that technologies relying upon direct current to reduce the numbers 
of microbes in food and water may not be sufficient to reduce the numbers of 
potentially pathogenic viruses and ensure the safety of the treated food or 
water.

Escherichia coli cell lysis profiles induced by the cloned lysis gene from RNA 
bacteriophages MS2 were presented. Transmission electron micrographs showed that 
ballooning structures appeared on the cell surfaces and the others were leaking 
materials through the cell wall. Harsh rupture of the host cell was also 
observed. Scanning electron micrographs revealed many extruded structures from 
the cells. For the scanning electron microscopy, plastic sheets coated with calf 
dermis collagen and SEMPORE filters were successfully used to collect the 
samples and for various chemical treatments. The lysing cells by bacteriophage 
MS2 lysis gene observed in transmission and scanning electron micrographs showed 
various morphological aspects of the intermediates in the lysing process.

biotracers used to determine the effluent retention time, an important 
performance indicator, in a Free Water Surface Constructed Wetland.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Production of the biotracers, coliphage MS2, and the 
bacteriophage of Enterobacter cloacae and antibiotic resistant endospores of 
Bacillus globigii is described in detail. Their subsequent use in three separate 
tracer experiments - January, March and June (2000) - revealed the variability 
of retention time with respect to effluent flow. The biotracer MS2 showed the 
constructed wetland had a retention time of 8-9 h at a mean discharge of 0.9 l 
s-1, increasing to 10-12 h at a mean discharge 0.3 l s-1. A similar retention of 
9-10 h at a mean discharge of 0.3 l s-1 was calculated for the Ent. cloacae 
phage. In contrast, use of endospores revealed considerably longer retention 
times at these mean discharge rates; 12-24 h and 36-48 h, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Biotracers could provide a useful and environmentally friendly 
technique to monitor effluent retention in constructed wetlands. At this stage 
the phage tracers appear particularly promising due to ease of isolation and 
recovery.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Initial results are encouraging and have 
highlighted the potential of biotracers as alternatives to chemical tracers, 
even in microbially-rich waters.

In this article we studied, by nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation 
measurements, the disassembly of a virus particle-the MS2 bacteriophage. MS2 is 
one of the single-stranded RNA bacteriophages that infect Escherichia coli. At 
pH 4.5, the phage turns to a metastable state, as is indicated by an increase in 
the observed nuclear magnetic resonance signal intensity upon decreasing the pH 
from 7.0 to 4.5. Steady-state fluorescence and circular dichroism spectra at pH 
4.5 show that the difference in conformation and secondary structure is not 
pronounced if compared with the phage at pH 7.0. At pH 4.5, two-dimensional 
(15)N-(1)H heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC) spectrum shows 
approximately 40 crosspeaks, corresponding to the most mobile residues of MS2 
coat protein at pH 4.5. The (15)N linewidth is approximately 30 Hz, which is 
consistent with an intermediate with a rotational relaxation time of 100 ns. The 
average spin lattice relaxation time (T(1)) of the mobile residues was measured 
at different temperatures, clearly distinguishing between the dimer and the 
equilibrium intermediate. The results show, for the first time, the presence of 
intermediates in the process of dissociation of the MS2 bacteriophage.

Inactivation of the bacteriophages PHI X 174 (somatic coliphage), MS2 
(F-specific coliphage) and B40-8 (phage infecting Bacteroides fragilis) 
suspended in tap water was studied applying gamma and electron beam irradiation 
as well. PHI X 174 phage was found to be a suitable viral indicator for water 
disinfection by means of ionizing radiation. The nutrient broths introduced 
simultaneously with the bacteriophages into the water when it is spiked with the 
phages for the experiments did not significantly change the scavenging capacity 
of the water matrix. No dose rate effect was observed with MS2 and B40-8 phages 
but PHI X 174 phage showed a clear dose rate effect. It was found that in water 
MS2 phage is significantly more sensitive to ionizing radiation than Escherichia 
coli.

Virus retention and transport as influenced by different forms of soil organic 
matter.

19717-1303, USA.

Organic materials are widespread in natural soil and aquatic environments. Their 
effect on virus transport is very important in assessing the risk for 
contamination of ground water by viruses. This study aimed to determine how 
different forms (mineral-associated and dissolved) of natural organic matter 
influence the retention and transport of two bacteriophages (MS-2 and phiX174) 
in two porous media (a sand and a soil). We found that mineral-associated 
organic matter significantly promoted the transport of one virus (MS-2) but not 
the other (phiX174) in a phosphate-buffered saline solution. Similarly, MS-2 was 
retained less in sand columns with increasing concentrations of dissolved humic 
acid, while little effect was observed for phiX174 under the same conditions. 
The two viruses have different surface properties and thus exhibited different 
reactivity to the metal oxides present on sand particles and were affected 
differently by organic matter. Because the organic matter used in the study was 
negatively charged and hydrophilic, blocking of virus sorption sites and 
increasing of virus-medium electrostatic repulsion arising from modification of 
the sand and virus surface by organic matter are probably responsible for the 
facilitated transport. For dissolved humic acid, its competition for sorption 
sites with viruses was an additional mechanism involved. This study suggests 
that the effect of organic matter varied depending on the organic material 
properties and the type of viruses involved. As a general trend, the effect of 
organic matter was dominated by electrostatic rather than hydrophobic 
interactions.

Norwalk virus and other human caliciviruses (noroviruses) are major agents of 
gastroenteritis, and water is a major route of their transmission. In an effort 
to control Norwalk virus in drinking water, Norwalk virus reduction by 
bench-scale ozone disinfection was determined using quantitative reverse 
transcription (RT)-PCR for virus assays. Two other enteric viruses, poliovirus 1 
and coliphage MS2, were included for comparison, and their reductions were 
assayed by infectivity assays as well as by RT-PCR. Virus reductions by ozone 
were determined using a dose of 0.37 mg of ozone/liter at pH 7 and 5 degrees C 
for up to 5 min. Based on two RT-PCR assays, the reductions of Norwalk virus 
were >3 log(10) within a contact time of 10 s, and these were similar to the 
reductions of the other two viruses determined by the same assay methods. Also, 
the virus reductions detected by RT-PCR assays were similar to those detected by 
infectivity assays, indicating that the RT-PCR assay is a reliable surrogate 
assay for both culturable and nonculturable viruses disinfected with ozone. 
Overall, the results of this study indicate that Norwalk virus as well as other 
enteric viruses can be reduced rapidly and extensively by ozone disinfection and 
that RT-PCR is a useful surrogate assay for both culturable and nonculturable 
viruses disinfected with ozone.

The ability to chemically modify the surfaces of viruses and virus-like 
particles makes it possible to confer properties that make them potentially 
useful in biotechnology, nanotechnology and molecular electronics applications. 
RNA phages (e.g. MS2) have characteristics that make them suitable scaffolds to 
which a variety of substances could be chemically attached in definite geometric 
patterns. To provide for specific chemical modification of MS2's outer surface, 
cysteine residues were substituted for several amino acids present on the 
surface of the wild-type virus particle. Some substitutions resulted in coat 
protein folding or stability defects, but one allowed the production of an 
otherwise normal virus-like particle with an accessible sulfhydryl on its 
surface.

Influence of groundwater characteristics on the survival of enteric viruses.

Western Australia, Perth, Australia.

AIMS: This study was undertaken to further understand the processes affecting 
the persistence of enteric viruses in groundwater.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Varying temperature, oxygen and nutrient levels were tested 
in the presence and absence of groundwater micro-organisms to determine which of 
the factors tested had dominant influence on the decay of Escherichia coli, the 
bacteriophage MS2, poliovirus and coxsackievirus. The results indicated that the 
most influential factor affecting the decay of the viruses and E. coli was the 
presence of groundwater micro-organisms. The results also implied that 
temperature, the presence of oxygen and nutrient levels indirectly influence 
viruses and E. coli decay by influencing the activity of the groundwater 
micro-organisms.
CONCLUSIONS: E. coli and the viruses displayed maximum decay under aerobic 
conditions, at 28 degrees C without the addition of nutrients in the presence of 
groundwater micro-organisms.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results suggest that if the mode of 
action of the groundwater micro-organisms could be determined then the decay of 
viral pathogens in recharged waters may be more easily predicted.

The removal of the Microsporidia, Encephalitozoon intestinalis, feline 
calicivirus and coliphages MS-2, PRD-1, and Fr were evaluated during 
conventional drinking water treatment in a pilot plant. The treatment consisted 
of coagulation, sedimentation, and mixed media filtration. Fr coliphage was 
removed the most (3.21 log), followed by feline calicivirus (3.05 log), E. coli 
(2.67 log), E. intestinalis (2.47 log), MS-2 (2.51 log). and PRD-1 (1.85 log). 
With the exception of PRD-1 the greatest removal of the viruses occurred during 
the flocculation step of the water treatment process.

Removals of MS2 bacteriophage virus using different membrane materials under 
different operating pressures were investigated. The results obtained in this 
study suggested that a better log removal in terms of MS2 bacteriophage virus 
could be achieved using Polyamide RO membrane under the optimum operating 
pressure of 100 psi. It is further noted that variable MS2 influent 
concentration levels resulted in corresponding variable log removals of the 
bacteriophages by the Polyamide RO membrane. The presence of MS2 bacteriophage 
virus in the effluent could possibly be due to leakage of bacteriophages through 
the membranes structure. Investigations using SEM and AFM showed that there were 
gaps or pores present in the membrane structure which were sufficiently large 
for the MS2 viruses to pass through.

A novel procedure for the localization of viral RNAs in protoplasts and whole 
plants.

College Park, College Park, MD 20742, USA.

Analysis of virus spread using co-expressed reporter proteins has provided 
important details on cell-to-cell and long-distance movement of viruses in 
plants. However, most viruses cannot tolerate insertion of large non-viral 
segments or loss of any open-reading frames, procedures required to detect 
viruses non-evasively. A technique used to localize mRNAs intracellularly in 
yeast has been modified for detection of viral RNAs in whole plants. The 
technique makes use of the binding of the coat protein of MS2 bacteriophage 
(CPMS2) to a 19 base hairpin (hp). A fusion protein, consisting of the CPMS2, 
green fluorescent protein (GFP), and a nuclear localization signal (NLS), was 
nuclear-localized upon transient expression in protoplasts. However, addition of 
the hp to the 3' untranslated region of Turnip crinkle virus (TCV-hp) and 
co-transfection of the virus and fusion protein construct into protoplasts 
resulted in the re-location of GFP to the cytoplasm. Neither the insertion of 
the hp nor the interaction with the fusion protein impaired any viral functions. 
Transgenic plants expressing the GFP-NLS-CPMS2 fusion protein were generated, 
and GFP was detected in nuclei of young plant cells. Foci of GFP cytoplasmic 
fluorescence were detected in TCV-hp-inoculated leaves at 2 days 
post-inoculation. Later, GFP was detected in young leaves near the midvein and 
in the base (support) cells of trichomes in the vicinity of secondary and 
tertiary veins. In older leaves, cytoplasmic GFP could be visualized throughout 
many of the leaves. This technique should be amenable for detection of any virus 
with a transformable plant (or animal) host and may also prove useful for 
localizing properly engineered host RNAs.

Effects of pH and temperature on the survival of coliphages MS2 and Qbeta.

University of Singapore, 119260, Singapore.

The RNA F-specific coliphages, MS2 and Qbeta, have been used as virus indicators 
in water and wastewater studies. It is therefore useful to have a good 
understanding concerning the effects of environmental factors on their survival 
in order to choose an appropriate candidate for assessing microbial safety in 
relation to water quality management. The effects of pH and temperature on the 
survival of these two coliphages were investigated. MS2 survived better in 
acidic conditions than in an alkaline environment. In contrast, Qbeta had a 
better survival rate in alkaline conditions than in an acidic environment. The 
inactivation rates of both coliphages were lowest within the pH range 6-8 and 
the temperature range 5-35 degrees C. The inactivation rates of both coliphages 
increased when the pH was decreased to below 6 or increased to above 8. The 
inactivation rates of both coliphages increased with increasing temperature. 
Qbeta behaved peculiarly in extreme pH buffers, i.e. it was inactivated very 
rapidly initially when subjected to an extreme pH environment, although the 
inactivation rate subsequently decreased. In general, MS2 was a better indicator 
than Qbeta. However, within the pH range 6-9 and at temperatures not above 25 
degrees C, either MS2 or Qbeta could be used as a viral indicator.

Visualization by cryo-electron microscopy of genomic RNA that binds to the 
protein capsid inside bacteriophage MS2.

The icosahedrally symmetrized structure of bacteriophage MS2 as determined by 
cryo-electron microscopy (EM) reveals the presence of genomic RNA that attaches 
to coat-protein dimers. Earlier X-ray diffraction studies revealed similar 
interactions between the unique operator hairpin of the MS2 genomic RNA and the 
coat-protein dimer. This observation leads us to conclude that not only the 
operator, but also many other RNA sequences in the genome of MS2, are able to 
bind to the coat-protein dimer. A substantial number of potential 
coat-protein-dimer binding sites are present in the genome of MS2 that can 
account for the observed RNA densities in the EM map. Moreover, it appears that 
these stem-loop structures are able to bind in a similar fashion to the coat 
protein dimer as the wild-type operator hairpin. The EM map also shows 
additional density between the potential operator-binding sites, linking the RNA 
stem-loops together to form an icosahedral network around the 3 and 5-fold axes. 
This RNA network is bound to the inside of the MS2 capsid and probably 
influences both capsid stability and formation, supporting the idea that capsid 
formation and RNA packaging are intimately linked to each other.

The relationship between the survival of enteric viral pathogens and their 
indicators (coliform bacteria and coliphages) is not well understood. We 
compared the survival rates of feline calicivirus (FCV), Escherichia coli, and a 
male-specific RNA coliphage MS2 at 4, 25, and 37 degrees C for up to 28 days in 
dechlorinated water. The survival rates of E. coli and FCV, a surrogate of 
noroviruses (NV), had a high degree of correlation at 4 and 25 degrees C, while 
MS2 phage survived significantly longer (P < 0.05) at these two temperatures. At 
37 degrees C, the survival rates for all three organisms were highly correlated. 
Decimal reduction values indicating the number of days needed for 90% reduction 
in titer (D values) decreased for all three organisms as storage temperatures 
increased. FCV had the shortest D value among all three organisms at all 
temperatures investigated. These findings indicate that F-specific RNA phages 
may be useful indicators of NV in the environment.

The effect of critical pH on virus fate and transport in saturated porous

and Technology, Socorro, NM 87801, USA.

Several viral transport experiments were conducted in a model aquifer 1 m long, 
using bacteriophages MS2 and phiX174 at various pH (4.6 to 8.3) conditions, to 
increase our understanding of virus behavior in ground water. The results 
indicate the existence of a critical pH at which the virus behavior changes 
abruptly. This is supported by data from field and batch experiments. The 
critical pH is determined to be 0.5 unit below the highest isoelectric point of 
the virus and porous medium. When water pH is below the critical pH, the virus 
has an opposite charge to at least one component of the porous medium, and is 
almost completely and irreversibly removed from the water. This suggests that 
electrostatic attraction at a subcritical water pH condition is an important 
factor controlling virus attenuation in ground water. The concept of critical pH 
can assist in the design of geologic barriers for preventing viral contamination 
in ground water.

Growth of male-specific bacteriophage in Proteus mirabilis harboring F-genotes 
derived from Escherichia coli. J. Bacteriol. 89:1231-1236. 1965.-Male-specific 
bacteriophage MS2 was shown to infect and grow in Proteus mirabilis strains 
which harbor F-genotes derived from Escherichia coli K-12. The burst size was 
2,000 to 3,000, which is similar to that in E. coli K-12, whereas the latent 
period was 45 min, definitely longer than that in E. coli. In spite of the 
multiplication of MS2 in male P. mirabilis in broth, P. mirabilis strains failed 
to show plaque formation by MS2 on agar plates; this failure may be related to 
the low efficiency of phage adsorption. No host-controlled modification of MS2 
by P. mirabilis was detected.

Enteric virions and microbial biofilms--a secondary source of public health 
concern?

Through their many sorption sites, microbial biofilms can accumulate both 
organic and inorganic particulate and colloidal material from bulk water 
environments. An application of such first principles to the ecology of 
"biocolloidal" enteric virions would suggest that they too may be concentrated 
by biofilms in a similar way. Though previous studies have isolated human 
gastrointestinal (enteric) virions from microbial biofilms, the exact human 
health significance of this has been neither fully investigated nor completely 
understood. Through an assessment of the location, accumulation and persistence 
of model enteric virion (phiX174, MS2 and B40-8 bacteriophages as well as 20 nm 
fluorescent latex microspheres) within biofilms, the aim of the current study 
was to investigate whether the interaction of enteric virions with distribution 
pipe biofilms could provide a secondary source of public health concern to 
consumers. Model enteric virions were found to be incorporated into biofilms at 
concentrations representing 1% of those present in the adjacent bulk water 
environment. A sub-population (0.01%) of these persisted throughout an 
experimental period of 30 days, inferring their potential to accumulate over 
time. Furthermore, model enteric virions were partitioned into bacterial 
microcolonies, environments where biofilm bacteria can persist and re-grow, even 
in the presence of "acceptable" levels of disinfection. A risk model for enteric 
virion accumulation and release from distribution pipe biofilms suggested that 
associated risks may exceed USEPA benchmark values. These findings could have 
wide-reaching implications in water treatment and distribution strategies, and 
necessitate a re-appraisal of current water guideline values.

treatment of municipal wastewater.

The City of Montreal Wastewater Treatment Plant uses enhanced physicochemical 
processes (ferric and/or alum coagulation) for suspended solids and phosphorus 
removal. The objective of this study was to assess the ability of peracetic acid 
(PAA), UV, or ozone to inactivate the indicator organisms fecal coliforms, 
Enterococci, MS-2 coliphage, or Clostridium perfringens in the effluent from 
this plant. PAA doses to reach the target fecal coliform level of 9000 CFU/100mL 
exceeded 6 mg/L; similar results were obtained for enterococci, and no 
inactivation of Clostridium perfringens was observed. However a 1-log reduction 
of MS-2 occurred at PAA doses of 1.5 mg/L and higher. It was expected that this 
effluent would have a high ozone demand, and would require relatively high UV 
fluences, because of relatively high effluent COD, iron and suspended solids 
concentrations, and low UV transmittance. This was confirmed herein. For UV, the 
inactivation curve for fecal coliforms showed the typical two-stage shape, with 
the target of 1000 CFU/100 mL (to account for photoreactivation) occurring in 
the asymptote zone at fluences >20 mJ/cm(2). In contrast, inactivation curves 
for MS-2 and Clostridium perfringens were linear. Clostridium perfringens was 
the most resistant organism. For ozone, inactivation was already observed before 
any residuals could be measured. The transferred ozone doses to reach target 
fecal coliform levels ( approximately 2-log reduction) were 30-50 mg/L. MS-2 was 
less resistant, but Clostridium perfringens was more resistant than fecal 
coliforms. The different behaviour of the four indicator organisms studied, 
depending on the disinfectant, suggests that a single indicator organism might 
not be appropriate. The required dose of any of the disinfectants is unlikely to 
be economically viable, and upstream changes to the plant will be needed.

Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) has been used to extend the structural 
characterization of the MS2 phage by examining its physical characteristics in 
solution. Specifically, the contrast variation technique was employed to 
determine the molecular weight of the individual components of the MS2 virion 
(protein shell and genomic RNA) and the spatial relationship of the genomic RNA 
to its protein shell. A consequence of this work was to evaluate a novel 
particle counting instrument, the integrated virus detection system (IVDS) that, 
in combination with SANS, has the potential to provide rapid quantitative 
physical characterization of unidentified viruses and phage.

Effect of soil properties on saturated and unsaturated virus transport through 
columns.

19717, USA.

Viruses from contaminant sources can be transported through porous media to 
drinking water wells. The objective of this study was to investigate 
inactivation and sorption of viruses during saturated and unsaturated transport 
in different soils. Bacteriophages phiX174 and MS-2, and Br- tracer in a 
phosphate-buffered saline solution were introduced into saturated and 
unsaturated soil columns as a step function under constant flow rate and 
hydraulic conditions. Results showed that significantly greater virus removal 
occurred in the unsaturated columns than in the saturated columns in the two 
soils containing high metal oxides content. However, the increase in virus 
retention under unsaturated conditions was not significant in two other soils 
having high phosphorus and calcium contents and high pH, and in another soil 
with high organic matter content. The results imply that the extent of water 
content effect on inactivation and sorption of viruses can range from 
significant to minimal depending on the properties of the transport medium. We 
found that the presence of in situ metal oxides was a significant factor 
responsible for virus sorption and inactivation. Therefore, soils with high 
metal oxides content may have the potential to be used as hydrological barriers 
in preventing microbial contamination in the subsurface environments. We also 
found that the water content effect on virus removal and inactivation strongly 
depended on solid properties of the testing medium.

Sorption of MS2 bacteriophage to layered double hydroxides: effects of reaction 
time, pH, and competing anions.

(1)Department of Plant and Soil Sciences, University of Delaware, Newark, DE 
19717-1303, USA.

Batch sorption and column breakthrough studies were conducted to investigate the 
potential of layered double hydroxides (LDHs) to remove bacteriophage MS2 from 
contaminated waters. All four of the LDHs evaluated in this study had very high 
retention capacities for MS2. Sorption results showed that MS2 could be 
completely removed from 5.2 x 10(2) plaque-forming units (pfu)/mL solution by 
Mg-Al LDH 2 (i.e., 2:1 Mg to Al ratio LDH), with the highest sorption capacity 
observed in this study of 1.51 x 10(10) pfu/g. Attachment of MS2 to LDHs was a 
rapid process and reached quasi-equilibrium after a 1-h reaction time. Within 
the pH range studied (pH 4-9), Mg-Al LDH 2 showed high sorption potential for 
MS2 at all pH values but sorption decreased slightly with increasing solution 
pH. Background solution anions influenced virus sorption, with SO4(2-) and 
HPO4(2-) decreasing sorption significantly whereas the presence of NO3- had 
little effect on the attachment of MS2 to Mg-Al LDH 2. The addition of another 
virus (phiX174) only caused a slight decrease in the retention of MS2 by Mg-Al 
LDH 2, suggesting that there was insignificant competitive sorption between MS2 
and phiX174 on LDH surfaces. Results from column experiments indicate that there 
was no MS2 breakthrough from columns packed with Mg-Al LDH 2-coated sand, 
suggesting complete MS2 retention at the virus concentration tested. The high 
mass recovery by beef extract solution revealed that the removal of viruses by 
the LDH was due to sorption of MS2 to LDH surfaces, rather than inactivation.

Mutations in the hydrophobic core and in the protein-RNA interface affect the 
packing and stability of icosahedral viruses.

Centro Nacional de Ressonância Magnética Nuclear de Macromoléculas, Universidade 
Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

The information required for successful assembly of an icosahedral virus is 
encoded in the native conformation of the capsid protein and in its interaction 
with the nucleic acid. Here we investigated how the packing and stability of 
virus capsids are sensitive to single amino acid substitutions in the coat 
protein. Tryptophan fluorescence, bis-8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonate 
fluorescence, CD and light scattering were employed to measure urea- and 
pressure-induced effects on MS2 bacteriophage and temperature sensitive mutants. 
M88V and T45S particles were less stable than the wild-type forms and completely 
dissociated at 3.0 kbar of pressure. M88V and T45S mutants also had lower 
stability in the presence of urea. We propose that the lower stability of M88V 
particles is related to an increase in the cavity of the hydrophobic core. 
Bis-8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonate fluorescence increased for the 
pressure-dissociated mutants but not for the urea-denatured samples, indicating 
that the final products were different. To verify reassembly of the particles, 
gel filtration chromatography and infectivity assays were performed. The phage 
titer was reduced dramatically when particles were treated with a high 
concentration of urea. In contrast, the phage titer recovered after 
high-pressure treatment. Thus, after pressure-induced dissociation of the virus, 
information for correct reassembly was preserved. In contrast to M88V and T45S, 
the D11N mutant virus particle was more stable than the wild-type virus, in 
spite of it also possessing a temperature sensitive growth phenotype. Overall, 
our data show how point substitutions in the capsid protein, which affect either 
the packing or the interaction at the protein-RNA interface, result in changes 
in virus stability.

Soil treatment of wastewater has the potential to achieve high purification 
efficiency, yet the understanding and predictability of purification with 
respect to removal of viruses and other pathogens is limited. Research has been 
completed to quantify the removal of virus and bacteria through the use of 
microbial surrogates and conservative tracers during controlled experiments with 
three-dimensional pilot-scale soil treatment systems in the laboratory and 
during the testing of full-scale systems under field conditions. The surrogates 
and tracers employed included two viruses (MS-2 and PRD-1 bacteriophages), one 
bacterium (ice-nucleating active Pseudomonas), and one conservative tracer 
(bromide ion). Efforts have also been made to determine the relationship between 
viruses and fecal coliform bacteria in soil samples below the wastewater 
infiltrative surface, and the correlation between Escherichia coli 
concentrations measured in percolating soil solution as compared with those 
estimated from analyses of soil solids. The results suggest episodic 
breakthrough of virus and bacteria during soil treatment of wastewater and a 2 
to 3 log (99-99.9%) removal of virus and near complete removal of fecal coliform 
bacteria during unsaturated flow through 60 to 90 cm of sandy medium. Results 
also suggest that the fate of fecal coliform bacteria may be indicative of that 
of viruses in soil media near the infiltrative surface receiving wastewater 
effluent. Concentrations of fecal coliform in percolating soil solution may be 
conservatively estimated from analysis of extracted soil solids.

Interior surface modification of bacteriophage MS2.

94720-1460, USA.

An efficient strategy for the interior surface functionalization of MS2 viral 
capsids is reported, featuring a new hetero-Diels-Alder bioconjugation reaction. 
After virus isolation, the RNA genome was removed from the spherical particles 
by exposure to pH 11.8 conditions for a period of 4 h. Following this, 180 
tyrosine residues on the interior surface of each "empty" capsid shell were 
modified by using a site-selective diazonium-coupling reaction. To attach 
additional functionality, the azo conjugate was reduced with Na2S2O4 to afford 
an ortho-amino tyrosine derivative. Oxidation of this moiety with NaIO4 produced 
an o-iminoquinone on the protein surface, which was found to undergo an 
efficient hetero-Diels-Alder reaction with N-(4-aminophenyl)acrylamide. This 
four-step procedure can be carried out in under 4 h, reaches high levels of 
conversion, and yields the desired conjugates in >60% overall yield.

A second-generation solar disinfection (SODIS) system (pouch) was constructed 
from food-grade, commercially available packaging materials selected to fully 
transmit and amplify the antimicrobial properties of sunlight. Depending upon 
the season, water source, and challenge organism, culturable bacteria were 
reduced between 3.5 and 5.5 log cycles. The system was also capable of reducing 
the background presumptive coliform population in nonsterile river water below 
the level of detection. Similar experiments conducted with a model virus, the 
F-specific RNA bacteriophage MS2, indicated that the pouch was slightly less 
efficient, reducing viable plaques by 3.5 log units in comparison to a 5.0 log 
reduction of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli O18:H11 within the same time 
period. These results suggest that water of poor microbiological quality can be 
improved by using a freely available resource (sunlight) and a specifically 
designed plastic pouch constructed of food-grade packaging materials.

A synergistic effect between silver and UV radiation has been observed that can 
appreciably enhance the effectiveness of UV radiation for inactivation of 
viruses. At a fluence of ca. 40 mJ/cm(2), the synergistic effect between silver 
and UV was observed at silver concentrations as low as 10 microg/liter (P < 
0.0615). At the same fluence, an MS-2 inactivation of ca. 3.5 logs (99.97%) was 
achieved at a silver concentration of 0.1 mg/liter, a significant improvement (P 
< 0.0001) over the ca. 1.8-log (98.42%) inactivation of MS-2 at ca. 40 mJ/cm(2) 
in the absence of silver. Modified Chick-Watson kinetics were used to model the 
synergistic effect of silver and UV radiation. For an MS-2 inactivation of 4 
logs (99.99%), the coefficient of dilution (n) was determined to be 0.31, which 
suggests that changes in fluence have a greater influence on inactivation than 
does a proportionate change in silver concentration.

Viruses are one of four classes of biothreat agents, and bacteriophage MS2 has 
been used as a simulant for biothreat viruses, such as smallpox. A paramagnetic 
bead-based electrochemical immunoassay has been developed for detecting 
bacteriophage MS2. The immunoassay sandwich was made by attaching a biotinylated 
rabbit anti-MS2 IgG to a streptavidin-coated bead, capturing the virus, and then 
attaching a rabbit anti-MS2 IgG-beta-galactosidase conjugate to another site on 
the virus. beta-Galactosidase converts p-aminophenyl galactopyranoside (PAPG) to 
p-aminophenol (PAP). PAPG is electroinactive at the potential at which PAP is 
oxidized to p-quinone imine (PQI), so the current resulting from the oxidation 
of PAP to PQI is directly proportional to the concentration of antigen in the 
sample. The immunoassay was detected with rotating disk electrode (RDE) 
amperometry and an interdigitated array (IDA) electrode. With an applied 
potential of +290 mV vs Ag/AgCl and a rotation rate of 3000 rpm, the detection 
limit was 200 ng/mL MS2 or 3.2 x 10(10) viral particles/mL with RDE amperometry. 
A trench IDA electrode was incorporated into a poly(dimethyl siloxane) channel, 
within which beads were collected, incubated with PAPG, and PAP generation was 
detected. The two working electrodes were held at +290 and -300 mV vs Ag/AgCl, 
and electrochemical recycling of the PAP/PQI couple by the IDA electrode lowered 
the limit of detection to 90 ng/mL MS2, or 1.5 x 10(10) MS2 particles/mL.

Genome properties and the limits of adaptation in bacteriophages.

Eight bacteriophages were adapted for rapid growth under similar conditions to 
compare their evolved, endpoint fitnesses. Four pairs of related phages were 
used, including two RNA phages with small genomes (MS2 and Qbeta) two 
single-stranded DNA phages with small genomes (phiX174 and G4), two T-odd phages 
with medium-sized, double-stranded DNA genomes (T7 and T3), and two T-even 
phages with large, double-stranded DNA genomes (T6 and RB69). Fitness was 
measured as absolute growth rate per hour under the same conditions used for 
adaptation. T7 and T3 achieved the highest fitnesses, able to increase by 13 
billionfold and three-quarters billionfold per hour, respectively. In contrast, 
the RNA phages achieved low fitness maxima, with growth rates approximately 
400-fold and 4000-fold per hour. The highest fitness limits were not 
attributable to high mutation rates or small genome size, even though both 
traits are expected to enhance adaptation for fast growth. We suggest that major 
differences in fitness limits stem from different "global" constraints, 
determined by the organization and composition of the phage genome affecting 
whether and how it overcomes potentially rate-limiting host processes, such as 
transcription, translation, and replication. Adsorption rates were also measured 
on the evolved phages. No consistent pattern of adsorption rate and fitness was 
observed across the four different types of phages, but within each pair of 
related phages, higher adsorption was associated with higher fitness. Different 
adsorption rate limits within pairs may stem from "local" constraints-sequence 
differences leading to different local optima in the sequence space.

Dual role of boxB RNA motif in the mechanisms of termination/antitermination at 
the lambda tR1 terminator revealed in vivo.

France.

Rho-dependent transcription termination at the phage lambda tR1 terminator is 
governed primarily by the upstream rut element that encodes two RNA regions rutA 
and rutB. The two regions are separated by the boxB RNA motif, which is believed 
to be dispensable for Rho activity but serves as a binding site for lambda N 
protein in the antitermination process. By using a minimal in vivo termination 
system, we show that the intervening boxB RNA motif has a double function in the 
mechanisms of termination/antitermination at lambdatR1. As a folded hairpin 
structure, it acts as a clamp that holds rutA and rutB side by side for optimal 
interactions with Rho leading to efficient termination. Conversely, the binding 
of N protein to boxB induces antitermination at lambdatR1 by preventing access 
of Rho to the rut sequences. This dual role was clearly shown in vivo by 
studying the effects of multiple mutations within the boxB hairpin stem on 
transcription termination and by substituting the N/boxB couple with the 
unrelated coat protein of phage MS2 and its stem-loop RNA binding site.

The objective of the present study was the development of a diagnostic reverse 
transcription (RT)-PCR for the specific detection of enterovirus (EV) RNA in 
clinical specimens controlled by an internal control (IC) RNA. The IC RNA 
contains the same primer binding sites as EV RNA but has a different probe 
region. The IC RNA was packaged into an MS2 phage core particle (armored) and 
was added to the clinical sample to allow monitoring of both extraction 
efficiency and RT-PCR efficiency. Serial dilutions of the IC RNA were made, and 
the detection limit of the RT-PCR was tested in a background of EV RNA-negative 
cerebrospinal fluid. The sensitivity and specificity of the RT-PCR assay were 
tested by using all 64 known EV serotypes, several non-EV serotypes, and two 
Quality Control for Molecular Diagnostics (QCMD) Program EV proficiency panels 
from 2001 and 2002. In total, 322 clinical specimens were tested by RT-PCR, and 
to establish the clinical utility of the RT-PCR, a comparison of the results of 
viral culture and RT-PCR was done with 87 clinical specimens. The lower limit of 
sensitivity was reached at about 150 copies of IC RNA/ml. All 64 EV serotypes 
were positive, while all non-EV serotypes were negative. All culture-positive 
samples of the 2001 QCMD proficiency panel (according to the 50% tissue culture 
infective doses per milliliter) were positive by RT-PCR. Invalid results, i.e., 
negativity for both EV RNA and IC RNA, due to inhibition of RT-PCR were observed 
for 33.3% of the members of the 2002 QCMD proficiency panel and 3.1% of the 
clinical specimens. Inhibition of RT-PCR could be relieved by the addition of 
400 ng of bovine alpha-casein per microl to both the RT reaction mixture and the 
PCR mixture. With this optimized protocol, the results for all samples of the 
2002 QCMD proficiency panel and all clinical specimens except one fecal sample 
(0.3%) were valid. Evaluation of the clinical samples demonstrated that EV 
infection could be detected in 12 of 87 samples (13.8%) by RT-PCR, while viral 
culture was negative. Our data show that the RT-PCR with armored IC RNA offers a 
very reliable and rapid diagnostic tool for the detection of EV in clinical 
specimens and that the addition of bovine alpha-casein relieved inhibition of 
the RT-PCR for 99.7% of clinical specimens.

We conducted a series of experiments to compare the survival of Escherichia 
coli, feline calicivirus, and F-specific coliphage MS2 on lettuce and cabbage 
with and without disinfection. Inoculated produce was held at 4, 25, or 37 
degrees C for 21 days or was treated with different concentrations of sodium 
bicarbonate, chlorine bleach, peroxyacetic acid, or hydrogen peroxide. Survival 
was measured by the decimal reduction value (time to 90% reduction in titer) and 
the change in log titers of the test organisms. A stronger correlation of 
survival measures was observed between feline calicivirus and MS2 than between 
E. coli and either of the viral agents at 25 and 37 degrees C. The maximum time 
to detection limit for MS2 at all temperatures was 9 days, whereas feline 
calicivirus was detected for a maximum of 14 days at 4 degrees C. In contrast, 
E. coli was detectable for 21 days at 4 and 25 degrees C and for 14 days at 37 
degrees C. Significant increases in E. coli titer occurred within the first 5 
days, but virus titers decreased steadily throughout the experiments. E. coli 
was also highly susceptible to all disinfectants except 1% sodium bicarbonate 
and 50 ppm chlorine bleach, whereas the viruses were resistant to all four 
disinfectants.

Effective wastewater treatment is critical to public health and well-being. This 
is especially true in developing countries, where disinfection of wastewater is 
frequently inadequate. People who live in these areas may benefit from 
wastewater disinfection using ozone. This study evaluated the ability of a new 
electrochemical process of ozone generation, which produced ozone continuously 
at high pressure and concentration by the electrolysis of water, to disinfect 
tap water and secondarily treated wastewater. Inactivation of Klebsiella 
terrigena, Escherichia coli, MS2 bacteriophage and poliovirus 1 was evaluated 
first in reverse osmosis (RO) treated water. Inactivation of K. terrigena 
(6-log), E. coli (6-log), MS2 (6-log) and poliovirus 1 (>3-log) was observed 
after 1 min of ozonation in a 1 L batch reactor. Experiments were then performed 
to assess the microbiological impact of disinfection using ozone on secondarily 
treated municipal wastewater. The effect of ozonation on wastewater was 
determined for total and faecal coliforms, bacteriophages and heterotrophic 
plate count (HPC) bacteria. Electrochemical ozone generators provided an 
effective, rapid and low-cost method of wastewater disinfection. Based on the 
results of this research, electrochemically generated ozone would be well suited 
to remote, small-scale, disinfection operations and may provide a feasible means 
of wastewater disinfection in developing countries.

The decimal elimination capacity (DEC) of slow sand filters (SSF) for viruses, 
bacteria and oocysts of Cryptosporidium has been assessed from full-scale data 
and pilot plant and laboratory experiments. DEC for viruses calculated from 
experimental data with MS2-bacteriophages in the pilot plant filters was 1.5-2 
log10. E. coli and thermotolerant coliforms (Coli44) were removed at full-scale 
and in the pilot plant with 2-3 log10. At full-scale, Campylobacter bacteria 
removal was 1 log10 more than removal of Coli44, which indicated that Coli44 was 
a conservative surrogate for these pathogenic bacteria. Laboratory experiments 
with sand columns showed 2-3 and >5-6 log10 removal of spiked spores of 
sulphite-reducing clostridia (SSRC; C. perfringens) and oocysts of 
Cryptosporidium respectively. Consequently, SSRC was not a good surrogate to 
quantify oocyst removal by SSF. Removal of indigenous SSRC by full-scale filters 
was less efficient than observed in the laboratory columns, probably due to 
continuous loading of these filter beds with spores, accumulation and retarded 
transport. It remains to be investigated if this also applies to oocyst removal 
by SSF. The results additionally showed that the schmutzdecke and accumulation 
of (in)organic charged compounds in the sand increased the elimination of 
microorganisms. Removal of the schmutzdecke reduced DEC for bacteria by +/-2 
log10, but did not affect removal of phages. This clearly indicated that, 
besides biological activity, both straining and adsorption were important 
removal mechanisms in the filter bed for microorganisms larger than viruses.

Artificial recharge of groundwater offers a semi-natural means to produce raw 
water for drinking-water plants. Surface water works are increasingly being 
replaced by artificial groundwater works in Finland. Two municipalities, one 
serving 30,000 and the other 170,000 inhabitants, have considered filtering 
river water through eskers for the production of potable water. In this study 
the removal of bacteriophages during infiltration of river water was estimated, 
for the evaluation of treatment adequacy in a field study. A 5-m-deep column of 
sand was constructed and used to mimic the percolating phase in infiltration. An 
artificial esker was constructed on the riverbank by isolating a 2-m-wide, 
2-m-deep and 18-m-long bed of coarse sand with plastic. The sand bed represented 
the saturated zone. River water was pumped at a rate of 40 L/h to the sand 
column. The river water was spiked with F+ specific RNA phage MS2 by adding 
phage suspension during one week at an average concentration of 4.3 x 10(9) 
PFU/mL. Samples for phage assays were taken during one month, from four sampling 
sites, on the basis of detention time as estimated by a tracer experiment with 
sodium chloride. The median count of MS2 for percolated water was 2.4 x 10(5) 
PFU/mL, representing a 96.7% reduction. During the passage of 6 m in the 
saturated zone, a further reduction of 98.5% occurred. During the passage from 6 
m to 12 m the additional reduction was 99.97%. The overall reduction was between 
6 and 7 log10 units. The removal of MS2 phages was rather efficient, although 
the esker material was coarse, mainly sandy, gravel.

Microbicidal efficacy of an advanced oxidation process using ozone/hydrogen 
peroxide in water treatment.

The combined application of ozone and hydrogen peroxide represents a kind of 
advanced oxidation for water treatment. The radicals that are generated during 
the process are used for the degradation of organic pollutants from groundwater 
and industrial effluents. The aim of our study was to evaluate the possible 
microbicidal, and particularly virucidal, efficacy of such a process, since no 
substantial data were available. The investigations were performed at a pilot 
plant installed for the elimination of perchloroethylene from polluted 
groundwater (reduction efficacy for perchloroethylene from 26 microg/L to 5 
microg/L). To enable a reliable evaluation of the microbicidal effect, a set of 
alternate test organisms was used. As model viruses we chose bacteriophages MS2 
(F+ specific, single-stranded RNA), phiX174 (single-stranded DNA) and PRD-1 
(coated, double-stranded DNA). Furthermore, spores of Bacillus subtilis were 
included as possible surrogates for protozoa and Escherichia coli as 
representative for traditional indicator bacteria used in water analysis. The 
microbicidal efficiency was compared to the inactivation by means of ozone under 
two standard conditions (20 degrees C): (a) 0.4 mg/L residual after 4 min and 
(b) 0.1 mg/L residual after 10 min. Surprisingly, a good microbicidal effect of 
the ozone/hydrogen peroxide process was found. This was somewhat unexpected, 
because we had assumed that the disinfection potential of ozone would have been 
interfered with by the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Escherichia coli and the 
three test viruses revealed a reduction of about 6-log. In contrast, spores of 
Bacillus subtilis showed after the total process a reduction of 0.4-log. These 
results matched the effect of the ozone treatment (a) with a residual of 0.4 
mg/L after 4 min contact time (20 degrees C). The test condition (b) with a 
residual of 0.1 mg/L ozone after a contact time of 10 min at 20 degrees C gave a 
higher reduction of the B. subtilis spores (1.5-log). The presented study 
revealed a satisfying microbicidal efficacy of the ozone/hydrogen peroxide 
process with respect to vegetative bacteria and viruses (bacteriophages). 
However, it has to be emphasised that intense mixing and sufficient contact time 
have to be optimised and tested for each individual installation.

Two different irrigation systems, subsurface drip irrigation and furrow 
irrigation, are tested to investigate the level of viral contamination and 
survival when tertiary effluent is used in arid and semi-arid regions. The 
effluent was injected with bacteriophages of PRD1 and MS2. A greater number of 
PRD1 and MS2 were recovered from the lettuce in the subsurface drip-irrigated 
plots as compared to those in the furrow-irrigated plots. Shallow drip tape 
installation and preferential water paths through cracks on the soil surface 
appeared to be the main causes of high viral contamination in subsurface drip 
irrigation plots, which led to the direct contact of the lettuce stems with the 
irrigation water which penetrated the soil surface. The water use efficiency of 
the subsurface drip irrigation system was higher than that of the furrow 
irrigation system. Thus, subsurface drip irrigation is an efficient irrigation 
method for vegetable crops in arid and semi-arid regions if viral contamination 
can be reduced. Deeper installation of drip tapes, frequent irrigations, and 
timely harvests based on cumulative heat units may further reduce health risks 
by ensuring viral die-off under various field conditions.

Water reuse for landscape irrigation requires the production of high quality 
virus-free effluents to minimize risk for human health. In order to establish 
the relevance of MS2 phages as an appropriate biodosimeter for UV design, a 
pilot plant study has been carried out with different types of wastewater 
effluents. The two pilot systems tested (low-pressure high output and 
medium-pressure UV units) were able to achieve 4 and 5 log MS2 reduction in 
tertiary filtered effluent at high calculated UV doses of 170 _ 10 and 300 
mJ/cm2, respectively. UV disinfection was extremely efficient for MS2 
inactivation in high quality effluents after reverse osmosis: detention times as 
low as one second and UV dose of 40 mJ/cm2 were sufficient to reach 5 log 
inactivation of MS2. UV irradiation also produced rapid inactivation of human 
pathogens such as poliovirus type 1 and indigenous enteroviruses at UV doses up 
to 3 times lower that those for MS2 disinfection. It was concluded that accurate 
UV unit design for a given type of wastewater could be ensured by pilot tests 
using laboratory-propagated MS2 as biodosimeter and collimated-beam tests as the 
calibration-check.

Noroviruses (previously Norwalk-like viruses) are the most common viral agents 
associated with food- and waterborne outbreaks of gastroenteritis. In the 
absence of culture methods for noroviruses, animal caliciviruses were used as 
model viruses to study inactivation by nonionizing (253.7-nm-wavelength [UV]) 
and ionizing (gamma) radiation. Here, we studied the respiratory feline 
calicivirus (FeCV) and the presumed enteric canine calicivirus (CaCV) and 
compared them with the well-studied bacteriophage MS2. When UV irradiation was 
used, a 3-log(10) reduction was observed at a fluence of 120 J/m(2) in the FeCV 
suspension and at a fluence of 200 J/m(2) for CaCV; for the more resistant phage 
MS2 there was a 3-log(10) reduction at a fluence of 650 J/m(2). Few or no 
differences were observed between levels of UV inactivation in high- and 
low-protein-content virus stocks. In contrast, ionizing radiation could readily 
inactivate MS2 in water, and there was a 3-log(10) reduction at a dose of 100 
Gy, although this did not occur when the phage was diluted in 
high-protein-content stocks of CaCV or FeCV. The low-protein-content stocks 
showed 3-log(10) reductions at a dose of 500 Gy for FeCV and at a dose of 300 
for CaCV. The inactivation rates for both caliciviruses with ionizing and 
nonionizing radiation were comparable but different from the inactivation rates 
for MS2. Although most FeCV and CaCV characteristics, such as overall particle 
and genome size and structure, are similar, the capsid sequences differ 
significantly, making it difficult to predict human norovirus inactivation. 
Adequate management of UV and gamma radiation processes for virus inactivation 
should limit public health risks.

The removal of bacteriophage MS2 and fluorescent-dyed polystyrene microspheres 
with intact and purposely compromised spiral-wound RO membrane elements was 
investigated. MS2 rejection with intact membrane elements was >99.9995%. A model 
developed for data evaluation revealed that the advective passage of MS2 through 
imperfections of intact membrane elements was <2 x 10(-5)% of the overall 
product water flow produced. The advective passage of MS2 and microspheres 
through a pinhole induced in one of the elements was 0.05-0.1% of the overall 
product water flow. Prolonged testing of both intact and compromised elements 
resulted in increased MS2 rejection corresponding to advective MS2 passage 
through membrane imperfections of <3 x 10(-7)% of the overall product water 
flow. The permeate flow rate obtained with an element with a larger pinhole was 
5-13% greater than that of the intact element, and the corresponding rejection 
of MS2 and microspheres was similar to that observed for sodium chloride. The 
use of a cracked o-ring in the connection of the permeate tube to the element 
vessel end-cup resulted in advective passage of MS2 through the crack of 
<0.0001% of the overall permeate flow.

The use of microbial tracers to monitor seasonal variations in effluent 
retention in a constructed wetland.

Queensgate, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, UK.

Effluent retention in a constructed wetland was determined using both microbial 
and chemical tracers. Seasonal variation in effluent retention was the main 
focus of the study. The biotracers used in the study were the coliphage MS2, a 
bacteriophage of Enterobacter cloacae and antibiotic resistant endospores of 
Bacillus globigii. Two separate tracer runs were conducted, Winter high flow 
(January 2002) and Summer low flow (June 2002). The three biotracers were 
evaluated simultaneously on both occasions, with the commonly used chemical 
tracer, rhodamine WT, a bright red fluorescent dye, being evaluated during the 
final experiment. The Winter tracer run was conducted during a typical Winter 
storm, with a mean effluent discharge of 4.1 ls(-1). Tracer recovery was 98% 
MS2, 91% Ent. cloacae phage and 2% endospore. Effluent retention was estimated 
at between 2 and 4 h at 90% phage tracer recovery. The Summer tracer run was 
conducted at a typical site operating discharge rate of 0.8 ls(-1). Tracer 
recovery was 23% MS2, 36% Ent. cloacae phage, 8% rhodamine and 14% for the 
endospores. Effluent retention was estimated at between 11 and 18 h at 90% of 
phage tracer recovery. Initial results are encouraging and indicate 
bacteriophage to have further potential as tracing agents in wetlands.

A comparison of the survival of F+RNA and F+DNA coliphages in lake water 
microcosms.

The survival of seven F+RNA phages (MS2 Group I ATCC type strain, two Group I 
environmental isolates, a Group II environmental isolate, a Group III 
environmental isolate, and two Group IV environmental isolates) and six F+DNA 
phages (M13, fd, f1, and ZJ/2 ATCC type strains, and two environmental isolates) 
were examined in microcosms using a surface drinking water source. Phages were 
spiked into replicate aliquots of a source water at about 20,000 pfu/ml. 
Replicate spikes were incubated at 4 and 20 degrees C and monitored for 110 
days. At 4 degrees C, Groups I and II F+ RNA phages were detectable through 110 
days, with reductions of about 1 and 3 log10, respectively. The Group III F+RNA 
phage demonstrated 5 log10 reduction after 3 weeks, and the Group IV F+RNA 
phages were reduced to detection limits (5 log10 reduction) within 10 days. Of 
the F+DNA phages, all four type strains were detectable with about 2.5 log10 
reduction after 110 days at 4 degrees C. The F+DNA environmental isolates were 
detectable with about a 4 log10 reduction after 110 days at 4 degrees C. All 
phages demonstrated faster decay at 20 degrees C. These results suggest that 
differences in F+ phage survival may influence their prevalence in environmental 
waters and the ability to attribute their prevalence to specific human and 
animal sources of faecal contamination.

Template-dependent incorporation of 8-N3AMP into RNA with bacteriophage T7 RNA 
polymerase.

UV-induced photochemical crosslinking is a powerful approach that can be used 
for the identification of specific interactions involving nucleic acid-protein 
and nucleic acid-nucleic acid complexes. 8-AzidoATP (8-N(3)ATP) is a 
photoaffinity-labeling agent which has been widely used to elucidate the ATP 
binding site of a variety of proteins. However, its true potential as a 
photoactivatable nucleotide analog could not be exploited due to the lack of 
8-azidoadenosine phosphoramidite, a monomer used in the synthesis of RNA, and 
the inability of 8-N(3)ATP to serve as an efficient substrate for bacteriophage 
RNA polymerase. In this study, we explored the ability of SP6, T3, and T7 RNA 
polymerases and metal ion cofactors to catalyze the incorporation of 8-N(3)AMP 
into RNA. Whereas transcription buffer containing 2.0-2.5 mM Mn(2+) supports T7 
RNA polymerase-mediated insertion of 8-N(3)AMP into RNA, a mixture of 2.5 mM 
Mn(2+) and 2.5 mM Mg(2+) further improves the yield of 8-N(3)AMP-containing 
transcript. In addition, both RNA transcription and reverse transcription 
proceed with high fidelity for the incorporation of 8-N(3)AMP and complementary 
residue, respectively. Finally, we show that a high-affinity MS2 coat protein 
binding sequence, in which adenosine residues were replaced by 8-azidoadenosine, 
crosslinks to the coat protein of the Escherichia coli phage MS2.

The maturation/lysis (A2) protein encoded by the group B single-stranded RNA 
bacteriophage Qbeta mediates lysis of host Escherichia coli cells. We found a 
frameshift mutation in the replicase (beta-subunit) gene of Qbeta cDNA causes 
cell lysis. The mutant has a single base deletion 73 nucleotides (nt) 3' from 
the start of the replicase gene with consequent translation termination at a 
stop codon 129-131 nt further 3'. The 43-amino acid C-terminal part of the 
67-amino acid product encoded by what in WT (wild-type) is the +1 frame, is rich 
in basic amino acids This 67-aa protein can mediate cell lysis whose 
characteristics indicate that the protein may cause lysis by a different 
mechanism and via a different target, than that caused by the A2 
maturation/lysis protein. Synthesis of a counterpart of the newly discovered 
lysis product in wild-type phage infection would require a hypothetical 
ribosomal frameshifting event. The lysis gene of group A RNA phages is also 
short, 75 codons in MS2, and partially overlaps the first part of their 
equivalently located replicase gene, raising significant evolutionary 
implications for the present finding.

In recent years, there has been increased interest in the use of male-specific 
or F+ coliphages as indicators of microbial inputs to source waters. Sero- or 
genotyping of these coliphages can also be used for microbial source tracking 
(MST). Among the male-specific coliphages, the F+ RNA (FRNA) viruses are well 
studied, while little is known about the F+ DNA (FDNA) viruses. We have 
developed a reverse line blot hybridization (RLB) assay which allows for the 
simultaneous detection and genotyping of both FRNA as well as FDNA coliphages. 
These assays included a novel generic duplex reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) 
assay for FRNA viruses as well as a generic PCR for FDNA viruses. The RT-PCR 
assays were validated by using 190 field and prototype strains. Subsequent DNA 
sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of RT-PCR products revealed the 
classification of six different FRNA clusters, including the well-established 
subgroups I through IV, and three different FDNA clusters, including one (CH) 
not previously described. Within the leviviruses, a potentially new subgroup 
(called JS) including strains having more than 40% nucleotide sequence diversity 
with the known levivirus subgroups (MS2 and GA) was identified. We designed 
subgroup-specific oligonucleotides that were able to genotype all nine (six 
FRNA, three FDNA) different clusters. Application of the method to a panel of 
351 enriched phage samples from animal feces and wastewater, including known 
prototype strains (MS2, GA, Q beta, M11, FI, and SP for FRNA and M13, f1, and fd 
for FDNA), resulted in successful genotyping of 348 (99%) of the samples. In 
summary, we developed a novel method for standardized genotyping of F+ 
coliphages as a useful tool for large-scale MST studies.

We have determined the structure to 2.8 A of an RNA aptamer (F5), containing 
2'-deoxy-2-aminopurine (2AP) at the -10 position, complexed with MS2 coat 
protein by soaking the RNA into precrystallised MS2 capsids. The -10 position of 
the RNA is an important determinant of binding affinity for coat protein. 
Adenine at this position in other RNA stem-loops makes three hydrogen bonds to 
protein functional groups. Substituting 2AP for the -10 adenine in the F5 
aptamer yields an RNA with the highest yet reported affinity for coat protein. 
The refined X-ray structure shows that the 2AP base makes an additional hydrogen 
bond to the protein compared to adenine that is presumably the principal origin 
of the increased affinity. There are also slight changes in phosphate backbone 
positions compared to unmodified F5 that probably also contribute to affinity. 
Such phosphate movements are common in structures of RNAs bound to the MS2 T = 3 
protein shell and highlight problems for de novo design of RNA binding ligands.

A series of antiviral compounds consisting of an intercalating acridine derived 
part, a spacer region and a reactive EDTA-derived conjugate was synthesized in 
an easy sequence starting from 1,omega-alkyldiamines. As shown in model

Effects of freezing and storage temperature on MS2 viability.

MN 55811, USA.

Monitoring human enteric virus levels in domestic wastewater effluent is crucial 
to protecting human health. Occasionally, during intensive sampling, wastewater 
samples must be stored for later viral analysis. Little data exist regarding how 
enteric viruses survive during storage at different temperatures in secondary 
treated wastewater. During a field-scale study assessing pathogen removal 
performance by various onsite treatment technologies, the MS2 bacteriophage, an 
indicator of enteric viruses, was inoculated into septic tank (STE), sand 
filter, peat filter and constructed wetland (CW) effluents to determine virus 
decay at various storage temperatures. Virus stored at temperatures > or =10 
degrees C and at -20 degrees C decayed nearly twice as fast as those stored at 4 
degrees C or -80 degrees C. Decreased water quality decreased viral decay rates 
at 4 degrees C and -80 degrees C, with slowest decay occurring in STE and the 
fastest in sterile PBS and low pH peat effluent. In CW effluent after 8 days, 
less MS2 was inactivated when stored at 4 degrees C (20%) compared to -80 
degrees C (58%); however, during extended storage (approximately 300 days), less 
MS2 was inactivated at -80 degrees C (75%) compared to 4 degrees C (93%). We 
recommend that viruses in wastewater be stored in the dark at 4 degrees C unless 
storage for >40 days is necessary.

[Plasmid spectra and phagotypes of Escherichia coli strains isolated from 
patients with large intestine tumours].

[Article in Russian]

Korneĭchuk EP, Danileĭchenko VV, Tovkach FN, Tymkiv MZ.

The work deals with connection between plasmid spectra and phagotypes of 
Escherichia coli strains isolated from patients with tumours in large intestine. 
It has been established that 70 % of this bacterium isolates from the normal 
tissue, intestine lumen and tumours are characterized by multiple content of 
plasmids. Sometimes large endogenic plasmids are accompanied by the closed ring 
DNA with discrete sizes: 3.2; 3.8 and 4.0 kb. Other extrachromosomal factors 
have the size of 63-119 kb and are divided into 5 discrete classes. Plasmid DNA 
which size is 69 and 119 kb occur rarely and are characteristic of only E. coli 
isolated from the tumour tissue. Cells of three isolates found in the tissues 
and intestine lumen contain a plasmid complex which consists of three different 
extrachromosomal DNA of 63, 82 and 102 kb. The complex availability correlates 
as a rule with multiple strain resistance to ampicillin, canamycin, and 
tetracycline. Variability of plasmids of clinical E. coli isolates is completed 
regularly by various phagotypes established by means of virulent bacteriophages 
T2, T4, T7, FE44, TuIb, Ox2 and MS2. In most cases one could trace interrelation 
between the plasmid spectrum and phagotype; the same phagotype includes the 
strains with the same set of plasmids. The work results create preconditions for 
the detailed study of the role of microbe factor in development and inhibition 
of tumours.

Disinfection of feline calicivirus (a surrogate for Norovirus) in wastewaters.

Tree JA(1), Adams MR, Lees DN.

Author information:
(1)Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science, The Nothe, 
Weymouth, Dorset, UK.

AIMS: To compare the inactivation of feline calicivirus (FCV) (a surrogate for 
Norovirus, NV) with the reduction of a bacterial water quality indicator 
(Escherichia coli), a human enteric virus (poliovirus) and a viral indicator 
(MS2, FRNA bacteriophage), following the disinfection of wastewaters.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Bench-scale disinfection experiments used wastewater 
(sterilized by gamma-irradiation) seeded with laboratory-cultured organisms. 
Seeded primary effluent was treated with different doses of applied free 
chlorine (8, 16 and 30 mg l(-1)). FCV and E. coli were easily inactivated by >4 
log10, within 5 min with a dose of 30 mg l(-1) of applied chlorine. Poliovirus 
was more resistant and a reduction of 2.85 log10 was seen after 30 min, MS2 was 
the most resistant organism (1 log10 inactivation). In further experiments 
seeded secondary effluent was treated with different doses of u.v. irradiation. 
To achieve a 4-log10 reduction of E. coli, FCV, poliovirus and MS2 doses of 
5.32, 19.04, 27.51 and 62.50 mW s cm(-2), respectively, were required.
CONCLUSIONS: Feline calicivirus and E. coli seeded in primary wastewater were 
very susceptible to chlorination compared with poliovirus and MS2. In contrast, 
FCV seeded in secondary wastewater was more resistant to u.v. irradiation than 
E. coli but more sensitive than poliovirus and MS2.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: FRNA phage was more resistant to 
inactivation than all the viruses tested. This suggests FRNA phage would be a 
useful and conservative indicator of virus inactivation following disinfection 
of wastewaters with chlorination or u.v. irradiation.

Association, Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire, UK. d.dawson@campden.co.uk

AIMS: To study the survival and removal of viruses from fresh fruit and 
vegetables using the bacteriophage MS2 as a potential surrogate for noroviruses.
METHOD AND RESULTS: Survival of MS2 in buffer and on fresh produce was studied 
at 4, 8 and 22 degrees C. At 4 and 8 degrees C a reduction of <1 log10 was 
observed after 50 days in buffer; however a reduction in excess of 1 log10 
occurred within 9 days at 22 degrees C. Similar results were obtained with fresh 
produce with virus survival times exceeding the shelf life of the produce. In 
washing experiments, using a chlorine wash (100 ppm), in all but one case <1.5 
log10 MS2 bacteriophage was removed from fruit and vegetables. The mean across 
all produce types was 0.89 log10. With potable water, reduction was lower (0.3 
log mean across all produce types).
CONCLUSIONS: MS2 survived for prolonged periods, both in buffer and on fresh 
produce, at temperatures relevant to chilled foods. It was not removed 
effectively by chlorine washing.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Bacteriophage MS2 has been evaluated as a 
potential surrogate for noroviruses on fresh produce. Experimental results 
together with current knowledge of norovirus resistance and survival indicate 
that MS2 could be used as an effective surrogate in future evaluations.

On the possible modulating role of the isoleucine AUA-codon in bacteriophage MS2 
RNA.

Jou WM(1), Van Montagu M, Fiers W.

Author information:
(1)Laboratory of Molecular Biology, University of Ghent, 9000 Ghent, Belgium.

A set of MS2 mutants were shown to have an additional silent mutation met --> 
ile at position 108 of the coat protein. As transitions are more frequent than 
transversions one would have expected an AUA codon in this position in the 
mutant RNAs. As the AUA codon is one of the best candidates for a modulation 
role in the control of translation in E. coli, the presence of this AUA in the 
gene for the protein made in major amounts upon viral infection would impose 
serious doubt on the theory of modulation. We have directly proven by 
minifinger-printing of mutant RNA and further analysis of the relevant spots 
that, in fact, the isoleucine residue at position 108 of the coat protein gene 
is specified by the non-rate-limiting AUU codon, in agreement with a modulation 
type of control of protein synthesis.

Different inactivation behaviors of MS-2 phage and Escherichia coli in TiO2 
photocatalytic disinfection.

University, Sillim-dong, Gwanak-gu, Seoul 151-742, South Korea.

Despite a wealth of experimental evidence concerning the efficacy of the 
biocidal action associated with the TiO(2) photocatalytic reaction, our 
understanding of the photochemical mechanism of this particular biocidal action 
remains largely unclear. It is generally accepted that the hydroxyl radical 
(.OH), which is generated on the surface of UV-illuminated TiO(2), plays the 
main role. However, our understanding of the exact mode of action of the 
hydroxyl radical in killing microorganisms is far from complete, and some 
studies report that other reactive oxygen species (ROS) (H(2)O(2) and O(2).(-), 
etc.) also play significant roles. In particular, whether hydroxyl radicals 
remain bound to the surface or diffuse into the solution bulk is under active 
debate. In order to examine the exact mode of action of ROS in inactivating the 
microorganism, we tested and compared the levels of photocatalytic inactivation 
of MS-2 phage and Escherichia coli as representative species of viruses and 
bacteria, respectively. To compare photocatalytic microbial inactivation with 
the photocatalytic chemical degradation reaction, para-chlorobenzoic acid, which 
rapidly reacts with a hydroxyl radical with a diffusion-limited rate, was used 
as a probe compound. Two different hydroxyl radical scavengers, tert-butanol and 
methanol, and an activator of the bulk phase hydroxyl radical generation, 
Fe(2+), were used to investigate their effects on the photocatalytic mode of 
action of the hydroxyl radical in inactivating the microorganism. The results 
show that the biocidal modes of action of ROS are very different depending on 
the specific microorganism involved, although the reason for this is not clear. 
It seems that MS-2 phage is inactivated mainly by the free hydroxyl radical in 
the solution bulk but that E. coli is inactivated by both the free and the 
surface-bound hydroxyl radicals. E. coli might also be inactivated by other ROS, 
such as O(2).(-) and H(2)O(2), according to the present results.

Comparison of bacteriophage and enteric virus removal in pilot scale activated 
sludge plants.

Author information:
(1)Laboratoire de biologie comparée des Protistes, Université Blaise Pascal, UMR 
CNRS 6023, Faculté de Pharmacie,Université d'Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand, France.

AIMS: The aim of this experimental study was to determine comparatively the 
removal of two types of bacteriophages, a somatic coliphage and an F-specific 
RNA phage and of three types of enteric viruses, hepatitis A virus (HAV), 
poliovirus and rotavirus during sewage treatment by activated sludge using 
laboratory pilot plants.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The cultivable simian rotavirus SA11, the HAV HM 175/18f 
cytopathic strain and poliovirus were quantified by cell culture. The 
bacteriophages were quantified by plaque formation on the host bacterium in agar 
medium. In each experiment, two pilots simulating full-scale activated sludge 
plants were inoculated with viruses at known concentrations, and mixed liquor 
and effluent samples were analysed regularly. In the mixed liquor, liquid and 
solid fractions were analysed separately. The viral behaviour in both the liquid 
and solid phases was similar between pilots of each experiment. Viral 
concentrations decreased rapidly following viral injection in the pilots. Ten 
minutes after the injections, viral concentrations in the liquid phase had 
decreased from 1.0 +/- 0.4 log to 2.2 +/- 0.3 log. Poliovirus and HAV were 
predominantly adsorbed on the solid matters of the mixed liquor while rotavirus 
was not detectable in the solid phase. In our model, the estimated mean log 
viral reductions after 3-day experiment were 9.2 +/- 0.4 for rotavirus, 6.6 +/- 
2.4 for poliovirus, 5.9 +/- 3.5 for HAV, 3.2 +/- 1.2 for MS2 and 2.3 +/- 0.5 for 
PhiX174.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study demonstrates that the pilots 
are useful models to assess the removal of infectious enteric viruses and 
bacteriophages by activated sludge treatment. Our results show the efficacy of 
the activated sludge treatment on the five viruses and suggest that coliphages 
could be an acceptable indicator of viral removal in this treatment system.

Comparison of bacteriophages for use in iodine inactivation: batch and 
continuous flow studies.

40506-0281, USA.

Inactivation rates in batch studies for four commonly used surrogate 
bacteriophages were measured in stable aqueous iodine solutions for the purpose 
of determining which was the most suited to evaluate iodine disinfection 
efficacy in batch and continuous flow conditions. Two types of group Leviviridae 
bacteriophages were used, Type I (MS2) and Type II (GA), along with group 
Microviridae, Phi-X174, and group Tectiviridae, PRD1. Inactivation was compared 
at iodine doses of 1.0-1.5 mg l2/l. MS2 was the most susceptible to iodine 
inactivation of the four phages tested. Inactivation of naked, icosahedral 
bacteriophages, MS2 and Phi-X174 demonstrated removals to below detection limits 
(>99.99%) in less than 10 min. Lipid-containing PRD1 and F+ssRNA GA 
bacteriophages demonstrated the greatest iodine resistance in batch experiments 
with an average of 1.82 logs of inactivation (98.5%) after 60 min and 1.05 logs 
of inactivation (91.1%) after 30 min respectively. Similarly, in continuous flow 
studies through pentaiodide quaternary ammonium strong base resin, MS2, GA and 
Phi-X174 were more strongly inactivated than PRD1. The lipid component of PRD1 
is thought to enhance resistance to iodine over non-lipid-containing 
bacteriophages by protecting easily oxidized groups on the protein capsid, but 
further research is needed before proving this hypothesis. The results from this 
research may provide a surrogate standard for more rigorous and developed 
research into the mode of iodine disinfection and its inactivation kinetics.

Madison, Madison, WI 53706, USA. bllau@cae.wisc.edu

Conventional filtration was designed to achieve high levels of particle and 
pathogen removal. Previous studies have examined the possibility of modifying 
filtration media to improve their ability to remove microorganisms and viruses. 
Although these studies have evaluated filter media coatings for this purpose, 
none have evaluated nanoscale particle suspensions as coating materials. The 
overall goal of this paper is to describe the preliminary test results of 
nanoporous aluminium oxide coated media that can be used to enhance filtration 
of nano and microparticles. Filtration tests were carried out using columns 
packed with uncoated and coated forms of granular anthracite or granular 
activated carbon. A positive correlation between isoelectric pH of filter media 
and particle removal was observed. The modified filter media with a higher 
isoelectric pH facilitated better removal of bacteriophage MS2 and 3 microm 
latex microspheres, possibly due to increased favorable electrostatic 
interactions.

Behaviors of the MS2 virus and related antibodies in capillary isoelectric 
focusing with whole-column imaging detection.

Liu Z(1), Pawliszyn J.

Author information:
(1)Department of Chemistry, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.

Capillary isoelectric focusing (CIEF) has potential importance for the study of 
viruses. CIEF with whole-column imaging detection (WCID) is a novel CIEF mode, 
providing the advantages of high resolution, high speed, and easy method 
development. To facilitate the application of CIEF-WCID to the immunoassay of 
viruses, a basic knowledge of related aspects is necessary. In this study, the 
MS2 bacteriophage was used as a virus model, and the behaviors of MS2 and 
related antibodies in CIEF were investigated with UV absorbance-WCID and 
laser-induced fluorescence (LIF)-WCID. The adsorption of the virus and 
antibodies on the capillary wall was found to be the critical issue in method 
development. Addition of salt was found to be an effective way to reduce the 
adsorption and to improve peak shape. The formation of an immunocomplex, which 
forms the basis of an immunoassay, was monitored with CIEF-WCID. In comparison 
with UV-WCID, LIF-WCID was advantageous due to its higher detection sensitivity 
and the elimination of precipitation. Utilization of the noncovalent fluorescent 
dye, NanoOrange, was demonstrated to be a potential approach for the fluorescent 
labeling of the virus model and antibody and the associated immunocomplex. The 
change in microheterogeneity during the immune interactions at different ratios 
was also observed.

Ability of cell biomass extracts of some medicinal plants to inhibit spontaneous 
segregation of new forms in E. coli MS2-induced unstable mutants system has been 
shown. The effect described is analyzed from the position of stabilizing 
activity of extracts concerning bacterial envelope membranes. The possible use 
of this bacterial system to study stabilizing effect as a separate stage of the

Poly(A) polymerase I (PAP I), the pcnB gene product, is the main enzyme 
responsible for RNA polyadenylation in Escherichia coli. Polyadenylated RNA 
molecules are rapidly degraded by a multiprotein complex called RNA degradosome. 
Here we demonstrate that apart from its presence in cytosol, PAP I is also 
localized in cellular membrane. Although this observation might appear 
surprising, it was demonstrated recently by others that E. coli RNA degradosome 
is also associated with the cytoplasmic membrane. Moreover, we show that 
development of single-stranded RNA bacteriophages MS2 and Qbeta, but not that of 
single-stranded DNA bacteriophage M13, is more efficient in the pcnB mutant 
relative to an otherwise isogenic pcnB(+) host.

BACKGROUND: Health care-associated infections most commonly result from 
person-to-person transmission via the hands of health care workers.
METHODS: We studied the efficacy of hand hygiene agents (n = 14) following 
10-second applications to reduce the level of challenge organisms (Serratia 
marcescens and MS2 bacteriophage) from the hands of healthy volunteers using the 
ASTM-E-1174-94 test method.
RESULTS: The highest log 10 reductions of S marcescens were achieved with agents 
containing chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG), triclosan, benzethonium chloride, and 
the controls, tap water alone and nonantimicrobial soap and water (episode 1 of 
hand hygiene, 1.60-2.01; episode 10, 1.60-3.63). Handwipes but not alcohol-based 
handrubs were significantly inferior from these agents after a single episode of 
hand hygiene, but both groups were significantly inferior after 10 episodes. 
After a single episode of hand hygiene, alcohol/silver iodide, CHG, triclosan, 
and benzethonium chloride were similar to the controls in reduction of MS2, but, 
in general, handwipes and alcohol-based handrubs showed significantly lower 
efficacy. After 10 episodes, only benzethonium chloride (1.33) performed as well 
as the controls (1.59-1.89) in the reduction of MS2.
CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial handwashing agents were the most efficacious in 
bacterial removal, whereas waterless agents showed variable efficacy. 
Alcohol-based handrubs compared with other products demonstrated better efficacy 
after a single episode of hand hygiene than after 10 episodes. Effective hand 
hygiene for high levels of viral contamination with a nonenveloped virus was 
best achieved by physical removal with a nonantimicrobial soap or tap water 
alone.

Filtration of Bacillus subtilis spores and the F-RNA phage MS2 (MS2) on a field 
scale in a coarse alluvial gravel aquifer was evaluated from the authors' 
previously published data. An advection-dispersion model that is coupled with 
first-order attachment kinetics was used in this study to interpret microbial 
concentration vs. time breakthrough curves (BTC) at sampling wells. Based on 
attachment rates (katt) that were determined by applying the model to the 
breakthrough data, filter factors (f) were calculated and compared with f values 
estimated from the slopes of log (cmax/co) vs. distance plots. These two 
independent approaches resulted in nearly identical filter factors, suggesting 
that both approaches are useful in determining reductions in microbial 
concentrations over transport distance. Applying the graphic approach to analyse 
spatial data, we have also estimated the f values for different aquifers using 
information provided by some other published field studies. The results show 
that values of f, in units of log (cmax/co) m(-1), are consistently in the order 
of 10(-2) for clean coarse gravel aquifers, 10(-3) for contaminated coarse 
gravel aquifers, and generally 10(-1) for sandy fine gravel aquifers and river 
and coastal sand aquifers. For each aquifer category, the f values for 
bacteriophages and bacteria are in the same order-of-magnitude. The f values 
estimated in this study indicate that for every one-log reduction in microbial 
concentration in groundwater, it requires a few tens of meters of travel in 
clean coarse gravel aquifers, but a few hundreds of meters in contaminated 
coarse gravel aquifers. In contrast, a one-log reduction generally only requires 
a few meters of travel in sandy fine gravel aquifers and sand aquifers. 
Considering the highest concentration in human effluent is in the order of 10(4) 
pfu/l for enteroviruses and 10(6) cfu/100 ml for faecal coliform bacteria, a 
7-log reduction in microbial concentration would comply with the drinking water 
standards for the downgradient wells under natural gradient conditions. Based on 
the results of this study, a 7-log reduction would require 125-280 m travel in 
clean coarse gravel aquifers, 1.7-3.9 km travel in contaminated coarse gravel 
aquifers, 33-61 m travel in clean sandy fine gravel aquifers, 33-129 m travel in 
contaminated sandy fine gravel aquifers, and 37-44 m travel in contaminated 
river and coastal sand aquifers. These recommended setback distances are for a 
worst-case scenario, assuming direct discharge of raw effluent into the 
saturated zone of an aquifer. Filtration theory was applied to calculate 
collision efficiency (alpha) from model-derived attachment rates (katt), and the 
results are compared with those reported in the literature. The calculated alpha 
values vary by two orders-of-magnitude, depending on whether collision 
efficiency is estimated from the effective particle size (d10) or the mean 
particle size (d50). Collision efficiency values for MS-2 are similar to those 
previously reported in the literature (e.g. ) [DeBorde, D.C., Woessner, W.W., 
Kiley, QT., Ball, P., 1999. Rapid transport of viruses in a floodplain aquifer. 
Water Res. 33 (10), 2229-2238]. However, the collision efficiency values 
calculated for Bacillus subtilis spores were unrealistic, suggesting that 
filtration theory is not appropriate for theoretically estimating filtration 
capacity for poorly sorted coarse gravel aquifer media. This is not surprising, 
as filtration theory was developed for uniform sand filters and does not 
consider particle size distribution. Thus, we do not recommend the use of 
filtration theory to estimate the filter factor or setback distances. Either of 
the methods applied in this work (BTC or concentration vs. distance analyses), 
which takes into account aquifer heterogeneities and site-specific conditions, 
appear to be most useful in determining filter factors and setback distances.

Sequence-selective interaction of the minor-groove interstrand cross-linking 
agent SJG-136 with naked and cellular DNA: footprinting and enzyme inhibition 
studies.

SJG-136 (3) is a novel pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer that is predicted from 
molecular models to bind in the minor groove of DNA and to form 
sequence-selective interstrand cross-links at 5'-Pu-GATC-Py-3' (Pu = purine; Py 
= pyrimidine) sites through covalent bonding between each PBD unit and guanines 
on opposing strands. Footprinting studies have confirmed that high-affinity 
adducts do form at 5'-G-GATC-C-3' sequences and that these can inhibit RNA 
polymerase in a sequence-selective manner. At higher concentrations of SJG-136, 
bands that migrate more slowly than one of the 5'-G-GATC-C-3' footprint sites 
show significantly reduced intensity, concomitant with the appearance of higher 
molecular weight material near the gel origin. This phenomenon is attributed to 
interstrand cross-linking at the 5'-G-GATC-C-3' site and is the first report of 
DNA footprinting being used to detect interstrand cross-linked adducts. The 
control dimer GD113 (4), of similar structure to SJG-136 but unable to 
cross-link DNA due to its C7/C7'-linkage rather than C8/C8'-linkage, neither 
produces footprints with the same DNA sequence nor blocks transcription at 
comparable concentrations. In addition to the two high-affinity 5'-G-GATC-C-3' 
footprints on the MS2 DNA sequence, other SJG-136 adducts of lower affinity are 
observed that can still block transcription but with lower efficiency. All these 
sites contain the 5'-GXXC-3' motif (where XX includes AG, TA, GC, CT, TT, GG, 
and TC) and represent less-favored cross-link sites. In time-course experiments, 
SJG-136 blocks transcription if incubated with a double-stranded DNA template 
before the transcription components are added; addition after transcription is 
initiated fails to elicit blockage. Single-strand ligation PCR studies on a 
sequence from the c-jun gene show that SJG-136 binds to 5'-GAAC-3'/5'-GTTC-3' 
(preferred) or 5'-GAGC-3'/5'-GCTC-3' sequences. Significantly, adducts are 
obtained at the same sequences following extraction of DNA from drug-treated 
K562 cells, confirming that the agent reaches the cellular genome and interacts 
with the DNA in a sequence-selective fashion. Finally, SJG-136 efficiently 
inhibits the action of restriction endonuclease BglII, which has a 
5'-A-GATC-T-3' motif at its cleavage site.

liquid class B biosolids.

This study investigated bioaerosol emission rates and plume characteristics of 
bioaerosols generated during land application of liquid Class B biosolids. In 
addition, it compared the rate of aerosolization of coliphages and total 
coliform bacteria during land application of liquid Class B biosolids to the 
rate of aerosolization during land application of groundwater inoculated with 
similar concentrations of Escherichia coli and coliphage MS2. Air samples were 
taken immediately downwind of a spray applicator as it applied liquid 
(approximately 8% solids) biosolids to farmland near Tucson, Arizona. Air 
samples were also collected immediately downwind of groundwater seeded with MS2 
and E. coli applied to land in an identical manner. Air samples, collected with 
liquid impingers, were taken in horizontal and vertical alignment with respect 
to the passing spray applicator. Vertical and horizontal sample arrays made it 
possible to calculate the flux of microorganisms through a virtual plane of air 
samplers, located 2 m downwind of the passing spray applicator. Neither 
coliphages nor coliform bacteria were detected in air downwind of spray 
application of liquid Class B biosolids. Based on limits of detection for the 
methodology, the rate of aerosolization during land application of liquid 
biosolids was calculated to be less than 33 plaque forming units (PFU) of 
coliphage and 10 colony forming units (CFU) of coliform bacteria per meter 
traveled by the spray applicator. The rate of aerosolization during land 
application of seeded groundwater was found to be, on average, 2.02 x 10(3) CFU 
E. coli and 3.86 x 10(3) PFU MS2 aerosolized per meter traveled by the spray 
applicator. This is greater aerosolization than was observed during land 
application of biosolids. Because concentrations of coliphages and coliforms 
were similar in the liquid biosolids and the seeded water, itwas concluded that 
some property of biosolids reduces aerosolization of microorganisms relative to 
groundwater. Additional experiments utilizing a novel air sampling protocol 
showed that the duration of bioaerosol exposure immediately (2 m) downwind of 
biosolids spray application is brief and the plume of bioaerosols generated is 
discrete. Additional air samples showed that aerosolization of coliphages and 
coliform bacteria after liquid biosolids have been applied to land does not 
occur at detectable levels.

Recently, DNA bacteriophages (M13, lambda) have been genetically engineered to 
transfer genes into mammalian cells. Although efficiencies observed are still 
relatively low, this opens the possibility of using these viruses as a new class 
of transfection agents not only for fundamental research purposes but also in 
gene therapy protocols or in other applications like vaccination. In this 
respect, it has been shown that a lambda bacteriophage engineered to express the 
hepatitis B surface antigen in mammalian cells could elicit an immune response 
against this antigen in mice and rabbits without any specific targeting of the 
bacteriophage. These impressive results would be even more encouraging if they 
could be obtained with an RNA bacteriophage, as RNA vaccines are preferred over 
DNA vaccines for safety reasons. Up to now, RNA bacteriophages have never been 
engineered for gene delivery. In this paper, we have sought to determine whether 
such a vector could be obtained by engineering the RNA bacteriophage MS2. We 
show that MS2 can be produced as virus-like particles (VLPs) in Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae and is able to package functional heterologous mRNAs, provided that 
these mRNAs contain the MS2 packaging sequence. For instance, linking the MS2 
packaging sequence to the human growth hormone (hGH) mRNA enabled the packaging 
of this particular mRNA in MS2 VLPs. Functionality in eukaryotic systems of 
packaged mRNAs was confirmed by showing that mRNAs purified from VLPs can be 
efficiently translated in vitro and in cell cultures. The high stability of MS2 
could, therefore, make MS2 VLPs a very powerful carrier for RNA vaccines.

The relative disinfection efficiencies of peracetic acid (PAA), hydrogen 
peroxide (H2O2) and sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) against Escherichia coli, 
Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enteritidis and coliphage MS2 virus were 
studied in laboratory-scale experiments. This study also evaluated the 
efficiency of combined PAA/ultraviolet irradiation (UV) and H2O2/UV treatments 
to determine if the microbial inactivation was synergistic. Microbial cultures 
were added into a synthetic wastewater-like test medium and treated by chemical 
disinfectants with a 10 min contact time, UV irradiation or the combination of 
chemical and UV treatments. A peracetic acid dose of 3 mg/l resulted in 
approximately 2-3 log enteric bacterial reductions, whereas 7-15 mg/l PAA was 
needed to achieve 1-1.5 log coliphage MS2 reductions. Doses of 3-150 mg/l 
hydrogen peroxide achieved below 0.2 log microbial reductions. Sodium 
hypochlorite treatments caused 0.3-1 log microbial reductions at an 18 mg/l 
chlorine dose, while 2.6 log reductions of E. faecalis were achieved at a 12 
mg/l chlorine dose. The results indicate that PAA could represent a good 
alternative to chlorine compounds in disinfection procedures, especially in 
wastewaters containing easily oxidizable organic matter. Hydrogen peroxide is 
not an efficient disinfectant against enteric microorganisms in wastewaters. The 
combined PAA/UV disinfection showed increased disinfection efficiency and 
synergistic benefits with all the enteric bacteria tested but lower synergies 
for the coliphage MS2. This suggests that this method could improve the 
efficiency and reliability of disinfection in wastewater treatment plants. The 
combined H2O2/UV disinfection only slightly influenced the microbial reductions 
compared to UV treatments and showed some antagonism and no synergies.

The performance of a duct-mounted air disinfection system, designed to reduce 
airborne pathogens in the hospital environment, was determined using a new 
testing methodology. The methodology places the equipment in a test duct, a 
microbial aerosol is generated and then sampled simultaneously before and after 
the test system. This allows a percentage efficiency value to be calculated. The 
air disinfection system is a novel chemical-coated filter and ultraviolet (UV) 
radiation air purification system, operating at a flow rate of 500 m(3)/h, 
against aerosols of MS2 phage and Mycobacterium vaccae (surrogates of viral and 
mycobactericidal pathogens). A three UV lamp system was effective against 
airborne phages, removing an average of 97.34% of the aerosolized challenge. 
With the UV component switched off, the average efficiency dropped to 61.46%. 
This demonstrates that the chemical-coated filter component plays a more 
significant role than the UV radiation in destroying phages. When six UV lamps 
were used, the system was able to remove mycobacteria with an efficiency 
exceeding 99.99%. This test methodology can be used to assess manufacturers' 
claims of efficacy of equipment against airborne micro-organisms in the hospital 
environment.

Comparison of electrocoagulation and chemical coagulation pretreatment for 
enhanced virus removal using microfiltration membranes.

4800 Calhoun Road, Houston, TX 77204-4003, USA.

This research studied virus removal by iron electrocoagulation (EC) followed by 
microfiltration (MF) in water treatment using the MS2 bacteriophage as a tracer 
virus. In the absence of EC, MF alone achieved less than a 0.5-log removal of 
MS2 virus, but, as the iron-coagulant dosage increased, the log virus removal 
increased dramatically. More than 4-log virus removal, as required by the 
Surface Water Treatment Rule, was achieved with 6-9 mg/L Fe(3+). The 
experimental data indicated that at lower iron dosages and pH (< approximately 8 
mgFe/L and pH 6.3 and 7.3) negatively charged MS2 viruses first adsorbed onto 
the positively charged iron hydroxide floc particles before being removed by MF. 
At higher iron dosages and pH (> approximately 9 mgFe/L and pH 8.3), virus 
removal was attributed predominantly to enmeshment and subsequent removal by MF. 
Additionally, the experimental data showed no obvious influence of ionic 
strength in the natural water range of 10(-7)-10(-2)M on MS2 virus removal by 
EC-MF. Finally, EC pretreatment significantly outperformed chemical coagulation 
pretreatment for virus removal. The proposed mechanism for this improved 
performance by EC is that locally higher iron and virus concentrations and 
locally lower pH near the anode improved MS2 enmeshment by iron flocs as well as 
adsorption of MS2 viruses onto the iron floc particles.

after flushing a domestic toilet.

AIMS: To determine the level of aerosol formation and fallout within a toilet 
cubicle after flushing a toilet contaminated with indicator organisms at levels 
required to mimic pathogen shedding during infectious diarrhoea.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A semisolid agar carrier containing either Serratia 
marcesens or MS2 bacteriophage was used to contaminate the sidewalls and bowl 
water of a domestic toilet to mimic the effects of soiling after an episode of 
acute diarrhoea. Viable counts were used to compare the numbers of Serratia 
adhering to the porcelain surfaces and those present in the bowl water before 
and after flushing the toilet. Air sampling and settle plates were used to 
determine the presence of bacteria or virus-laden aerosols within the toilet 
cubicle. After seeding there was a high level of contamination on the porcelain 
surfaces both under the rim and on the sides of the bowl. After a single flush 
there was a reduction of 2.0-3.0 log cycles cm(-2) for surface attached 
organisms. The number of micro-organisms in the bowl water was reduced by 
2.0-3.0 log cycles ml(-1) after the first flush and following a second flush, a 
further reduction of c. 2.0 log cycles ml(-1) was achieved. Micro-organisms in 
the air were at the highest level immediately after the first flush (mean 
values, 1370 CFU m(-3) for Serratia and 2420 PFU m(-3) for MS2 page). Sequential 
flushing resulted in further distribution of micro-organisms into the air 
although the numbers declined after each flush. Serratia adhering to the 
sidewalls, as well as free-floating organisms in the toilet water, were 
responsible for the formation of bacterial aerosols.
CONCLUSIONS: Although a single flush reduced the level of micro-organisms in the 
toilet bowl water when contaminated at concentrations reflecting pathogen 
shedding, large numbers of micro-organisms persisted on the toilet bowl surface 
and in the bowl water which were disseminated into the air by further flushes.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Many individuals may be unaware of the 
risk of air-borne dissemination of microbes when flushing the toilet and the 
consequent surface contamination that may spread infection within the household, 
via direct surface-to-hand-to mouth contact. Some enteric viruses could persist 
in the air after toilet flushing and infection may be acquired after inhalation 
and swallowing.

This study investigated whether colloid-sized particles can enmesh and protect 
viruses from 254-nm ultraviolet (UV) light and sought to determine the particle 
characteristics (e.g. size, chemical composition) that are most relevant in 
causing a protective effect. Two viral surrogates (MS2 coliphage and 
bacteriophage T4), three types of particles (kaolin clay, humic acid powder, and 
activated sludge), two coagulants (alum and ferric chloride), two filtration 
conditions (none and 0.45 microm), and two UV doses (40 and 80 mJ/cm2 for MS2 
coliphage; 2 and 7 mJ/cm2 for bacteriophage T4) were considered in a series of 
bench-scale UV collimated beam experiments. Transmission electron microscopy was 
used to qualitatively confirm the phage particle-association after coagulation. 
Humic acid and activated sludge floc particles shielded both viral surrogates to 
a statistically significant degree (with >99% confidence) relative to 
particle-free control conditions, while the kaolin clay particles provided no 
significant protection. The results of the study suggest that particles <2 
microm in diameter are large enough to protect viruses from UV light and that 
particulate chemical composition (e.g. UV-absorbing organic content) may be a 
critical factor in the survival of particle-associated viruses during UV 
disinfection.

The influence of ionic strength on the interaction of viruses with charged 
surfaces under environmental conditions.

94550, USA.

The influence of ionic strength on the electrostatic interaction of viruses with 
environmentally relevant surfaces was determined for three viruses, MS2, Q beta, 
and Norwalk. The virus is modeled as a particle comprised of ionizable amino 
acid residues in a shell surrounding a spherical RNA core of negative charge, 
these charges being compensated for by a Coulomb screening due to intercalated 
ions. A second model of the virus involving surface charges only is included for 
comparison. Surface potential calculations for each of the viruses show 
excellent agreement with electrophoretic mobility and zeta potential 
measurements as a function of pH. The environmental surface is modeled as a 
homogeneous plane held at constant potential with and without a finite region 
(patch) of opposite potential. The results indicate that the electrostatic 
interaction between the virus and the oppositely charged patch is significantly 
influenced by the conditions of ionic strength, pH and size of the patch. 
Specifically, at pH 7, the Norwalk virus interacts more strongly with the patch 
than MS2 (approximately 51 vs approximately 9kT) but at pH 5, the 
Norwalk-surface interaction is negligible while that of MS2 is approximately 
5.9kT. The resulting ramifications for the use of MS2 as a surrogate for Norwalk 
are discussed.

Simultaneous detection of two bacterial pathogens using bacteriophage

The simultaneous analysis of multiple target microorganisms using 
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry 
(MALDI-TOFMS) with bacteriophage amplification is discussed. Following infection 
of target bacteria with specific bacteriophages, proteins contained in the 
progeny phage are utilized as a secondary biomarker for the target bacterium. 
Escherichia coli when mixed with MS2 and MPSS-1 phages specific for E. coli and 
Salmonella spp., respectively, at levels below their corresponding detection 
limits, produced only the protein (13.7 kDa) characteristic of the MS2. 
Likewise, Salmonella spp. when mixed with the two phages only produced a protein 
(13.5 kDa) characteristic of MPSS-1. When the two bacteria and the two phages 
were mixed together, proteins characteristic of MS2 and MPSS-1 were observed 
indicating that both bacteriophages had been amplified. Identification of each 
bacterium was made based on the presence of the secondary bacteriophage 
biomarkers. No deleterious effects on bacteriophage amplification were observed 
because of the presence of multiple bacteria or bacteriophages.

Diagnostic systems based on reverse transcription (RT)-PCR are widely used for 
the detection of viral genomes in different human specimens. The application of 
internal controls (IC) to monitor each step of nucleic acid amplification is 
necessary to prevent false-negative results due to inhibition or human error. In 
this study, we designed various real-time RT-PCRs utilizing the coliphage MS2 
replicase gene, which differ in detection format, amplicon size, and efficiency 
of amplification. These noncompetitive IC assays, using TaqMan, hybridization 
probe, or duplex scorpion probe techniques, were tested on the LightCycler and 
Rotorgene systems. In our approach, clinical specimens were spiked with the 
control virus to monitor the efficiency of extraction, reverse transcription, 
and amplification steps. The MS2 RT-PCR assays were applied for internal control 
when using a second target hepatitis C virus RNA in duplex PCR in blood donor 
screening. The 95% detection limit was calculated by probit analysis to 44.9 
copies per PCR (range, 38.4 to 73.4). As demonstrated routinely, application of 
MS2 IC assays exhibits low variability and can be applied in various RT-PCR 
assays. MS2 phage lysates were obtained under standard laboratory conditions. 
The quantification of phage and template RNA was performed by plating assays to 
determine PFU or via real-time RT-PCR. High stability of the MS2 phage 
preparations stored at -20 degrees C, 4 degrees C, and room temperature was 
demonstrated.

A membrane bioreactor (MBR) may serve as a pre-disinfection or disinfection 
unit, in addition to its solid/liquid separation and biological conversion 
functions, to produce sewage effluent of high quality. This bench-scale pilot 
study focuses on investigating the performance of a submerged MBR in pathogen 
removal and the factors affecting the removal, using a 0.4-microm hollow-fiber 
membrane module submerged in an aeration tank and bacteriophage MS-2 as the 
indicator organism. Removal of the MS-2 phage was found to be contributed by 
physical filtration by the membrane itself, biomass activity in the aeration 
tank and bio-filtration achieved by the biofilm developed on the membrane 
surface. The membrane alone gave poor virus removal (0.4+/-0.1 log) but the 
overall removal increased substantially with the presence of biomass and the 
membrane-surface-attached biofilm. The contributions of the suspended biomass 
and attached biofilm to the phage removal are dependent on the inter-related 
parameters including the concentration of mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS), 
the sludge retention time (SRT) and the food to mass (F/M) ratio. The 
correlations between effluent flux/trans-membrane pressure and virus removal 
give evidence that phage removal in the MBR is most likely susceptible to both 
biological and physical factors including the quantity and property of the 
biomass and the biofilm and the membrane pore size reduction.

Rotavirus virus-like particles (VLPs) and MS2 bacteriophages were bioaccumulated 
in bivalve mollusks to evaluate viral persistence in shellfish during depuration 
and relaying under natural conditions. Using this nonpathogenic surrogate virus, 
we were able to demonstrate that about 1 log10 of VLPs was depurated after 1 
week in warm seawater (22 degrees C). Phage MS2 was depurated more rapidly 
(about 2 log10 in 1 week) than were VLPs, as determined using a 
single-compartment model and linear regression analysis. After being relayed in 
the estuary under the influence of the tides, VLPs were detected in oysters for 
up to 82 days following seeding with high levels of VLPs (concentration range 
between 10(10) and 10(9) particles per g of pancreatic tissue) and for 37 days 
for lower contamination levels (10(5) particles per g of pancreatic tissue). 
These data suggest that viral particles may persist in shellfish tissues for 
several weeks.

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed at the codon 15 of the MS2 bacteriophage 
coat protein gene,which had been cloned to the virus-like particles expression 
vector containing non-self RNA fragment. The produced expression vector,termed 
pARSC, was transformed to E. coli DH5alpha. The positive clones were selected 
and proliferated. The harvested cells were treated with sonication and the 
supernatant was then subjected to linear sucrose density gradients 
centrifugation (15% to 60%) at 32000 r/min for 4 h at 4 degrees C. The 
virus-like particles, VLP-Cy, were collected at 35% sucrose density. The 
particles were examined by transmission electron microscopy and the spherical 
viral particles of approximately 27 nm in diameter were found. The thiolated 
VLP-Cy was then chemically modified with fluorescein -5'-maleimide. The covalent 
fluorescent labeling was confirmed by absorption analysis, SDS-PAGE and 
MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy. This is the first report of preparation of 
RNA-containing natural fluorescent nanoparticles. The study highlight the 
versatility of MS2 bacteriophage capsids as building blocks for functional 
nanomaterials construction for a variety of application purposes.

Enteric viruses account for most foodborne illness in the United States. The 
objective of this study was to determine whether the isoelectric point (pI) of 
viruses such as feline calicivirus (FCV), echovirus 11, and bacteriophages 
phiX174 and MS2 had any effect on their attachment to butterhead lettuce. The 
adsorption of virus particles to the lettuce was variable. Bacteriophage MS2 was 
the only virus that fit the current Derjaguin-Landau-Verway-Overbeek model of 
virus attachment. Echovirus 11 had the highest affinity to lettuce surface. 
Echovirus 11 appeared to exhibit reversible attachment above its pI, whereas 
below its pI strong adsorption was observed. Adsorption of FCV was at its 
maximum above its pI. Bacteriophage phiX174 exhibited the most complex 
adsorption pattern, with attachment occurring only at the pH extremes (pH 3.0 
and 8.0). These results suggest the current model for virus adsorption to 
sediment does not adequately explain the attachment of virus to lettuce. 
Importantly, the results indirectly suggest that current sample processing 
methods to recover viruses from lettuce may differentially select for the 
recovery of only certain virus types.

validation testing of ultraviolet reactors for water disinfection.

The microbicidal UV fluence under polychromatic radiation from UV lamps is 
typically measured using the DNA absorbance spectrum as a weighting factor for 
the relative wavelength effectiveness. However, this DNA-based weighting does 
not necessarily match the spectral sensitivity of the microorganism being 
tested. Bacillus subtilis spores are often used for UV reactor validation in 
Europe, while MS2 coliphage is typically used for validation testing in the 
United States. These organisms were exposed to quasi-monochromatic UV 
irradiation across the microbicidal spectrum at wavelengths of 214, 230, 240, 
254, 265, 280, and 293 nm. MS2 was three times more sensitive to wavelengths 
near 214 nm compared to the 254 nm output of low-pressure lamps, while B. 
subtilis spores were most sensitive to wavelengths around 265 nm. Use of these 
action spectra, compared to the DNA-based weighting, resulted in differences in 
the calculated polychromatic UV fluence. Consequently, the action spectrum, 
which is specific for each microorganism, has implications on the uncertainty of 
UV fluence determination during validation of reactors with polychromatic UV 
lamps.

To define protection zones around groundwater abstraction wells and safe setback 
distances for artificial recharge systems in watertreatment, quantitative 
information is needed about the removal of microorganisms during soil passage. 
Column experiments were conducted using natural soil and water from an 
infiltration site with fine sandy soil and a river bank infiltration site with 
gravel soil. The removal of phages, bacteria, bacterial spores, and protozoan 
(oo)-cysts was determined at two velocities and compared with field data from 
the same sites. The microbial elimination rate (MER) in both soils was generally 
>2 log, but MER in the gravel soil was higher than that in the fine sandy soil. 
This was attributed to enhanced attachment, related to higher metal-hydroxides 
content. From the high sticking efficiencies (>1) and the low influence of flow 
rate on MER it was deduced that straining played a significant role in the 
removal of Escherichia coli and Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts in the gravel 
soil. Lower removal of oocysts than the 4-5 times smaller E. coli and spores in 
the fine sand indicates that the contribution of straining is variable and needs 
further attention in transport models. Thus, simple extrapolation of grain size 
and particle size to the extent of microbial transport underground is 
inappropriate. Finally, the low MER of indigenous E. coli and Clostridium 
perfringens observed in the soil columns as well as under field conditions and 
the second breakthrough peak found for Cryptosporidium and spores in the fine 
sandy soil upon a change in the feedwater pH indicate a significant role of 
detachment and retardation to microbial transport and the difficulty of 
extrapolation of quantitative column test results to field conditions.

Virus removal by iron coagulation-microfiltration.

This study was undertaken to determine virus removal efficiency by iron 
coagulation followed by microfiltration (MF) in water treatment using the MS2 
bacteriophage (approximately 25 nm diameter) as a tracer virus. Results from 
these bench-scale studies were used to propose a mechanism for virus removal by 
iron coagulation-MF. Ferric chloride was used as coagulant, and the dosages were 
0, 2, 5, and 10 mg/L as Fe(III) with pH adjusted during mixing to 6.3, 7.3 and 
8.3. In the absence of iron-coagulation and with less than 2 mg/L Fe, MF alone 
achieved less than a 0.5 log removal of MS2 virus. However, iron-coagulation 
pretreatment dramatically improved virus removal, especially in the 5-10 mg/L Fe 
dose range, ultimately achieving more than 4-log removal at pH 6.3 with 10-mg/L 
Fe dose. For the 5 and 10 mg/L Fe dosages, decreasing pH in the 8.3-6.3 range 
resulted in significantly greater virus removal. For 0 and 2 mg/L iron dosages, 
decreasing pH in the 8.3-6.3 range also improved virus removal, but to a lesser 
extent. The experimental data indicates negatively charged MS2 viruses first 
adsorbed onto the positively charged iron oxyhydroxide floc particles before 
being removed by MF. MS2 viruses were not inactivated in iron or aluminum 
coagulation as evidenced by the fact that their concentrations before and after 
coagulation, settling, and re-suspension of the coagulated sludge were not 
statistically different.

A synergistic effect between cationic silver and UV radiation (silver-UV 
disinfection) has been observed that can appreciably enhance inactivation of 
viruses. The purpose of this work was to assess the feasibility of this 
technique for drinking water disinfection and evaluate the effects of selected 
impurities, found in fresh water, and common parameters on inactivation of the 
coliphage MS-2 with the silver-UV process. Turbidity (kaolin), calcium hardness, 
carbonate alkalinity, and pH did not significantly degrade inactivation. 
Inactivation was reduced in the presence of chloride, at concentrations greater 
than 30 mg/L, and in water samples with UV-254 absorbance values greater than 
ca. 0.1 cm(-1). Inactivation of MS-2 with silver-UV disinfection was also 
reduced at high phosphate concentrations (above ca. 5 mM). Silver-UV 
inactivation of MS-2 increased with increases in temperature between 10 and 20 
degrees C. Silver-UV inactivation of MS-2 was increased by greater than 1-log 
over UV alone, in two untreated fresh water sources, which indicates that 
silver-UV may be a viable treatment technology. An assessment of operation and 
management costs suggests that an increase in inactivation of MS-2 with 
silver-UV disinfection could be economically beneficial.

and Immunology, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona 85721.

Bacteriophage transport was investigated in laboratory column experiments using 
sandy soil, a controlled field study in a sandy wash, and laboratory experiments 
using fractured rock. In the soil columns, the phage MS-2 exhibited significant 
dispersion and was excluded from 35 to 40% of the void volume but did not 
adsorb. Dispersion in the field was similiar to that observed in the laboratory. 
The phage f2 was largely excluded from the porous matrix of the two 
fractured-rock cores studied, coming through 1.2 and 2.0 times later than 
predicted on the basis of fracture flow alone. Because of matrix diffusion, 
nonsorbing solutes were retarded by over a factor of three relative to fracture 
flow. The time for a solute tracer to equilibrate with the porous matrix of 
6.5-cm-diameter by 25-cm-long cores was measured in days. Results of both 
granular-medium and fractured-rock experiments illustrate the inability of a 
solute tracer to provide estimates for dispersion and effective porosity that 
are applicable to a colloid. Bacteriophage can be used to better estimate the 
maximum subsurface transport rate of colloidal contaminants through a porous 
formation.

Persistence of viruses in desert soils amended with anaerobically digested 
sewage sludge.

Immunology, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona 85721.

Pima County, Ariz., is currently investigating the potential benefits of land 
application of sewage sludge. To assess risks associated with the presence of 
pathogenic enteric viruses present in the sludge, laboratory studies were 
conducted to measure the inactivation rate (k = log(10) reduction per day) of 
poliovirus type 1 and bacteriophages MS2 and PRD-1 in two sludge-amended desert 
agricultural soils (Brazito Sandy Loam and Pima Clay Loam). Under constant 
moisture (approximately -0.05 x 10 Pa for both soils) and temperatures of 15, 
27, and 40 degrees C, the main factors controlling the inactivation of these 
viruses were soil temperature and texture. As the temperature increased from 15 
to 40 degrees C, the inactivation rate increased significantly for poliovirus 
and MS2, whereas, for PRD-1, a significant increase in the inactivation rate was 
observed only at 40 degrees C. Clay loam soils afforded more protection to all 
three viruses than sandy soils. At 15 degrees C, the inactivation rate for MS2 
ranged from 0.366 to 0.394 log(10) reduction per day in clay loam and sandy loam 
soils, respectively. At 27 degrees C, this rate increased to 0.629 log(10) 
reduction per day in clay loam soil and to 0.652 in sandy loam soil. A similar 
trend was observed for poliovirus at 15 degrees C (k = 0.064 log(10) reduction 
per day, clay loam; k = 0.095 log(10) reduction per day, sandy loam) and 27 
degrees C (k = 0.133 log(10) reduction per day, clay loam; k = 0.154 log(10) 
reduction per day, sandy loam). Neither MS2 nor poliovirus was recovered after 
24 h at 40 degrees C. No reduction of PRD-1 was observed after 28 days at 15 
degrees C and after 16 days at 27 degrees C. At 40 degrees C, the inactivation 
rates were 0.208 log(10) reduction per day in amended clay loam soil and 0.282 
log(10) reduction per day in sandy loam soil. Evaporation to less than 5% soil 
moisture completely inactivated all three viruses within 7 days at 15 degrees C, 
within 3 days at 27 degrees C, and within 2 days at 40 degrees C regardless of 
soil type. This suggests that a combination of high soil temperature and rapid 
loss of soil moisture will significantly reduce risks caused by viruses in 
sludge.

Near-UV photocatalytic disinfection was accomplished in aqueous titanium dioxide

after 2 muM ferrous sulfate was added. Hydroxyl radical oxidation, with Fenton

degradation observed.

Several biocides commonly used in disinfection processes as antibacterial and 
antifungal agents were tested for activity against MS2 and K coliphages. MS2 was 
resistant to most biocides; only glutaraldehyde (0.5%) and peracetic acid (1%) 
achieved a 4-log(10) titer reduction in 20 min. In contrast, K phage was 
sensitive to most biocides, being resistant only to phenol (2%) and 
chlorhexidine (1%).

The MS2 coat protein shell is likely assembled under tension: a novel role for 
the MS2 bacteriophage A protein as revealed by small-angle neutron scattering.

Recombinant forms of the bacteriophage MS2 and its RNA-free (empty) MS2 capsid 
were analyzed in solution to determine if RNA content and/or the A (or 
maturation) protein play a role in the global arrangement of the virus protein 
shell. Analysis of the (coat) protein shell of recombinant versions of MS2 that 
lack the A protein revealed dramatic differences compared to wild-type MS2 in 
solution. Specifically, A protein-deficient virus particles form a protein shell 
of between 31(+/-1) A and 37(+/-1) A. This is considerably thicker than the 
protein shell formed by either the wild-type MS2 or the RNA-free MS2 capsid, 
whose protein shells have a thickness of 21(+/-1) A and 25(+/-1) A, 
respectively. Since the A protein is known to separate from the intact MS2 
protein shell after infection, the thin shell form of MS2 represents the 
pre-infection state, while the post-infection state is thick. Interestingly, 
these A protein-dependent differences in the virus protein shell are not seen 
using crystallography, as the crystallization process seems to artificially 
compact the wild-type MS2 virion. Furthermore, when the A protein is absent from 
the virus shell (post-infection), the process of crystallization exerts 
sufficient force to convert the protein shell from the post-infection (thick) 
state to the pre-infection (thin) conformation. In summary, the data are 
consistent with the idea that RNA content or amount does not affect the 
structure of the MS2 virus shell. Rather, the A protein influences the global 
arrangement of the virus coat dramatically, possibly by mediating the storage of 
energy or tension within the protein shell during virus assembly. This tension 
may later be used to eject the MS2 genomic RNA and A protein fragments into the 
host during infection.

Alanine scanning of MS2 coat protein reveals protein-phosphate contacts involved 
in thermodynamic hot spots.

University 2205 Tech Drive, Hogan 2-100, Evanston, IL 60208, USA.

The co-crystal structure of the MS2 coat protein dimer with its RNA operator 
reveals eight amino acid side-chains contacting seven of the RNA phosphates. 
These eight amino acids and five nearby control positions were individually 
changed to an alanine residue and the binding affinities of the mutant proteins 
to the RNA were determined. In general, the data agreed well with the crystal 
structure and previous RNA modification data. Interestingly, amino acid residues 
that are energetically most important for complex formation cluster in the 
middle of the RNA binding interface, forming thermodynamic hot spots, and are 
surrounded by energetically less relevant amino acids. In order to evaluate 
whether or not a given alanine mutation causes a global change in the 
RNA-protein interface, the affinities of the mutant proteins to RNAs containing 
one of 14 backbone modifications spanning the entire interface were determined. 
In three of six protein mutations tested, thermodynamic coupling between the 
site of the mutation and RNA groups that can be even more than 16 A away was 
detected. This suggests that, in some cases, the mutation may subtly alter the 
entire protein-RNA interface.

Salad vegetables exposed to fecal contamination may cause outbreaks of hepatitis 
or gastro-enteritis if they are eaten raw. A procedure, based on elution with 
phosphate-buffered saline and concentration by filtration through membrane 
filters, was developed for the recovery of enteric viruses from salad leaves. 
The method was evaluated using lettuce leaves inoculated with hepatitis A virus 
(HAV), poliovirus, and MS2 bacteriophage. In addition, this method was validated 
by an intra-laboratory study using leaves of various salad vegetables inoculated 
with MS2 phage. The French standard NF V 03-110 was used to establish the 
general principle and the technical protocol of the validation procedure. Linear 
regression models describing the quantitative reactions were good fits to data 
in the whole range of viral concentrations tested, which was from about 1 to 4 
log plaque-forming units (PFU) per 25 g of lettuce. The fractions of inoculated 
viruses recovered were estimated to be about 64% for HAV, 18% for poliovirus, 
and 29% for MS2. No significant effect of the food matrix was found using 
various types of salad vegetable (butter lettuce, iceberg lettuce, romaine 
lettuce, witloof chicory, curly endive, corn salad, rocket and watercress). 
Moreover, the variance of the results was constant for all levels of virus 
contamination within the experimental range. Intermediate reproducibility 
experiments were also performed to allow calculation of the uncertainty factor, 
which was found to be 0.58 log PFU/25 g. When used in association with phage 
enumeration, this validated procedure is rapid enough to be used for screening 
salad vegetables for evaluation of the efficacy of processes for control of 
pathogenic microorganisms on such foods.

Bacteriophage MS2 is used in place of pathogenic viruses in a wide variety of 
studies that range from testing of compounds for disinfecting surfaces to 
studying environmental transport and fate of pathogenic viruses in groundwater. 
MS2 is also used as a pathogen simulant in the research, development, and 
testing (including open air tests) of methods, systems, and devices for the 
detection of pathogens in both the battlefield and homeland defense settings. 
PCR is often used as either an integral part of such detection systems or as a 
reference method to assess the sensitivity and specificity of microbial 
detection. To facilitate the detection of MS2 by PCR, we describe here a set of 
real-time fluorogenic reverse transcription-PCR assays. The sensitivity of the 
assays (performed with primer pairs and corresponding dye-labeled probes) ranged 
from 0.4 to 40 fg of MS2 genomic RNA (200 to 20,000 genome equivalents). We also 
demonstrate the usefulness of the primer pairs in assays without dye-labeled 
probe that included the DNA-binding dye SYBR green. None of the assays gave 
false-positive results when tested against 400 pg of several non-MS2 nucleic 
acid targets.

Science, Tucson, AZ 85706, USA.

The objective of this study was to investigate leaching and transport of 
viruses, specifically those of an indigenous coliphage host specific to 
Escherichia coli ATTC 15597 (i.e., MS-2), from a biosolid-soil matrix. Serial 
extractions of 2% and 7% (solids) class B biosolid matrices were performed to 
determine the number of phage present in the biosolids and to evaluate their 
general leaching potential. Significant concentrations of coliphage were removed 
from the biosolids for each sequential extraction, indicating that many phage 
remained associated with the solid phase. The fact that phage was associated 
with or attached to solid particles appeared to influence the potential for 
release and subsequent transport of phage under saturated-flow conditions, which 
was examined in a series of column experiments. The results indicated that less 
than 8% of the indigenous coliphage initially present in the biosolids leached 
out of the biosolid-soil matrix. A fraction of this was subsequently transported 
through the sandy porous medium with minimal retention. The minimal retention 
observed for the indigenous phage, once released from the biosolids, was 
consistent with the results of control experiments conducted to examine MS-2 
transport through the porous medium.

The RNA bacteriophages, a group that includes phages Qbeta and MS2, have a 
number of potential bionanotechnological applications, including cell specific 
drug delivery and as substrates for the formation of novel materials. Despite 
extensive sequence identity between their coat protein subunits, and an almost 
identical three-dimensional fold, Qbeta and MS2 capsids have dramatically 
different thermal stabilities. The increased stability of Qbeta has been 
correlated with the inter-subunit disulphide bonds present in that capsid and 
not present in MS2. We have tested this hypothesis directly using mass 
spectrometry. Analysis of the dissociated coat protein subunits suggests that 
inter-molecular disulphides are formed at the capsid five-fold but may not be at 
the three-fold axes. This conclusion has been tested by engineering disulphide 
cross-links into either the five-fold or three-fold positions of the recombinant 
MS2 capsid. Five-fold cross-linking results in a mutant with stability 
properties similar to those of Qbeta. Three-fold cross-linking results in a 
mutant unable to assemble T = 3 shells, implying that five-fold structures are 
on pathway to capsid assembly in these phages. The results demonstrate how it is 
possible to redesign the physical properties of phage shells and may be of 
general relevance to future applications of viruses and virus-like particles.

Charge reduced electrospray size spectrometry of mega- and gigadalton complexes: 
whole viruses and virus fragments.

The ability to analyze and identify large macromolecular complexes whose 
molecular weight is beyond the analyzable range of mass spectrometry is of great 
interest. The size of such complexes makes them suitable for analysis via 
mobility size spectrometry. In this work, charge reduced electrospray size 
spectrometry was used for the analysis of bacteriophage viruses with total 
molecular masses ranging from 3.6 MDa up to the gigadalton range. The 
electrospray source used was operated in "cone jet" mode with a mean droplet 
diameter of 170.56 nm. Bacteriophage MS2 was found to have a mobility diameter 
of 24.13 +/- 0.06 nm and remain highly viable after the electrospray process. 
Larger bacteriophages T2 and T4 have lengths greater than the diameter of the 
electrospray jet and droplets; thus, they could not be completely enclosed and 
were found to fragment at the virus capsid head-tail noncovalent interface 
during either the jet formation or jet breakup process. No viable T2 or T4 
virions were detectable after being electrosprayed. While the exact mechanism of 
fragmentation could not be determined, it is proposed here that macromolecular 
fragmentation at noncovalent interfaces occurs due to mechanically and 
electrically induced stresses during jet formation and jet breakup. 
Bacteriophage T4 capsid heads were found to be statistically significantly 
larger than bacteriophage T2 capsid heads, with a mean peak diameter of 88.32 
+/- 1.02 nm for T4 and 87.03 +/- 0.18 nm for T2. While capsid head fragments 
were detectable, tail and tail-fiber fragments could not be detected by size 
spectrometric analysis. This is attributed to the fact that the contractile 
tails of bacteriophage T2 and T4 virions mechanically deform to a varying degree 
while confined within the smaller jet and droplets. Further evidence of 
contractile tail deformation during the electrospray process was found by 
measuring the size spectrum of bacteriophage lambda, which has a noncontractile 
tail. Bacteriophage lambda had two distinct peaks in its size spectrum, one 
corresponding to the capsid head and the other corresponding to the tail 
fragment. Size spectrometry was also used for rapid quantification of virus 
concentrations, thus demonstrating its full capabilities in the analysis of 
large macromolecular complexes.

The genes of the RNA-containing bacteriophage MS2 were individually inserted 
into thermoinducible expression plasmids under control of the phage lambda P(L) 
promoter. Three phage-coded proteins (A-protein, coat protein, and replicase) 
were expressed at high efficiency. Induced cultures specifically complemented 
superinfecting amber mutants of phage MS2. Regulatory mechanisms operative 
during the natural infection cycle of the phage were reproduced by the plasmid 
expression system.

Do N95 respirators provide 95% protection level against airborne viruses, and 
how adequate are surgical masks?

Health, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA.

BACKGROUND: Respiratory protection devices are used to protect the wearers from 
inhaling particles suspended in the air. Filtering face piece respirators are 
usually tested utilizing nonbiologic particles, whereas their use often aims at 
reducing exposure to biologic aerosols, including infectious agents such as 
viruses and bacteria.
METHODS: The performance of 2 types of N95 half-mask, filtering face piece 
respirators and 2 types of surgical masks were determined. The collection 
efficiency of these respiratory protection devices was investigated using MS2 
virus (a nonharmful simulant of several pathogens). The virions were detected in 
the particle size range of 10 to 80 nm.
RESULTS: The results indicate that the penetration of virions through the 
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified N95 
respirators can exceed an expected level of 5%. As anticipated, the tested 
surgical masks showed a much higher particle penetration because they are known 
to be less efficient than the N95 respirators. The 2 surgical masks, which 
originated from the same manufacturer, showed tremendously different penetration 
levels of the MS2 virions: 20.5% and 84.5%, respectively, at an inhalation flow 
rate of 85 L/min.
CONCLUSION: The N95 filtering face piece respirators may not provide the 
expected protection level against small virions. Some surgical masks may let a 
significant fraction of airborne viruses penetrate through their filters, 
providing very low protection against aerosolized infectious agents in the size 
range of 10 to 80 nm. It should be noted that the surgical masks are primarily 
designed to protect the environment from the wearer, whereas the respirators are 
supposed to protect the wearer from the environment.

Sequence-specific interactions between RNA stem-loops and coat protein (CP) 
subunits play vital roles in the life cycles of the RNA bacteriophages, e.g., by 
allowing translational repression of their replicase cistrons and tagging their 
own RNA genomes for encapsidation. The CPs of bacteriophages Qbeta and MS2 each 
discriminate in favor of their cognate translational operators, even in the 
presence of closely related operators from other phages in vivo. Discrete 
mutations within the MS2 CP have been shown to relax this discrimination in 
vitro. We have determined the structures of eight complexes between such mutants 
and both MS2 and Qbeta stem-loops with X-ray crystallography. In conjunction 
with previously determined in vivo repression data, the structures enable us to 
propose the molecular basis for the discrimination mechanism.

Virus retention and transport in chemically heterogeneous porous media under 
saturated and unsaturated flow conditions.

Han J(1), Jin Y, Willson CS.

Author information:
(1)Department of Plant and Soil Sciences, University of Delaware, Newark, 
Delaware 19716, USA.

Retention and transport of colloids and microorganisms are complex processes, 
especially in the vadose zone due to the more complicated water flow regime and 
additional interfacial reactions involved. In this study, we examined the 
retention and transport behavior of two bacteriophages, MS-2 and phiX174, in 
homogeneous and chemically heterogeneous media under variably saturated 
conditions. Column experiments with glass beads (treated to have either 
hydrophilic or hydrophobic surface properties) were conducted using a 
phosphate-buffered saline solution at different pore water ionic strengths 
ranging from 0.025 to 0.163 M. In columns packed with 100% hydrophilic glass 
beads, retention of the viruses increased with decreasing water content and 
increasing ionic strength, a result similar to those reported in the literature. 
However, greater retention of both MS-2 and phiX174 was observed in saturated 
columns than in unsaturated columns packed with a 1:1 mixture of hydrophilic and 
hydrophobic glass beads, especially at high ionic strengths. This result 
contradicts the common belief that viruses (and colloids in general) are subject 
to greater removal in unsaturated media. Our study suggests that while the 
mechanisms controlling colloid interfacial interactions (i.e., attachment on 
solid-water and air-water interfaces and film straining) on the pore scale are 
relevant, nonuniform wetting conditions due to heterogeneous grain surface 
hydrophobicity can strongly influence water flow and phase interconnection. 
Under these conditions, hydrodynamic effects on the mesopore scale will dominate 
pore-scale interfacial reactions in controlling the extent of colloid retention 
and movement in unsaturated media.

Dissecting the role of protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions in 
MS2 bacteriophage stability.

do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

To investigate the role of protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions 
in virus assembly, we compared the stabilities of native bacteriophage MS2, 
virus-like particles (VLPs) containing nonviral RNAs, and an assembly-defective 
coat protein mutant (dlFG) and its single-chain variant (sc-dlFG). Physical 
(high pressure) and chemical (urea and guanidine hydrochloride) agents were used 
to promote virus disassembly and protein denaturation, and the changes in virus 
and protein structure were monitored by measuring tryptophan intrinsic 
fluorescence, bis-ANS probe fluorescence, and light scattering. We found that 
VLPs dissociate into capsid proteins that remain folded and more stable than the 
proteins dissociated from authentic particles. The proposed model is that the 
capsid disassembles but the protein remains bound to the heterologous RNA 
encased by VLPs. The dlFG dimerizes correctly, but fails to assemble into 
capsids, because it lacks the 15-amino acid FG loop involved in inter-dimer 
interactions at the viral fivefold and quasi-sixfold axes. This protein was very 
unstable and, when compared with the dissociation/denaturation of the VLPs and 
the wild-type virus, it was much more susceptible to chemical and physical 
perturbation. Genetic fusion of the two subunits of the dimer in the 
single-chain dimer sc-dlFG stabilized the protein, as did the presence of 34-bp 
poly(GC) DNA. These studies reveal mechanisms by which interactions in the 
capsid lattice can be sufficiently stable and specific to ensure assembly, and 
they shed light on the processes that lead to the formation of infectious viral 
particles.

Evaluation of the factors controlling the time-dependent inactivation rate 
coefficients of bacteriophage MS2 and PRD1.

California-Irvine, California 92717, USA. randers@usgs.gov

Static and dynamic batch experiments were conducted to study the effects of 
temperature and the presence of sand on the inactivation of bacteriophage MS2 
and PRD1. The experimental data suggested that the inactivation process can be 
satisfactorily represented by a pseudo-first-order expression with 
time-dependent rate coefficients. The time-dependent rate coefficients were used 
to determine pertinent thermodynamic properties required for the analysis of the 
molecular processes involved in the inactivation of each bacteriophage. A 
combination of high temperature and the presence of sand appears to produce the 
greatest disruption to the surrounding protein coat of MS2. However, the lower 
activation energies for PRD1 indicate a weaker dependence of the inactivation 
rate on temperature. Instead, the presence of air-liquid and air-solid 
interfaces appears to produce the greatest damage to specific viral components 
that are related to infection. These results indicate the importance of using 
thermodynamic parameters based on the time-dependent inactivation model to 
better predict the inactivation of viruses in groundwater.

Analysing mass balance of viruses in a coagulation-ceramic microfiltration 
hybrid system by a combination of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and 
the plaque forming units (PFU) method.

Virus removal experiments using river water spiked with bacteriophages were 
conducted by an in-line coagulation-ceramic microfiltration hybrid system to 
investigate the effects of filtration flux (62.5 and 125 L/(m2 x h)) and type of 
virus (Qbeta and MS2) on virus removal. In addition, the mass balance of viruses 
through the hybrid system was analysed by quantifying the infectious and 
inactive viruses by a combination of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method 
and the plaque forming units (PFU) method. Even when the system was operated at 
high filtration flux (125 L/(m2 x h)), high virus removal (> 6 log) with short 
coagulation time (2.4 s) was successfully achieved by dosing polyaluminium 
chloride (PACI) at more than 1.08 mg-Al/L. Removal performances were different 
between Qbeta and MS2, although their diameters are almost the same: greater 
virus removal was achieved for MS2 at PACI dosing of 0.54 mg-Al/L, and for Qbeta 
at PACI dosing of more than 1.08 mg-Al/L. The combination of the PCR and PFU 
methods revealed that two phenomena, adsorption to/entrapment in aluminium floc 
and virucidal activity of PACI, partially account for the high virus removal in 
the coagulation-MF hybrid system.

A set of pilot filters packed with Zeolite filter media treated with a 
quaternary ammonium chloride (QAC) were evaluated to verify the proof of concept 
of their combined antimicrobial capabilities. Escherichia coli was removed and 
inactivated the most (2.83 log), followed by MS-2 (2.75 log), Klebsiella 
terriena (2.21 log), PRD-1 (1.95 log), Chlorella vulgaris (1.92 log), and 
Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts (1.78 log). Especially, inactivation of C. parvum 
oocysts (1.19 log) was higher than physical removal (0.54 log). The data suggest 
that QAC-treated Zeolite in the pilot filters has microbial inactivation 
capabilities and may have useful applications in other types of filter media.

A nanoparticle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent was developed by 
conjugation of more than 500 gadolinium chelate groups onto a viral capsid. The 
high density of paramagnetic centers and slow tumbling rate of modified MS2 
capsids provided enhanced T1 relaxivities up to 7200 mM-1s-1 per particle. A 
bimodal imaging agent was generated by sequential conjugation of fluorescein and 
Gd3+ chelate. These results illustrate the potential for engineering natural

Effect of temperature on the survival of F-specific RNA coliphage, feline

We compared the survival of F-specific RNA coliphage MS2, feline calicivirus, 
and E. coli in normal tap water and in tap water treated to an initial 
concentration of 50 ppm free chlorine and held at 4 degrees C, 25 degrees C, or 
37 degrees C for up to 28 days. Our aim was to determine which of these two 
organisms (coliphage or E. coli) was better at indicating norovirus survival 
under the conditions of the experiment. There was a relatively rapid decline of 
FCV and E. coli in 50 ppm chlorine treated water and both organisms were 
undetectable within one day irrespective of the temperature. In contrast, FRNA 
phage survived for 7 to 14 days in 50 ppm chlorine treated water at all 
temperatures. All organisms survived for 28 days in tap water at 4 degrees C, 
but FCV was undetectable on day 21 and day 7 at 25 degrees C and 37 degrees C, 
respectively. Greater survival of FRNA phage compared to E. coli in 50 ppm 
chlorine treated water suggests that these organisms should be further 
investigated as indicators of norovirus in depurated shellfish, sanitized 
produce, and treated wastewater which are all subject to high-level chlorine 
treatment.

Structural constraints and mutational bias in the evolutionary restoration of a 
severe deletion in RNA phage MS2.

A 4-nucleotide (nt) deletion was made in the 36-nt-long intercistronic region 
separating the coat and replicase genes of the single-stranded RNA phage MS2. 
This region is the focus of several RNA structures conferring high fitness. One 
such element is the operator hairpin, which, in the course of infection, will 
bind a coat-protein dimer, thereby precluding further replicase synthesis and 
initiating encapsidation. Another structure is a long-distance base pairing (MJ) 
controlling replicase expression. The 4-nt deletion does not directly affect the 
operator hairpin but it disrupts the MJ pairing. Its main effect, however, is a 
frame shift in the overlapping lysis gene. This gene starts in the upstream coat 
gene, runs through the 36-nt-long intercistronic region, and ends in the 
downstream replicase cistron. Here we report and interpret the spectrum of 
solutions that emerges when the crippled phage is evolved. Four different 
solutions were obtained by sequencing 40 plaques. Three had cured the frame 
shift in the lysis gene by inserting one nt in the loop of the operator hairpin 
causing its inactivation. Yet these low-fitness revertants could further improve 
themselves when evolved. The inactivated operator was replaced by a substitute 
and thereafter these revertants found several ways to restore control over the 
replicase gene. To allow for the evolutionary enrichment of low-probability but 
high-fitness revertants, we passaged lysate samples before plating. Revertants 
obtained in this way also restored the frame shift, but not at the expense of 
the operator. By taking larger and larger lysates samples for such bulk 
evolution, ever higher-fitness and lower-frequency revertants surfaced. Only one 
made it back to wild type. As a rule, however, revertants moved further and 
further away from the wild-type sequence because restorative mutations are, in 
the majority of cases, selected for their capacity to improve the phenotype by 
optimizing one of several potential alternative RNA foldings that emerge as a 
result of the initial deletion. This illustrates the role of structural 
constraints which limit the path of subsequent restorative mutations.

Point-of-use filters containing granular activated carbon (GAC) are an effective 
method for removing certain chemicals from water, but their ability to remove 
bacteria and viruses has been relatively untested. Collision efficiencies 
(alpha) were determined using clean-bed filtration theory for two bacteria 
(Raoutella terrigena 33257 and Escherichia coli 25922), a bacteriophage (MS2), 
and latex microspheres for four GAC samples. These GAC samples had particle size 
distributions that were bimodal, but only a single particle diameter can be used 
in the filtration equation. Therefore, consistent with previous reports, we used 
a particle diameter based on the smallest diameter of the particles (derived 
from the projected areas of 10% of the smallest particles). The bacterial 
collision efficiencies calculated using the filtration model were high (0.8 < or 
= alpha < or = 4.9), indicating that GAC was an effective capture material. 
Collision efficiencies greater than unity reflect an underestimation of the 
collision frequency, likely as a result of particle roughness and wide GAC size 
distributions. The collision efficiencies for microspheres (0.7 < or = alpha < 
or = 3.5) were similar to those obtained for bacteria, suggesting that the 
microspheres were a reasonable surrogate for the bacteria. The bacteriophage 
collision efficiencies ranged from > or = 0.2 to < or = 0.4. The predicted 
levels of removal for 1-cm-thick carbon beds ranged from 0.8 to 3 log for the 
bacteria and from 0.3 to 1.0 log for the phage. These tests demonstrated that 
GAC can be an effective material for removal of bacteria and phage and that GAC 
particle size is a more important factor than relative stickiness for effective 
particle removal.

We have developed a one-tube reverse transcription (RT)-PCR method using the 
real-time TaqMan PCR system for the detection of norovirus genogroup I (NV GGI). 
By introduction of a novel probe based on locked nucleic acid technology, we 
enhanced the sensitivity of the assay compared to those of conventional TaqMan 
probes. The sensitivity of the NV GGI RT-PCR was determined by probit analysis 
with defined RNA standards and quantified norovirus isolates to 711 copies/ml 
(95% detection limit). In order to detect PCR inhibition, we included a 
heterologous internal control (IC) system based on phage MS2. This internally 
controlled RT-PCR was tested on different real-time PCR platforms, LightCycler, 
Rotorgene, Mastercycler EP realplex, and ABI Prism. Compared to the assay 
without an IC, the duplex RT-PCR exhibited no reduction in sensitivity in 
clinical samples. In combination with an established NV GGII real-time RT-PCR, 
we used the novel assay in a routine assay for diagnosis of clinical and 
food-borne norovirus infection. We applied this novel assay to analyze outbreaks 
of nonbacterial acute gastroenteritis. Norovirus of GGI was detected in these 
outbreaks. Sequence and similarity plot analysis of open reading frame 1 (ORF1) 
and ORF2 showed two genotypes, GGI/2 and GGI/4, in semiclosed communities.

Mechanisms of coliphage transport and fate in the presence and absence of manure 
suspension were studied in saturated column experiments. In the presence of 
manure suspension, little inactivation of indigenous somatic coliphage occurred 
and the transport was controlled by deposition. The deposition followed a power 
law distribution with depth, and the magnitude increased with decreasing sand 
size. Comparison of the cumulative size distribution of manure components in the 
suspension initially and after passage through sand, suggested that particles 
retained by mechanical filtration and/or straining decreased the effective pore 
size and potentially induced straining of the somatic coliphage. A 2-site 
kinetic deposition model was used to estimate the magnitudes of attachment and 
straining in the presence of manure suspension, and provided a good description 
of the data. Modeling results indicated that straining accounted for 16 to 42% 
of the deposited somatic coliphage, and that both straining and attachment 
increased with decreasing sand size due to smaller pores and higher surface 
area, respectively. In the absence of manure suspension, phiX174 (a 
representative somatic coliphage) and MS2 (a male-specific RNA coliphage) 
transport was controlled by inactivation induced by the solid phase. This 
conclusion was based on comparison of coliphage transport behavior at 5 and 20 
degrees C, mass balance information, and numerical modeling. Comparison of 
somatic coliphage transport data in the presence and absence of manure 
suspension revealed much higher effluent concentrations in the presence of 
manure. This difference was attributed to lower inactivation and higher 
detachment rates. The observed coliphage transport behavior suggests that 
survival of viruses may be extended in the presence of manure suspensions, and 
that transport studies conducted in the absence of manure suspension may not 
accurately characterize the transport potential of viruses in 
manure-contaminated environments.

Impact of iron particles in groundwater on the UV inactivation of bacteriophages 
MS2 and T4.

AIMS: To investigate the impact of iron particles in groundwater on the 
inactivation of two model viruses, bacteriophages MS2 and T4, by 254-nm 
ultraviolet (UV) light.
METHODS AND RESULTS: One-litre samples of groundwater with high iron content 
(from the Indianapolis Water Company, mean dissolved iron concentration 1.3 mg 
l(-1)) were stirred vigorously while exposed to air, which oxidized and 
precipitated the dissolved iron. In parallel samples, 
ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (EDTA) was added to chelate the iron and 
prevent formation of iron precipitate. The average turbidity in the samples 
without EDTA (called the 'raw' samples) after 210 min of stirring was 2.7 +/- 
0.1 NTU while the average turbidity of the samples containing EDTA (called the 
'preserved' samples) was 1.0 +/- 0.1 NTU. 'Raw' and 'preserved' samples 
containing bacteriophage MS2 were exposed to 254-nm UV light at doses of 20, 40, 
or 60 mJ (cm(2))(-1), while samples containing bacteriophage T4 were exposed to 
2 or 5 mJ (cm(2))(-1), using a low pressure UV collimated beam. The UV 
inactivation of both phages in the 'raw' groundwater was lower than in the 
EDTA-'preserved' groundwater to a statistically significant degree (alpha = 
0.05), due to the association of phage with the UV-absorbing iron precipitate 
particles. A phage elution technique confirmed that a large fraction of the 
phage that survived the UV exposures were particle-associated.
CONCLUSIONS: Phages that are associated with iron oxide particles in groundwater 
are shielded from UV light to a measurable and statistically significant degree 
at a turbidity level of 2.7 NTU when the phage particle association is induced 
under experimental conditions.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: While the particle association of the 
phage in this study was induced experimentally, the findings provide further 
evidence that certain particles in natural waters and wastewaters (e.g. iron 
oxide particles) may have the potential to shield viruses from UV light.

Pressure inactivation of four types of coliphages, varphiX 174 (ssDNA virus), 
MS2 (ssRNA virus), lambda imm434 (dsDNA virus) and T4 (dsDNA virus), was studied 
to evaluate their potential as human enteric viral surrogates for use in 
validation of commercial pressure processing treatments. Phage varphiX 174 
demonstrated an unexpected high resistance to pressure with no more than 
1-log(10) reduction observed following exposures to 350-600 MPa. There was no 
greater than 1-log(10) reduction below 500 MPa for MS2 in modified 
phosphate-buffered saline, but a 3.3-log(10) reduction was observed for MS2 
pressurized at 600 MPa. Coliphages lambda imm434 and T4 were relatively 
sensitive to pressure in demonstrating inactivation at 350 MPa. At 21 degrees C, 
lambda imm434 was inactivated in modified phosphate-buffered saline or 
Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium plus 5% fetal bovine sera by at least 
7.5-log(10) when exposed to 400 MPa for 5 min. Treatment at 450 MPa for 5 min 
was necessary to obtain a log(10) reduction of 6-7 for T4.

composition, application rate, and soil type.

The column studies presented in this paper simulated the infiltrative surface of 
onsite wastewater systems where effluent is applied and where a biomat may form. 
Two bacteriophages, MS-2 and PRD-1, were used as surrogates for human pathogenic 
enteric viruses during two tracer tests. A vacuum manifold was used to simulate 
the drainage effects of an underlying unsaturated soil profile, allowing for the 
collection of percolate samples at 4 cm immediately below the infiltrative 
surface. The impact of effluent applied (septic tank effluent (STE) or a 
simulated ground water), soil type (medium sand or sandy loam), hydraulic 
loading rate (5 or 25 cm/day) and method of application (four equivalent daily 
doses or 24 equivalent micro-doses per day) on the removal of viruses were 
investigated. These unsaturated mini column experiments demonstrated that the 
removal of viruses within an infiltrative surface zone (of approximately 4 cm) 
generally improved over time under the conditions studied. An exception occurred 
in sand-filled columns dosed with STE where the removal of PRD-1 decreased after 
a period of effluent application. Statistical analysis conducted on the 
calculated percent removal demonstrated that the quality of the effluent applied 
to the infiltrative surface is important for removal of MS-2 and PRD-1. 
Hydraulic loading rate also proved important in the removal of viruses. At the 
time of tracer test 2, columns dosed at the higher HLR (25 cm/day) had higher 
percent removals for both MS-2 and PRD-1. Soil type altered the removal of PRD-1 
at the time of the second tracer test, at which time sandy loam had higher 
removal rates for PRD-1. No significant differences were observed between 
columns dosed four times daily and those dosed 24 times daily for either 
bacteriophage at either of the tracer test time points. These data suggest that 
over a relatively short period of operation the infiltrative surface of soil 
based wastewater treatment systems can achieve much higher removal then 
initially measured shortly after startup.

We solved the structures of the single-stranded RNA bacteriophages Qbeta, PP7 
and AP205 by cryo-electron microscopy. On the outside, the symmetrized electron 
density maps resemble the previously described cryo-electron microscopy 
structure of MS2. RNA density is present inside the capsids, suggesting that the 
genomic RNA of Qbeta, PP7 and AP205, analogous to MS2, contains many coat 
protein-binding sites in addition to the hairpin on which assembly and packaging 
are initiated. All four bacteriophages harbour the same overall arrangement of 
the RNA, which is a unique combination of both triangles and pentagons. This 
combination has not been found in other icosahedral viruses, in which the RNA 
structures are either triangular or pentagonal. Strikingly, the unique RNA 
packing of the Leviviridae appears to deploy the most efficient method of RNA 
storage by obeying icosahedral symmetry.

Preparation of His-tagged armored RNA phage particles as a control for real-time 
reverse transcription-PCR detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus.

Armored RNA has been increasingly used as both an external and internal positive 
control in nucleic acid-based assays for RNA virus. In order to facilitate 
armored RNA purification, a His6 tag was introduced into the loop region of the 
MS2 coat protein, which allows the exposure of multiple His tags on the surface 
during armored RNA assembly. The His-tagged armored RNA particles were purified 
to homogeneity and verified to be free of DNA contamination in a single run of 
affinity chromatography. A fragment of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus (SARS-CoV) genome targeted for SARS-CoV detection was chosen for an 
external positive control preparation. A plant-specific gene sequence was chosen 
for a universal noncompetitive internal positive control preparation. Both 
controls were purified by Co2+ affinity chromatography and were included in a 
real-time reverse transcription-PCR assay for SARS-CoV. The noncompetitive 
internal positive control can be added to clinical samples before RNA extraction 
and enables the identification of potential inhibitive effects without 
interfering with target amplification. The external control could be used for 
the quantification of viral loads in clinical samples.

Adsorption of viruses to soil: impact of anaerobic treatment.

Davis JA(1), Farrah SR, Wilkie AC.

Gainesville, FL 32611, USA.

The adsorption of viruses in untreated flushed dairy manure wastewater (FDMW), 
anaerobically digested flushed dairy manure wastewater (ADFDMW) and groundwater 
to sandy soil was investigated. Batch adsorption studies showed differential 
adsorption of viruses in groundwater to soil. Less than 75% of PRD1 and MS2 
added to groundwater adsorbed after 1 h, but greater than 95% of phiX174 and 
poliovirus 1 adsorbed to the soil. Adsorption differences in groundwater were 
related to the isoelectric points of the viruses. Suspending phages in untreated 
and treated wastewater reduced adsorption compared with groundwater. For MS2, 
more phages were adsorbed using ADFDMW than with FDMW. Adsorption of poliovirus 
1 was not affected by FDMW and ADFDMW. Small column studies (6 x 2.5 cm) 
produced a similar trend in that adsorption was observed with groundwater and 
both FDMW and ADFDMW reduced virus adsorption. Groundwater, FDMW or ADFDMW did 
not affect the adsorption of poliovirus 1 in column studies. The major 
difference between FDMW and ADFDMW was in mobilisation of adsorbed viruses. The 
application of FDMW to soil columns with adsorbed viruses caused significantly 
more viruses to be mobilised than did the application of rainwater or ADFDMW. 
These results showed that treating FDMW by anaerobic digestion increased the 
adsorption of viruses to soil and decreased detachment of adsorbed viruses. As 
the potential for new zoonotic pathogens becomes known, the treatment of animal 
wastes may become mandatory. The assessment and management of viruses in manure 
for addressing possible risk to animal and human health is of interest.

Inactivation of poliovirus 1 and F-specific RNA phages and degradation of their 
genomes by UV irradiation at 254 nanometers.

Several models (animal caliciviruses, poliovirus 1 [PV1], and F-specific RNA 
bacteriophages) are usually used to predict inactivation of nonculturable 
viruses. For the same UV fluence, viral inactivation observed in the literature 
varies from 0 to 5 logs according to the models and the methods (infectivity 
versus molecular biology). The lack of knowledge concerning the mechanisms of 
inactivation due to UV prevents us from selecting the best model. In this 
context, determining if viral genome degradation may explain the loss of 
infectivity under UV radiation becomes essential. Thus, four virus models (PV1 
and three F-specific RNA phages: MS2, GA, and Qbeta) were exposed to UV 
radiation from 0 to 150 mJ.cm-2. PV1 is the least-resistant virus, while MS2 and 
GA phages are the most resistant, with phage Qbeta having an intermediate 
sensitivity; respectively, 6-log, 2.3-log, 2.5-log, and 4-log decreases for 50 
mJ.cm-2. In parallel, analysis of RNA degradation demonstrated that this 
phenomenon depends on the fragment size for PV1 as well as for MS2. Long 
fragments (above 2,000 bases) for PV1 and MS2 fell rapidly to the background 
level (>1.3-log decrease) for 20 mJ.cm-2 and 60 mJ.cm-2, respectively. 
Nevertheless, the size of the viral RNA is not the only factor affecting 
UV-induced RNA degradation, since viral RNA was more rapidly degraded in PV1 
than in the MS2 phage with a similar size. Finally, extrapolation of 
inactivation and UV-induced RNA degradation kinetics highlights that genome 
degradation could fully explain UV-induced viral inactivation.

The effects of UV intensity and turbidity on selected microbial indicator 
inactivation were investigated. Results showed that UV disinfection was 
effective in killing all the selected microbial indicators, the resistance order 
of the microorganisms was as follows: MS-2 coliphage > Bacillus subtilis > E. 
coli > Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. UV intensity had influence on 
the inactivation of all the microorganisms, high UV disinfection efficency was 
obtained with higher UV intensity. Turbidity had impact on the bacteria 
inactivation rate, but there was no evidence that turbidity had any negative 
contribution to MS-2 coliphage. Under the same UV dosage, higher UV intensity 
could overcome the negative influence of turbidity on UV performance, enhanced 
microorganism inactivation effect in turbidity water.

Solubilization and stabilization of bacteriophage MS2 in organic solvents.

Johnson HR(1), Hooker JM, Francis MB, Clark DS.

Author information:

California 94720, USA.

Several techniques were examined for the solubilization of bacteriophage MS2 in 
organic solvents. Direct extraction of the MS2 from an aqueous phase into 
isooctane containing 2 mM AOT, a proven approach for the organic solubilization 
of many proteins, was not successful. However, predried samples of MS2 were 
solubilized through the direct addition of organic solvents containing 500 mM 
AOT. As an alternative procedure, reverse micelles containing aqueous solutions 
of MS2 were prepared in isooctane using AOT, dehydrated through solvent 
evaporation and azeotropic drying, and resolubilized in a solvent of choice. The 
structure and microenvironment of organic-solubilized MS2 were investigated by 
UV absorbance, the fluorescence emission of an attached solvatochromatic dye, 
tryptophan fluorescence, and atomic force microscopy, all of which contributed 
evidence for a fully assembled capsid in the organic solvent. The solubilized 
MS2 was derivatized with stearic acid in chloroform, illustrating that 
bioconjugation reactions can be performed on organic-solubilized capsids using 
reagents that are completely insoluble in water. Furthermore, the 
organic-solubilized phage remained infectious after heating at 90 degrees C for 
20 min, whereas phage in aqueous buffer or dried with nitrogen were nonviable 
following the heat treatment protocol. The extended range of available chemical 
modifications and the enhanced thermal stability of the organic-solubilized 
capsids bodes well for the formulation of storage-stable vaccines predicated on 
reactions in or exposure to organic media.

Lytic phages infect their bacterial hosts, use the host machinery to replicate, 
and finally lyse and kill their hosts, releasing progeny phages. Various 
mathematical models have been developed that describe these phage-host viral 
dynamics. The aim of this study was to determine which of these models best 
describes the viral dynamics of lytic RNA phage MS2 and its host Escherichia 
coli C-3000. Experimental data consisted of uninfected and infected bacterial 
cell densities, free phage density, and substrate concentration. Parameters of 
various models were either determined directly through other experimental 
techniques or estimated using regression analysis of the experimental data. The 
models were evaluated using a Bayesian-based model discrimination technique. 
Through model discrimination it was shown that phage-resistant cells inhibited 
the growth of phage population. It was also shown that the uninfected bacterial 
population was a quasispecies consisting of phage-sensitive and phage-resistant 
bacterial cells. When there was a phage attack the phage-sensitive cells died 
out and the phage-resistant cells were selected for and became the dominant 
strain of the bacterial population.

The study reported here looked at the survival of microorganisms (heterotrophic 
plate counts, total coliforms, E. coli, and bacterial spores) in a consumer-type 
microwave oven. Kitchen sponges, scrubbing pads, and syringes were 
experimentally contaminated with wastewater and subsequently exposed to 
microwave radiation. At 100 percent power level, it was found that the 
heterotrophic plate count (i.e., total bacterial count) of the wastewater was 
reduced by more that 99 percent within 1 to 2 minutes, and the total coliform 
and E. coli were totally inactivated after 30 seconds of microwave radiation. 
Bacterial phage MS2 was totally inactivated within 1 to 2 minutes. Spores of 
Bacillus cereus were more resistant than the other microorganisms tested, and 
were completely eradicated only after 4-minute irradiation. Similar inactivation 
rates were obtained in wastewater-contaminated scrubbing pads. Microorganisms 
attached to plastic syringes were more resistant to microwave irradiation than 
those associated with kitchen sponges or scrubbing pads. It took 10 minutes for 
total inactivation of the heterotrophic plate count and 4 minutes for total 
inactivation of total coliform and E. coli. A 4-log reduction of phage MS2 was 
obtained after 2 minutes; 97.4 percent reduction was observed after 12 minutes. 
The authors also observed a higher inactivation of B. cereus spores in syringes 
placed in a ceramic container than of spores in syringes placed in a glass 
container. This finding could have some implications for the design of 
containers to be used in exposure of medical devices to microwave radiation. The 
article discusses the implications of these findings for consumer safety in the 
home environment.

A nonenzymatic proteomics strategy is applied to the rapid identification of 
viruses. The approach provides solubilization and subsequent digestion of viral 
coat proteins in under 30 s. Acid digestions were carried out using a 
laboratory-quality microwave system equipped with temperature, pressure, and 
power controls, which allowed for precise optimization of experimental 
parameters. Under optimal conditions, this method provides an efficient 
alternative to traditional enzymatic digestion-based methods for virus 
identification. Following rapid microwave heating of a suspension of a model 
virus, RNA bacteriophage MS2, 13 chemical digestion products were detected in 
parallel with the coat protein precursor using MALDI-TOF MS. Because of the high 
sequence coverage obtained, the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein was identified 
with high confidence and the specificity of the identification allowed for the 
discrimination between bacteriophage MS2 and other closely related RNA 
bacteriophages.

interacting with external sensitizer molecules may also be important, but this 
mechanism has not been conclusively demonstrated. To better understand the role 
of ROS, we investigated the inactivation of MS2 coliphage, a commonly used 
surrogate for human enteric viruses, in water samples irradiated with a solar 
simulator and containing different types of sensitizers: waste stabilization 
pond (WSP) constituents, Fluka humic acid (FHA), and Suwannee River humic acid 
(SRHA). Inactivation of MS2 by the indirect mechanism was significant for all 
three sensitizers, and the efficiency of the sensitizers at inactivating MS2 was 
FHA > SRHA > WSP. Both dissolved and particulate fractions in the WSP water 
contributed to inactivation. In the WSP water, the indirect process was 
quantitatively more importantthan direct damage by UVB light, due to the rapid 
attenuation of UVB compared to the longer wavelengths that may initiate the 
indirect mechanism. Singlet oxygen (1O2) was the most important ROS involved in 
the inactivation of MS2. The addition of histidine, a 1O2 quencher, decreased 
inactivation, whereas inactivation rate constants increased in solutions of D20. 
Selective quenchers for other ROS showed little or no protective effect. 
Inactivation in WSP water was a function of the steady-state 102 concentration 
and could be described by a second-order rate expression.

capsids.

BACKGROUND: Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is the most common type of acute 
leukemia in adults. Because conventional treatments are associated with 
substantial side effects, novel therapeutic strategies are required. Antisense 
oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) have shown promise as the basis of emerging 
therapies for fighting cancer, although in vivo application is hampered by high 
sensitivity to cellular nuclease degradation. Encapsidation of ODNs in a 
drug-delivery capsule would reduce such degradation, thereby increasing the 
potency of therapy. MS2 bacteriophage capsid proteins may be used as novel 
virus-like particles (VLPs) to deliver ODNs. Here we report an analysis of the 
uptake mechanism of this VLP system and preliminary examples of its use to 
deliver a number of ODNs, including some targeting p120 messenger RNAs, a 
biomarker overexpressed in myelogenous leukemia cells.
METHODS: The ODNs were synthesized as covalent extensions to the translational 
repressor/assembly initiation signal (TR), a 19 nt stem-loop, of the RNA phage 
MS2. The VLPs were constructed by soaking ODN-TR directly into recombinant 
RNA-free capsid shells. Targeting of the encapsidated ODNs into cells was 
achieved by a receptor-mediated endocytosis pathway identified by 
immunofluorescence microscopy or by transmission electron microscopy with 
gold-labeled antibodies.
RESULTS: After covalent decoration with transferrin on their surface, the VLPs 
containing ODNs demonstrated increased effectiveness in killing target leukemia 
cells expressing transferrin receptors, suggesting that this system is worthy of 
more extensive analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that RNA phage VLPs may be useful as a new 
nanomaterial for targeted delivery of antisense ODNs, or other macromolecular 
drug candidates.

The focus of coagulation as a water treatment process is shifting to accommodate 
recent regulatory additions that strive to balance the risks between microbial 
and chemical contamination of drinking water. In this work, enhanced coagulation 
using increased ferric chloride dose and/or pH adjustment was evaluated for 
removal efficacy of viruses on the United States Environmental Protection Agency 
(USEPA) Contaminant Candidate List (CCL), their surrogates, and dissolved 
organic carbon (DOC). Jar tests demonstrated that optimal DOC removal was 
achieved using 40 mg/L FeCl3 at a pH between 5 and 6. Under these conditions, 
bench-scale testing resulted in a maximum removal of 2.58 log units of 
adenovirus type 4, 2.50 log units of feline calicivirus, 2.32 log units of MS2, 
1.75 log units of PRD1, 1.52 log units of phi-X174, 2.49 log units of fr, and 
56% of DOC. The trend in virus removals (MS2 and fr > PRD1 and phi-X174) was 
consistent between bench- and pilot-scale testing; however, pilot-plant removals 
exceeded bench-scale removals. Feline calicivirus was more efficiently removed 
than the bacteriophages, thereby suggesting potential for the bacteriophages as 
suitable surrogates, with MS2 and fr being more representative and PRD1 and 
phi-X174 (which were removed to a lesser extent) more conservative. The 
bacteriophages do not appear to be appropriate surrogates for adenovirus.

Avenue, Laramie, Wyoming 82071, USA.

Desorption electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (DESI-MS) was evaluated for 
the detection of proteins ranging in molecular mass from 12 to 66 kDa. Proteins 
were uniformly deposited on a solid surface without pretreatment and analyzed 
with a DESI source coupled to a quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. DESI-MS 
parameters optimized for protein detection included solvent flow rate, 
temperature of heated capillary tube, incident and reflection angle, sheath gas 
pressure, and ESI voltage. Detection limits were obtained for all protein 
standards, and they were found to decrease with decreasing protein molecular 
mass: for cytochrome c (12.3 kDa) and lysozyme (14.3 kDa) a detection limit of 4 
ng/mm2 was obtained; for apomyoglobin (16.9 kDa) 20 ng/mm2; for 
beta-lactoglobulin B (18.2 kDa) 50 ng/mm2; and for chymotrypsinogen A (25.6 kDa) 
100 ng/mm2. The DESI-MS analysis of higher molecular mass proteins such as 
ovalbumin (44.4 kDa) and bovine serum albumin (66.4 kDa) yielded mass spectra of 
low signal-to-noise ratio, making their detection and molecular weight 
determination difficult. In this study, DESI-MS proved to be a rapid and robust 
method for accurate MW determination for proteins up to 17 kDa under ambient 
conditions. Finally, we demonstrated the DESI-MS detection of the bacteriophage 
MS2 capsid protein from crude samples with minimal sample preparation.

mRNA localization may be an important determinant for protein localization. We 
describe a simple PCR-based genomic-tagging strategy (m-TAG) that uses 
homologous recombination to insert binding sites for the RNA-binding MS2 coat 
protein (MS2-CP) between the coding region and 3' untranslated region (UTR) of 
any yeast gene. Upon coexpression of MS2-CP fused with GFP, we demonstrate the 
localization of endogenous mRNAs (ASH1, SRO7, PEX3 and OXA1) in living yeast 
(Saccharomyces cerevisiae).

Liming is a cost-effective treatment currently employed in many Class B 
biosolids production plants in the United States. A bench scale model of lime 
stabilization was designed to evaluate the persistence of viral, bacterial and 
parasitic pathogens. The survival of fecal coliforms, Salmonella, adenovirus 
type 5, rotavirus Wa, bacteriophage MS-2, Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts, 
Giardia lamblia cysts, and Ascaris lumbricoides ova was evaluated under lime 
stabilization conditions in a water matrix. Fecal coliforms and Salmonella were 
undetectable following 2 hours of lime stabilization, demonstrating a 7-log 
reduction. Adenovirus, MS-2 and rotavirus were below detectable levels following 
2 h of liming, demonstrating a 4-log reduction. G. lamblia cysts were also 
inactivated. A. lumbricoides ova remained viable following 72 hours of liming as 
did C. parvum oocysts. While this study confirmed that Ascaris ova are resistant 
to liming, their scarcity in sludge and low recovery efficiencies limit their 
use as indicator. The persistence of C. parvum oocysts after exposure to lime, 
suggests that this parasite would be a better choice as indicator for evaluating 
biosolids intended for land application. The studies done with adenovirus Type 
5, rotavirus Wa and male specific bacteriophage provided preliminary data 
demonstrating similar inactivation rates. Monitoring anthropogenic viruses is a 
time consuming, labor intensive and expensive process. If further studies could 
demonstrate that phage could be used as an indicator of other enteric viruses, 
enhanced monitoring could result in greater acceptance of land application of 
biosolids while demonstrating no increased public health threat.

The use of lime to reduce or eliminate pathogen content is a cost-effective 
treatment currently employed in many Class B biosolids production plants in the 
United States. A bench scale model of lime stabilization was designed to 
evaluate the survival of adenovirus type 5, rotavirus Wa, and the male specific 
bacteriophage, MS2, in various matrices. Each virus was initially evaluated 
independently in a reverse osmosis treated water matrix limed with an aqueous 
solution of calcium hydroxide for 24-hr at 22 +/- 5 degrees C. In all R/O water 
trials, adenovirus type 5, rotavirus Wa and MS2 were below detectable levels 
(<100.5 TCID50/mL and <1 PFU/mL respectively) following 0.1-hr of liming. 
Adenovirus type 5, rotavirus Wa, and MS2, were inoculated into composted, raw 
and previously limed matrices, representative of sludge and biosolids, to 
achieve a final concentration of approximately 104 PFU or TCID50/mL. Each matrix 
was limed for 24-hr at 22 +/- 5 degrees C and 4 +/- 2 degrees C. In all trials 
virus was below detectable levels following a 24-hr incubation. The time 
required for viral inactivation varied depending on the temperature and sample 
matrix. This research demonstrates reduction of adenovirus type 5, rotavirus Wa, 
and male-specific bacteriophage, in water, sludge and biosolids matrices 
following addition of an 8% calcium hydroxide slurry to achieve a pH of 12 for 
2-hr reduced to 11.5 for 22-hr by addition of 0.1 N HCl. In these trials, MS2 
was a conservative indicator of the efficacy of lime stabilization of adenovirus 
Type 5 and rotavirus Wa and therefore is proposed as a useful indicator 
organism.

Removal of particle-associated bacteriophages by dual-media filtration at 
different filter cycle stages and impacts on subsequent UV disinfection.

This bench-scale study investigated the passage of particle-associated 
bacteriophage through a dual-media (anthracite-sand) filter over a complete 
filter cycle and the effect on subsequent ultraviolet (UV) disinfection. Two 
model viruses, bacteriophages MS2 and T4, were considered. The water matrix was 
de-chlorinated tap water with either kaolin or Aldrich humic acid (AHA) added 
and coagulated with alum to form floc before filtration. The turbidity of the 
influent flocculated water was 6.4+/-1.5 NTU. Influent and filter effluent 
turbidity and particle counts were measured as well as headloss across the 
filter media. Filter effluent samples were collected for phage enumeration 
during three filter cycle stages: (i) filter ripening; (ii) stable operation; 
and (iii) end of filter cycle. Stable filter operation was defined according to 
a filter effluent turbidity goal of <0.3 NTU. Influent and filter effluent 
samples were subsequently exposed to UV light (254 nm) at 40 mJ/cm(2) using a 
low pressure UV collimated beam. The study found statistically significant 
differences (alpha=0.05) in the quantity of particle-associated phage present in 
the filter effluent during the three stages of filtration. There was reduced UV 
disinfection efficiency due to the presence of particle-associated phage in the 
filter effluent in trials with bacteriophage MS2 and humic acid floc. Unfiltered 
influent water samples also resulted in reduced UV inactivation of phage 
relative to particle-free control conditions for both phages. Trends in filter 
effluent turbidity corresponded with breakthrough of particle-associated phage 
in the filter effluent. The results therefore suggest that maintenance of 
optimum filtration conditions upstream of UV disinfection is a critical barrier 
to particle-associated viruses.

A simple, RNA-mediated allosteric switch controls the pathway to formation of a

Using mass spectrometry we have detected both assembly intermediates and the 
final product, the T=3 viral capsid, during reassembly of the RNA bacteriophage 
MS2. Assembly is only efficient when both types of quasiequivalent coat protein 
dimer seen in the final capsid are present in solution. NMR experiments confirm 
that interconversion of these conformers is allosterically regulated by 
sequence-specific binding of a short RNA stem-loop. Isotope pulse-chase 
experiments confirm that all intermediates observed are competent for further 
coat protein addition, i.e., they are all on the pathway to capsid formation, 
and that the unit of capsid growth is a coat protein dimer. The major 
intermediate species are dominated by stoichiometries derived from formation of 
the particle threefold axis, implying that there is a defined pathway toward the 
T=3 shell. These results provide the first experimental evidence for a detailed 
mechanistic explanation of the regulation of quasiequivalent capsid assembly. 
They suggest a direct role for the encapsidated RNA in assembly in vivo, which 
is consistent with the structure of the genomic RNA within wild-type phage.

Ultrafiltration (UF) is increasingly being recognized as a potentially effective 
procedure for concentrating and recovering microbes from large volumes of water 
and treated wastewater. Because of their very small pore sizes, UF membranes are 
capable of simultaneously concentrating viruses, bacteria, and parasites based 
on size exclusion. In this study, a UF-based water sampling procedure was used 
to simultaneously recover representatives of these three microbial classes 
seeded into 100-liter samples of tap water collected from eight cities covering 
six hydrologic areas of the United States. The UF-based procedure included 
hollow-fiber UF as the primary step for concentrating microbes and then used 
membrane filtration for bacterial culture assays, immunomagnetic separation for 
parasite recovery and quantification, and centrifugal UF for secondary 
concentration of viruses. Water samples were tested for nine water quality 
parameters to investigate whether water quality data correlated with measured 
recovery efficiencies and molecular detection levels. Average total method 
recovery efficiencies were 71, 97, 120, 110, and 91% for phiX174 bacteriophage, 
MS2 bacteriophage, Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium perfringens spores, and 
Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts, respectively. Real-time PCR and reverse 
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) for seeded microbes and controls indicated that tap 
water quality could affect the analytical performance of molecular amplification 
assays, although no specific water quality parameter was found to correlate with 
reduced PCR or RT-PCR performance.

Noroviruses (NVs) are the most frequent cause of outbreaks of gastroenteritis in 
common settings, with surface-mediated transfer via contact with fecally 
contaminated surfaces implicated in exposure. NVs are environmentally stable and 
persistent and have a low infectious dose. Several disinfectants have been 
evaluated for efficacy to control viruses on surfaces, but the toxicity and 
potential damage to treated materials limits their applicability. Sterilox 
hypochlorous acid (HOCl) solution (HAS) has shown broad-spectrum antimicrobial 
activity while being suitable for general use. The objectives of this study were 
to evaluate the efficacy of HAS to reduce NV both in aqueous suspensions and on 
inanimate carriers. HOCl was further tested as a fog to decontaminate large 
spaces. HOCl effectiveness was evaluated using nonculturable human NV measured 
by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and two surrogate viruses, coliphage MS2 
and murine NV, that were detected by both infectivity and RT-PCR. Exposing 
virus-contaminated carriers of ceramic tile (porous) and stainless steel 
(nonporous) to 20 to 200 ppm of HOCl solution resulted in > or = 99.9% (> or = 3 
log10) reductions of both infectivity and RNA titers of tested viruses within 10 
min of exposure time. HOCl fogged in a confined space reduced the infectivity 
and RNA titers of NV, murine NV, and MS2 on these carriers by at least 99.9% (3 
log10), regardless of carrier location and orientation. We conclude that HOCl 
solution as a liquid or fog is likely to be effective in disinfecting common 
settings to reduce NV exposures and thereby control virus spread via fomites.

Specific trans-acting proteins interact with auxiliary RNA polyadenylation 
elements in the COX-2 3'-UTR.

Two cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, COX-1 and COX-2, are present in human cells. 
While COX-1 is constitutively expressed, COX-2 is inducible and up-regulated in 
response to many signals. Since increased transcriptional activity accounts for 
only part of COX-2 up-regulation, we chose to explore other RNA processing 
mechanisms in the regulation of this gene. Previously, we showed that COX-2 is 
regulated by alternative polyadenylation, and that the COX-2 proximal 
polyadenylation signal contains auxiliary upstream sequence elements (USEs) that 
are very important in efficient polyadenylation. To explore trans-acting protein 
factors interacting with these cis-acting RNA elements, we performed pull-down 
assays with HeLa nuclear extract and biotinylated RNA oligonucleotides 
representing COX-2 USEs. We identified PSF, p54(nrb), PTB, and U1A as proteins 
specifically bound to the COX-2 USEs. We further explored their participation in 
polyadenylation using MS2 phage coat protein-MS2 RNA binding site tethering 
assays, and found that tethering any of these four proteins to the COX-2 USE 
mutant RNA can compensate for these cis-acting elements. Finally, we suggest 
that these proteins (p54(nrb), PTB, PSF, and U1A) may interact as a complex 
since immunoprecipitations of the transfected MS2 fusion proteins coprecipitate 
the other proteins.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the potential of an advanced oxidation 
process (AOP) for microbiocidal and virucidal inactivation. The viruses chosen 
for this study were bacteriophage MS2, T4, and T7. In addition, Bacillus 
subtilis spores and Escherichia coli were studied. By using H(2)O(2) in the 
presence of filtered ultraviolet (UV) irradiation (UV/H(2)O(2)) to generate 
wavelengths above 295nm, the direct UV photolysis disinfection mechanism was 
minimized, while disinfection by H(2)O(2) was also negligible. Virus T4 and E. 
coli in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) were sensitive to >295nm filtered UV 
irradiation (without H(2)O(2)), while MS2 was very resistant. Addition of 
H(2)O(2) at 25mg/l in the presence of filtered UV irradiation over a 15min 
reaction time did not result in any additional disinfection of virus T4, while 
an additional one log inactivation for T7 and 2.5 logs for MS2 were obtained. 
With E. coli, only a slight additional effect was observed when H(2)O(2) was 
added. B. subtilis spores did not show any inactivation at any of the conditions 
used in this study. The OH radical exposure (CT value) was calculated to present 
the relationship between the hydroxyl radical dose and microbial inactivation.

With the development of covalent modification strategies for viral capsids comes 
the ability to convert them into modular carrier systems for drug molecules and 
imaging agents. With this overall goal in mind, we have used two orthogonal 
modification strategies to decorate the exterior surface of genome-free MS2 
capsids with PEG chains, while installing 50-70 copies of a fluorescent dye 
inside as a drug cargo mimic. Despite the very high levels of modification, the 
capsids remained in the assembled state, as determined by TEM, size-exclusion 
chromatography, and dynamic light scattering analysis. The ability of the 
polymer coating to block the access of polyclonal antibodies to the capsid 
surface was probed using a sandwich ELISA, which indicated a 90% reduction in 
binding. Further experiments indicated that biotin groups placed at the distal 
ends of the polymer chains were still capable of binding to streptavidin, 
despite their proximity to the PEG layer. Finally, a modular strategy was 
developed for the attachment of small-molecule targeting groups to the polymer 
chains through an efficient oxime formation reaction. As a result of these 
studies, a robust and versatile new platform has emerged for the potential 
delivery of therapeutic cargo.

BACKGROUND: Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR for norovirus detection is prone to 
false-negative results due to inhibitory substances in faeces. An internal 
control is needed to monitor extraction efficiency and to detect inhibition.
OBJECTIVES: To further develop a one-step RT-PCR assay for norovirus 
detection/genogrouping by addition of MS2 bacteriophage as an internal control.
STUDY DESIGN: Our norovirus RT-PCR assay was modified by addition of MS2 phage 
to the extraction tray and primers/probe for MS2 detection to the reaction mix. 
The effect of addition of MS2 phage and MS2 primers/probe on the 
sensitivity/specificity of the PCR assay was examined.
RESULTS: The addition of MS2 as an internal control showed no loss of 
sensitivity or specificity for norovirus detection.
CONCLUSIONS: A triplex, one-step, type-specific, real-time RT-PCR with MS2 
internal control has been developed for use in routine laboratory diagnosis of 
norovirus infection.

Diarrhoea and other diseases associated with unsafe drinking water are a leading 
cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide and in India. Household-based water 
treatment has been shown to be an effective means of reducing this disease 
burden. Numerous such devices are manufactured and sold all over the world. We 
tested the microbiological performance of a leading brand of each of three 
common types of water treatment devices designed for household use in India: a 
ceramic candle gravity filter, an iodine resin gravity filter and an iodine 
resin faucet mounted filter. The ceramic candle filter and the iodine resin 
faucet filter reduced bacteria by more than 4 logs. However, the reduction of 
the MS2 phage (surrogate for viruses) and 3 micron microspheres (surrogate for 
protozoan cysts) in these devices was lower than log 3.4 and log 2.6, 
respectively. There were also high levels of residual iodide (and in some cases, 
iodine) in treated water from the iodine-based devices. While household water 
treatment could play an important role in India, standards are necessary so that 
consumers can ensure that the devices they purchase and use in the home are 
effective and safe.

CZE and CIEF were so far applied to the analysis of tobacco mosaic virus, 
Semliki forest virus, human rhinovirus, adenovirus, norovirus and the 
bacteriophages T5 and MS2. The concentration of viral or subviral particles, of 
capsid proteins and viral genomes were determined, their electrophoretic 
mobilities and pI values were measured and bioaffinity reactions between viruses 
and antibodies, antibody fragments and receptor fragments were assessed. The 
role of detergents added to the BGE to obtain reproducible electrophoretic 
conditions was elucidated. The analytes were detected via their UV-absorbance or 
via fluorescence after derivatization of the viral capsid, the nucleic acid, or 
both. A new dimension to the detection is added by the possibility of making use 
of the viral infectivity. At least in theory, this allows for the unequivocal 
identification of a single infectious virus particle after collection at the 
capillary outlet. This review summarizes the 25 papers so far published on this 
topic.

Magnetic resonance contrast agents from viral capsid shells: a comparison of 
exterior and interior cargo strategies.

94720-1460, USA.

Two high-relaxivity nanoscale magnetic resonance contrast agents have been built 
using bacteriophage MS2 as a biomolecular scaffold. Protein capsid shells were 
functionalized on either the exterior or interior surface to display multiple 
copies of an aldehyde functional group. Subsequently, approximately 90 
heteropodal bis(hydroxypyridonate)terephthalamide ligands were attached to these 
sites through oxime condensation reactions. Upon complexation with Gd3+, 
contrast agents with ionic relaxivities of up to 41.6 mM-1 s-1 (30 MHz, 25 
degrees C) and total molecular relaxivities of up to 3900 mM-1 s-1 (30 MHz, 25 
degrees C) were produced. Capsids sequestering the Gd-chelates on the interior 
surface (attached through tyrosine residues) not only provided higher 
relaxivities than their exterior functionalized counterparts (which relied on 
lysine modification) but also exhibited improved water solubility and capsid 
stability. The attachment functional cargo to the interior surface is envisioned 
to minimize its influences on biodistribution, yielding significant advantages 
for tissue targeting by additional groups attached to the capsid exterior.

The aim of this study was to investigate some aspects of the performance of 
electrochemical process as an alternative disinfection strategy, while 
minimising DBPs, for water purification. The study of electrochemical processes 
has shown free chlorine to be produced, but smaller amounts of stronger 
oxidants, such as ozone, hydrogen peroxide and OH radicals (*OH), were also 
generated. The formation of mixed oxidants increased with increasing electric 
conductivity, but was limited at conductivities greater than 0.6 mS/cm. Using 
several microorganisms, such as E. coli and MS2 bacteriophage, inactivation 
kinetic studies were performed. With the exception of free chlorine, the role of 
mixed oxidants, especially OH radicals, was investigated for enhancement of the 
inactivation rate. Additionally, the formation and reduction of DBPs was studied 
by monitoring the concentration of haloacetic acids (HAAs) during the process.

UV-A and visible light irradiation.

Silver ions have been widely used as an effective water disinfectant or 
antimicrobial material for many decades. In addition, the application of silver 
ions in combination with other biocides, especially UV(254) (UV-C) irradiation, 
was reported to be effective in enhancing its germicidal activity. However, it 
is not yet known how UV-A (300-400 nm) or visible light irradiation, which have 
little or no antimicrobial activities, affect microorganism inactivation by 
silver ions. This study newly reports that the inactivation efficiencies of 
Escherichia coli and MS-2 phage by silver ions were significantly enhanced by 
UV-A or visible light irradiation. UV-A irradiation enhanced the inactivation of 
E. coli and MS-2 phage by 3.0 and 2.5 log/30 min, respectively, as compared with 
the simple summated value of individual applications of silver ions and UV-A. A 
similar trend was observed with visible light irradiation (>400 nm) although the 
level of enhancement was lessened. The photochemical reaction of silver-cysteine 
complex was suggested as a possible mechanism for this enhancement. 
Spectrophotometric and MALDI-TOF mass analyses support the fact that silver ions 
coupled with light irradiation causes critical cell damage through the 
complexation of silver ions with thiol (-SH) groups in structural or enzymatic 
proteins of the microorganisms and their subsequent photochemical destruction.

Association with natural organic matter enhances the sunlight-mediated 
inactivation of MS2 coliphage by singlet oxygen.

MS2 coliphage, a surrogate for human enteric viruses, is inactivated by singlet 
oxygen (1O2) produced via sunlight-mediated excitation of natural organic matter 
(NOM) in surface waters. The 1O2 concentration within a NOM macromolecule or 
supramolecular assembly ([1O2]internal) is orders of magnitude higher than in 
the bulk solution ([1O2]bulk). In close proximity of NOM, MS2 is thus exposed to 
an elevated 1O2 concentration ([1O2]NOM), and inactivation is likely to be 
enhanced as compared to the bulk solution. In experiments using a solar 
simulator, we determined [1O2]bulk, [1O2]internal, as well as the association of 
MS2 with four NOMs (Fluka humic acid, FHA; Suwannee river humic acid, SRHA; 
Aldrich humic acid, AHA; Pony lake fulvic acid, PLFA), and studied their effect 
on the MS2 inactivation rate constant, k(obs), over a range of 1-25 mg NOM/L. 
The k(obs) values were modeled as the sum of the inactivation rate constants in 
close proximity to the NOM and in the bulk solution, assuming Langmuir-type 
adsorption of NOM onto MS2. FHA and SRHA exhibited 13-22 fold greater adsorption 
equilibrium constants than AHA and PLFA. Inactivation in the bulk solution 
contributed between 2% (20 mg/L FHA) and 39% (5 mg/L AHA) toward the overall 
k(obs). Thus, even for the less adsorbing NOM, inactivation was dominated by 
[1O2]NOM rather than [1O2]bulk. Changes in solution chemistry to promote closer 
interactions between MS2 and NOM also enhanced k(obs). Addition of Mg2+ to 
neutralize the negative surface charge of MS2 and NOM increased k(obs) up to 
4.1-fold. Similarly, lowering the solution pH closer to the isoelectric point of 
MS2 (pl = 3.9) enhanced k(ob), 51-fold in 5 mg/L AHA.

Discrimination of bacteria and bacteriophages by Raman spectroscopy and 
surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy.

Goeller LJ(1), Riley MR.

Author information:

USA.

Detection of pathogenic organisms in the environment presents several challenges 
due to the high cost and long times typically required for identification and 
quantification. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based methods are often hindered 
by the presence of polymerase inhibiting compounds and so direct methods of 
quantification that do not require enrichment or amplification are being sought. 
This work presents an analysis of pathogen detection using Raman spectroscopy to 
identify and quantify microorganisms without drying. Confocal Raman measurements 
of the bacterium Escherichia coli and of two bacteriophages, MS2 and PRD1, were 
analyzed for characteristic peaks and to estimate detection limits using 
traditional Raman and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). MS2, PRD1, and 
E. coli produced differentiable Raman spectra with approximate detection limits 
for PRD1 and E. coli of 10(9) pfu/mL and 10(6) cells/mL, respectively. These 
high detection concentration limits are partly due to the small sampling volume 
of the confocal system but translate to quantification of as little as 100 
bacteriophages to generate a reliable spectral signal. SERS increased signal 
intensity 10(3) fold and presented peaks that were visible using 2-second 
acquisitions; however, peak locations and intensities were variable, as typical 
with SERS. These results demonstrate that Raman spectroscopy and SERS have 
potential as a pathogen monitoring platform.

College Park, MD 20742, USA. amrossi@umd.edu

There is a growing need for virus sensors with improved sensitivity and dynamic 
range, for applications including disease diagnosis, pharmaceutical research, 
agriculture and homeland security. We report here a new method for improving the 
sensitivity for detection of the bacteriophage virus MS2 using thin films of 
nanoporous silicon. Porous silicon is an easily fabricated material that has 
extremely high surface area to volume ratio, making it an ideal platform for 
surface based sensors. We have developed and evaluated two different methods for 
covalent bioconjugation of antibodies inside of porous silicon films, and we 
show that the pore penetration and binding efficiency depend on the wettability 
of the porous surface. The resulting films were used to selectively capture 
dye-labeled MS2 viruses from solution, and a viral concentration as low as 2 x 
10(7) plaque-forming units per mL (pfu/mL) was detectable by measuring the 
fluorescence from the exposed porous silicon film. The system exhibits 
sensitivity and dynamic range similar to the Luminex liquid array-based assay 
while outperforming protein micro-array methods.

Effect of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation on viral aerosols.

Walker CM(1), Ko G.

Author information:
(1)University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.

Ultraviolet (UV) germicidal air disinfection is an engineering method used to 
control the airborne transmission of pathogenic microorganisms in high-risk 
settings. Despite the recent emergence of respiratory viral pathogens such as 
SARS and avian influenza viruses, UV disinfection of pathogenic viral aerosols 
has not been examined. Hence, we characterized the UV disinfection of viral 
aerosols using the bacteriophage MS2, adenovirus, and coronavirus. Our 
objectives were to characterize the effect of nebulization and air sampling on 
the survival of important viral pathogens, quantitatively characterize and 
estimate the UV susceptibility of pathogenic viral aerosols, and evaluate the 
effect of relative humidity (RH) on the susceptibility of viral aerosols, to 254 
nm UV-C. The viruses were aerosolized into an experimental chamber using a 
six-jet Collison nebulizer, exposed to 254 nm UV, and sampled using an AGI-30 
liquid impinger. Both the MS2 and adenovirus aerosols were very resistant to UV 
air disinfection, with a reduction of less than 1 logarithm in viable viral 
aerosols at a UV dose of 2608 microW s/cm2. The susceptibility of coronavirus 
aerosols was 7-10 times that of the MS2 and adenovirus aerosols. Unlike 
bacterial aerosols, there was no significant protective effect of high RH on UV 
susceptibility of the tested viral aerosols. We confirmed that the UV 
disinfection rate differs greatly between viral aerosols and viruses suspended 
in liquid.

Dyed microspheres have been developed as a new method for validation of 
ultraviolet (UV) reactor systems. When properly applied, dyed microspheres allow 
measurement of the UV dose distribution delivered by a photochemical reactor for 
a given operating condition. Prior to this research, dyed microspheres had only 
been applied to a bench-scale UV reactor. The goal of this research was to 
extend the application of dyed microspheres to large-scale reactors. Dyed 
microsphere tests were conducted on two prototype large-scale UV reactors at the 
UV Validation and Research Center of New York (UV Center) in Johnstown, NY. All 
microsphere tests were conducted under conditions that had been used previously 
in biodosimetry experiments involving two challenge bacteriophage: MS2 and 
Qbeta. Numerical simulations based on computational fluid dynamics and 
irradiance field modeling were also performed for the same set of operating 
conditions used in the microspheres assays. Microsphere tests on the first 
reactor illustrated difficulties in sample collection and discrimination of 
microspheres against ambient particles. Changes in sample collection and work-up 
were implemented in tests conducted on the second reactor that allowed for 
improvements in microsphere capture and discrimination against the background. 
Under these conditions, estimates of the UV dose distribution from the 
microspheres assay were consistent with numerical simulations and the results of 
biodosimetry, using both challenge organisms. The combined application of dyed 
microspheres, biodosimetry, and numerical simulation offers the potential to 
provide a more in-depth description of reactor performance than any of these 
methods individually, or in combination. This approach also has the potential to 
substantially reduce uncertainties in reactor validation, thereby leading to 
better understanding of reactor performance, improvements in reactor design, and 
decreases in reactor capital and operating costs.

An isothermal batch experiment was conducted in the laboratory to compare 
adsorption of bacteriophages MS2 and phiX174 onto 6 different soils (red loam 
soil, red clay soil, wushan soil, huangni soil, sandy fluvo-aquic soil and loamy 
fluvo-aquic soil) in China. Soils with sterilized or non-sterilized treatment 
were used. Relative coefficients of each numerical simulation of the isotherms 
using three models were evaluated. The results show that the properties of the 
soil and virus, and presence/absence of the soil autochthonous microorganisms 
have pronounced effect on the virus adsorption. Both MS2 and phiX174 are almost 
completely adsorbed by the red clay soil, but minimal adsorption is observed in 
the two fluvo-aquic soils. Adsorption of phiX174 to all the non-sterilized soils 
is generally much greater than that of MS2, while sterilization leads to 
opposite results. Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms are found to have better 
coefficients to simulate the apparent steady-state virus concentrations. 
Freundlich isotherm is capable of demonstrating the effect of virus 
concentration on adsorption behavior. Langmuir isotherms can be used to compare 
relative adsorption among treatments, while the present study suggests that 
maximum adsorption can not be calculated when using the Langmuir isotherms.

Inactivation of bacteriophages via photosensitization of fullerol nanoparticles.

Houston, Texas 77204-4003, USA.

The production of two reactive oxygen species through UV photosensitization of 
polyhydroxylated fullerene (fullerol) is shown to enhance viral inactivation 
rates. The production of both singlet oxygen and superoxide by fullerol in the 
presence of UV light is confirmed via two unique methods: electron paramagnetic 
resonance and reduction of nitro blue tetrazolium. These findings build on 
previous results both in the area of fullerene photosensitization and in the 
area of fullerene impact on microfauna. Results showed thatthe first-order MS2 
bacteriophage inactivation rate nearly doubled due to the presence of singlet 
oxygen and increased by 125% due to singlet oxygen and superoxide as compared to 
UVA illumination alone. When fullerol and NADH are present in solution, dark 
inactivation of viruses occurs at nearly the same rate as that produced by UVA 
illumination without nanoparticles. These results suggest a potential for 
fullerenes to impact virus populations in both natural and engineered systems 
ranging from surface waters to disinfection technologies for water and 
wastewater treatment.

AIM: The aim of this study was to determine whether aggregation processes in 
aqueous phase may explain the decrease in plaque forming unit (PFU) counts for 
pH close to the isoelectric point (pI) of viral particles (MS2 phages).
METHODS AND RESULTS: Loss in PFU was observed for pH < or = pI (pI(MS2) = 3.9): 
for example, at pH 2.5, loss was approx. 3 log(10) PFU. Particle size analysis 
combining results of dynamic light scattering and flow particle image analysis 
was then applied to determine the aggregate state of viral suspensions by 
recording size distributions. The size of major population significantly changed 
to 30 nm at neutral pH to more than several micrometres when passing below the 
isoelectric point.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that MS2 phages exhibit significant aggregation 
processes for pH < or = pI leading to aggregate with sizes of few micrometres. 
This aggregation process can largely explain the decline in PFU counts.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: It is clear that viral aggregation can be 
a source of significant bias for PFU assays because in the presence of an 
aggregate the PFU count can be less than the sum of its constituent particles. 
Therefore, cautions should be taken in terms of conditions of storage (pH far 
from pI) to avoid such aggregation artefact.

The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of modifying commercial 
microporous ceramic bacteria filters to promote adsorption of viruses. The 
internal surface of the filter medium was coated with ZrO(2) nanopowder via 
dip-coating and heat-treatment in order to impart a filter surface charge 
opposite to that of the target viruses. Streaming potential measurements 
revealed a shift in the isoelectric point from pH <3 to between pH 5.5 and 9, 
respectively. While the base filter elements generally exhibited only 75% 
retention with respect to MS2 bacteriophages, the modified elements achieved a 
7log removal (99.99999%) of these virus-like particles. The coating process also 
increased the specific surface area of the filters from approximately 2m(2)/g to 
between 12.5 and 25.5m(2)/g, thereby also potentially increasing their 
adsorption capacity. The results demonstrate that, given more development 
effort, the chosen manufacturing process has the potential to yield effective 
virus filters with throughputs superior to those of current virus filtration 
techniques.

We describe a point-of-use (POU) ultraviolet (UV) disinfection technology, the 
UV Tube, which can be made with locally available resources around the world for 
under $50 US. Laboratory and field studies were conducted to characterize the UV 
Tube's performance when treating a flowrate of 5 L/min. Based on biological 
assays with MS2 coliphage, the UV Tube delivered an average fluence of 900+/-80 
J/m(2) (95% CI) in water with an absorption coefficient of 0.01 cm(-1). The 
residence time distribution in the UV Tube was characterized as plug flow with 
dispersion (Peclet Number = 19.7) and a mean hydraulic residence time of 36 s. 
Undesirable compounds were leached or produced from UV Tubes constructed with 
unlined ABS, PVC, or a galvanized steel liner. Lining the PVC pipe with 
stainless steel, however, prevented production of regulated halogenated 
organics. A small field study in two rural communities in Baja California Sur 
demonstrated that the UV Tube reduced E. coli concentrations to less than 1/100 
ml in 65 out of 70 samples. Based on these results, we conclude that the UV Tube 
is a promising technology for treating household drinking water at the point of 
use.

Laboratory column experiments were conducted to study the effects of anionic 
polyacrylamide (PAM) polymer and surfactant linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) 
on the movement of Escherichia coli and the FRNA phage MS-2. The study was 
designed to evaluate if PAM or PAM + LAS would enhance the mobility of human 
pathogens in tropical soils under unsaturated conditions. No breakthrough of 
phage was observed in a 10 cm column after passing 100 pore volumes of solution 
containing 1x10(8) plaque-forming units (PFU)/ml. In later experiments, after 
passing 10-20 pore volumes of influent containing 1x10(8)/ml MS-2 or E. coli 
through 15 cm columns, the soil was sliced and the organisms eluted. Phage moved 
slightly deeper in the polymer-treated column than in the control column. There 
was no measurable difference in the movement of E. coli in either 
polymer-treated or control columns. The properties of the soil (high amounts of 
metal oxides, kaolinitic clay), unsaturated flow conditions, and relatively high 
ionic strengths of the leaching solution attributed to significant retention of 
these indicators. The impacts of PAM and LAS on the mobility of E. coli or MS-2 
phage in the chosen soils were not significant.

Virus-like particles (VLP) have received considerable attention for vaccine, 
drug delivery, gene therapy and material science applications. Although the 
number of unique VLP and their applications are rapidly growing, the positive 
impact of VLP applications is limited by the current diverse, expensive, and 
typically low-yielding production technologies available. These technologies, 
when scaled, often result in structurally and compositionally inconsistent 
products. We present Escherichia coli-based cell-free protein synthesis as a 
production technology to overcome many of the limitations of current VLP 
production processes. Using this technique, the MS2 bacteriophage coat protein 
VLP was produced at a yield 14 times the best published production yield. Also, 
a C-terminally truncated Hepatitis B core protein VLP was produced at similarly 
high yields (6 x 10(13) VLP/mL). These VLP were found to have comparable 
characteristics to those produced in vivo. The scalability of this technology 
was tested without loss in production yields. To our knowledge, this is the 
first time a prokaryote-based in vitro transcription/translation system has 
generated a virus-like particle.

The prevalence of pathogenic microorganisms in seawater can result in waterborne 
and food borne outbreaks. This study was performed to determine the effect of 
sunlight and salinity on the die-off of Cryptosporidium parvum. Cryptosporidium 
parvum oocysts, Escherichia coli, and MS2 coliphage were seeded into tap water 
and seawater samples and then exposed to sunlight. The die-off of C. parvum in 
seawater, as measured by infectivity, was greater under sunlight (-3.08 log10) 
than under dark conditions (-1.31 log10). While, no significant difference was 
recorded in the die-off of C. parvum, under dark conditions, in tap water as 
compared to seawater (P < 0.05), indicating that the synergistic effect of 
salinity and sunlight was responsible for the enhanced die-off in seawater. The 
die-off of MS2 coliphage and E. coli was greater than that observed for C. 
parvum under all tested conditions. This indicates that these microorganisms 
cannot serve as indicators for the presence of C. parvum oocysts in seawaters. 
The results of the study suggest that C. parvum can persist as infectious 
oocysts for a long time in seawater and can thus pose a serious hazard by direct 
and indirect contact with humans.

stabilization of human biosolids.

AIM: To compare the inactivation rates of male-specific bacteriophage-2 (MS2), 
hepatitis A HM-175/18f (HM-175) and reovirus T1 Lang (T1 L) during alkaline 
stabilization of wastewater residues.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A bench scale alkaline stabilization model was used to 
evaluate the inactivation of MS2 seeded into raw sludge simultaneously with 
HM-175 or T1 L. Stabilization was performed in triplicate at 28 and 4 degrees C 
for both viral combinations. During stabilization at 28 and 4 degrees C, MS2 and 
T1 L concentrations were similar at each time point (t = 0.1, 2, 12 and 24 h). 
MS2 and HM-175 concentrations were also similar at each time point during 
stabilization at 28 degrees C. At 4 degrees C, MS2 and HM-175 concentrations 
were not similar at the first two time points (t = 0.1 and 2 h), but were 
similar at later time points (t = 12 and 24 h).
CONCLUSIONS: The inactivation rates of T1 L at 4 degrees C and both T1 L and 
HM-175 at 28 degrees C were similar to the inactivation rate of MS2 at all time 
points. At 4 degrees C, MS2 was inactivated at a faster rate during the first 
two time points (t = 0.1 and 2 h) than HM-175, but was inactivated similarly at 
later time points (t = 12 and 24 h).
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Phages, such as MS2, would be ideal 
indicators for the presence of enteric viruses in wastewater residues because of 
their ubiquity, nonpathogenic nature, low cost and time associated with their 
detection. The findings of this study suggest that MS2 could serve as an 
indicator for monitoring the persistence of enteric viruses, such as HM-175 and 
T1 L, during alkaline stabilization performed at moderate temperatures (28 
degrees C), but may not serve as an indicator for HM-175 at reduced temperature 
(4 degrees C). The utility of MS2 as an indicator of viral persistence during 
biosolids treatment should be further evaluated, as the increased efficiency and 
frequency of pathogen monitoring associated with their use may reduce the 
potential public health risk associated with biosolids, facilitating a greater 
acceptance for their land application.

AIMS: To compare the disinfection ability of two widely used electrolytic 
generation systems (ClorTec and MIOX) and the conventional chlorine disinfectant 
(sodium hypochlorite) using three strains of Bacillus subtilis spores and MS2 
bacteriophage.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Three B. subtilis aerobic spore strains (ATCC1A1, 35021 and 
35946) and the bacteriophage MS2 (ATCC 15597-B1) were propagated and sporulated. 
Four indicator organisms were exposed to four disinfectant treatments for 
comparing the effectiveness of inactivation: hypochlorite, ClorTec, MIOX and 
MIOX-anode. The results indicated that the two electrolytic generation systems 
were as effective as the conventional chlorination for the inactivation of 
micro-organisms used. Some data points showed the variation using anova 
analysis, in which the inactivation of MIOX and ClorTec was higher than that of 
hypochlorite.
CONCLUSIONS: The ClorTec and MIOX systems are quite similar to hypochlorite in 
the inactivation-effectiveness for aerobic spores and bacteriophage in drinking 
water.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Laboratory-scale investigation proved that 
gaseous chlorine could be replaced by either ClorTec or MIOX systems for the 
drinking water treatment utilities, which still could maintain the same 
disinfection efficiency.

The three-dimensional structure of genomic RNA in bacteriophage MS2: 
implications for assembly.

Toropova K(1), Basnak G, Twarock R, Stockley PG, Ranson NA.

Author information:
(1)Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology, University of Leeds, Leeds, 
LS2 9JT, UK.

Using cryo-electron microscopy, single particle image processing and 
three-dimensional reconstruction with icosahedral averaging, we have determined 
the three-dimensional solution structure of bacteriophage MS2 capsids 
reassembled from recombinant protein in the presence of short oligonucleotides. 
We have also significantly extended the resolution of the previously reported 
structure of the wild-type MS2 virion. The structures of recombinant MS2 capsids 
reveal clear density for bound RNA beneath the coat protein binding sites on the 
inner surface of the T=3 MS2 capsid, and show that a short extension of the 
minimal assembly initiation sequence that promotes an increase in the efficiency 
of assembly, interacts with the protein capsid forming a network of bound RNA. 
The structure of the wild-type MS2 virion at approximately 9 A resolution 
reveals icosahedrally ordered density encompassing approximately 90% of the 
single-stranded RNA genome. The genome in the wild-type virion is arranged as 
two concentric shells of density, connected along the 5-fold symmetry axes of 
the particle. This novel RNA fold provides new constraints for models of viral 
assembly.

Evaluation of murine norovirus, feline calicivirus, poliovirus, and MS2 as 
surrogates for human norovirus in a model of viral persistence in surface water 
and groundwater.

Health Sciences, 615 N. Wolfe St., Room E6620, Baltimore, MD 21205-2103, USA.

Human noroviruses (NoVs) are a significant cause of nonbacterial gastroenteritis 
worldwide, with contaminated drinking water a potential transmission route. The 
absence of a cell culture infectivity model for NoV necessitates the use of 
molecular methods and/or viral surrogate models amenable to cell culture to 
predict NoV inactivation. The NoV surrogates murine NoV (MNV), feline 
calicivirus (FCV), poliovirus (PV), and male-specific coliphage MS2, in 
conjunction with Norwalk virus (NV), were spiked into surface water samples (n = 
9) and groundwater samples (n = 6). Viral persistence was monitored at 25 
degrees C and 4 degrees C by periodically analyzing virus infectivity (for all 
surrogate viruses) and nucleic acid (NA) for all tested viruses. FCV infectivity 
reduction rates were significantly higher than those of the other surrogate 
viruses. Infectivity reduction rates were significantly higher than NA reduction 
rates at 25 degrees C (0.18 and 0.09 log(10)/day for FCV, 0.13 and 0.10 
log(10)/day for PV, 0.12 and 0.06 log(10)/day for MS2, and 0.09 and 0.05 
log(10)/day for MNV) but not significant at 4 degrees C. According to a multiple 
linear regression model, the NV NA reduction rates (0.04 +/- 0.01 log(10)/day) 
were not significantly different from the NA reduction rates of MS2 (0.05 +/- 
0.03 log(10)/day) and MNV (0.04 +/- 0.03 log(10)/day) and were significantly 
different from those of FCV (0.08 +/- 0.03 log(10)/day) and PV (0.09 +/- 0.03 
log(10)/day) at 25 degrees C. In conclusion, MNV shows great promise as a human 
NoV surrogate due to its genetic similarity and environmental stability. FCV was 
much less stable and thus questionable as an adequate surrogate for human NoVs 
in surface water and groundwater.

The cocrystal structure of the PP7 bacteriophage coat protein in complex with 
its translational operator identifies a distinct mode of sequence-specific RNA 
recognition when compared to the well-characterized MS2 coat protein-RNA 
complex. The structure reveals the molecular basis of the PP7 coat protein's 
ability to selectively bind its cognate RNA, and it demonstrates that the 
conserved beta-sheet surface is a flexible architecture that can evolve to 
recognize diverse RNA hairpins.

Montréal, Québec H3C 3J7, Canada.

This chapter presents the MS2-GFP system, a method to study the trafficking of 
RNA molecules in living cells. This system is based on two components: a fusion 
of the MS2 coat protein to a fluorescent protein and a reporter mRNA containing 
multimers of the RNA stem-loop recognized by the MS2 coat protein. The MS2-GFP 
protein bound to the RNA stem-loops acts as a beacon that allows the detection 
of this mRNA within a cell by epifluorescence or confocal microscopy. This 
chapter focuses on the use of this system in mammalian fibroblast cells and in 
yeast cells, and discusses several technical considerations of the MS2-GFP 
system. Detailed protocols for validating the MS2-GFP signal in fixed cells by 
fluorescent in situ hybridization of the target RNA using fluorophore-labeled 
oligonucleotide probes are also provided.

This study was conducted to evaluate the removal of adenovirus, feline 
calicivirus (FCV), and bacteriophages MS-2, fr, PRD-1, and Phi X-174 during 
conventional drinking water treatment using ferric chloride as a coagulant. 
Adenovirus and FCV were removed to a greater extent than PRD-1 and Phi X-174, 
indicating that these bacteriophages may be appropriate surrogates for both 
adenovirus and FCV. Of the four bacteriophages studied in the pilot plant, MS-2 
was removed to the greatest extent (5.1 log), followed by fr (4.9 log), PRD-1 
(3.5 log), and Phi X-174 (1.3 log). The virus removal trend in the pilot-scale 
testing was similar to the bench-scale testing; however, the bench-scale testing 
seemed to provide a conservative estimate of the pilot plant performance. In the 
pilot-scale testing, MS-2 and fr were removed with the greatest efficiency 
during filtration, whereas PRD-1 and Phi X-174 showed the greatest removal 
during sedimentation.

Impact of chemical and structural anisotropy on the electrophoretic mobility of 
spherical soft multilayer particles: the case of bacteriophage MS2.

Langlet J(1), Gaboriaud F, Gantzer C, Duval JF.

Nancy-University, CNRS, France.

We report a theoretical investigation of the electrohydrodynamic properties of 
spherical soft particles composed of permeable concentric layers that differ in 
thickness, soft material density, chemical composition, and flow penetration 
degree. Starting from a recent numerical scheme developed for the computation of 
the direct-current electrophoretic mobility (mu) of diffuse soft bioparticles, 
the dependence of mu on the electrolyte concentration and solution pH is 
evaluated taking the known three-layered structure of bacteriophage MS2 as a 
supporting model system (bulk RNA, RNA-protein bound layer, and coat protein). 
The electrokinetic results are discussed for various layer thicknesses, 
hydrodynamic flow penetration degrees, and chemical compositions, and are 
discussed on the basis of the equilibrium electrostatic potential and 
hydrodynamic flow field profiles that develop within and around the structured 
particle. This study allows for identifying the cases where the electrophoretic 
mobility is a function of the inner structural and chemical specificity of the 
particle and not only of its outer surface properties. Along these lines, we 
demonstrate the general inapplicability of the notions of zeta potential (zeta) 
and surface charge for quantitatively interpreting electrokinetic data collected 
for such systems. We further shed some light on the physical meaning of the 
isoelectric point. In particular, numerical and analytical simulations performed 
on structured soft layers in indifferent electrolytic solution demonstrate that 
the isoelectric point is a complex ionic strength-dependent signature of the 
flow permeation properties and of the chemical and structural details of the 
particle. Finally, the electrophoretic mobilities of the MS2 virus measured at 
various ionic strength levels and pH values are interpreted on the basis of the 
theoretical formalism aforementioned. It is shown that the electrokinetic 
features of MS2 are to a large extent determined not only by the external 
proteic capsid but also by the chemical composition and hydrodynamic flow 
permeation of/within the inner RNA-protein bound layer and bulk RNA part of the 
bacteriophage. The impact of virus aggregation, as revealed by decreasing 
diffusion coefficients for decreasing pH values, is also discussed.

Many steps in the control of gene expression are dependent on RNA-binding 
proteins, most of which are bi-functional, in as much as they both bind to RNA 
and interact with other protein partners in a functional complex. A powerful 
approach to study the functional properties of these proteins in vivo, 
independently of their RNA-binding ability, is to attach or tether them to 
specifically engineered reporter mRNAs whose fate can be easily followed. Two 
tethering systems have been mainly used in eukaryotic cells, namely the MS2 coat 
protein system and the lambda N-B box system. In this review, we firstly 
describe several studies in which these tethering systems have been used and 
provide an overview of these applications. We next describe the major features 
of these two systems, and, finally, we highlight a number of points that should 
be considered when designing experiments using this approach.

The effect of wetland vegetation on the survival of Escherichia coli, Salmonella

A study was conducted to examine the role of aquatic plants used in constructed 
wetlands on the survival of enteric bacteria and viruses. Four small-scale 
wetland systems, receiving fresh water and two other wetland systems, receiving 
secondary unchlorinated sewage were used in this study. Fresh water and 
secondary sewage without the presence of any aquatic plants were used as 
controls. Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, bacteriophage MS-2 and 
poliovirus were added to the waters collected from the wetlands and controls. 
The presence of aquatic plants significantly increased the die-off of both 
bacteria in fresh water and secondary sewage. No significant difference in the 
die-off of E. coli and S. typhimurium was observed in water from wetlands with 
different types of plants in freshwater. However, there was a significant 
difference in the die-off of E. coli in water with aquatic plants when sewage 
was used. The presence of the plants significantly increased the inactivation of 
MS-2 and poliovirus. Additional work on the survival of E. coli indicated that 
the plausible mechanism of bacterial die-off in constructed wetlands is through 
increased microbial competition or predation.

Treated effluent can be reused for the irrigation of parks and sports grounds 
but there is an associated potential public health risks from microbial 
pathogens present on the grass surface, particularly when used for contact 
sports. The main aim of this study was to investigate the survival of pathogenic 
and indicator microorganisms on the grass surface of a sports ground irrigated 
with treated effluent under differing climatic conditions. Results showed that 
Salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus 
faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus decayed faster under direct sunlight than MS2 
with one log(10) reduction (T(90)) varying from 3 to 11 hours. Rapid decay 
(T(90) 3 to 4 hours) of bacterial pathogens occurred in both sunlight and shade 
during the summer. In contrast, T(90) times for the bacteria during the winter 
varied from 6 to 11 hours in direct sunlight and from 23 to 38 hours in shade. 
No significant seasonal variation was observed in the inactivation of the 
bacteriophage MS2. Enteric viruses are expected to show inactivation rates 
similar to MS2. The results show that rapid inactivation of enteric bacteria can 
be expected on grass surface irrigated with treated effluent at higher ambient 
temperatures, in direct sunlight and low moisture content.

High relaxivity gadolinium hydroxypyridonate-viral capsid conjugates: nanosized 
MRI contrast agents.

94720-1460, USA.

High relaxivity macromolecular contrast agents based on the conjugation of 
gadolinium chelates to the interior and exterior surfaces of MS2 viral capsids 
are assessed. The proton nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion (NMRD) profiles 
of the conjugates show up to a 5-fold increase in relaxivity, leading to a peak 
relaxivity (per Gd3+ ion) of 41.6 mM(-1) s(-1) at 30 MHz for the internally 
modified capsids. Modification of the exterior was achieved through conjugation 
to flexible lysines, while internal modification was accomplished by conjugation 
to relatively rigid tyrosines. Higher relaxivities were obtained for the 
internally modified capsids, showing that (i) there is facile diffusion of water 
to the interior of capsids and (ii) the rigidity of the linker attaching the 
complex to the macromolecule is important for obtaining high relaxivity 
enhancements. The viral capsid conjugated gadolinium hydroxypyridonate complexes 
appear to possess two inner-sphere water molecules (q = 2), and the NMRD 
fittings highlight the differences in the local motion for the internal (tauRl = 
440 ps) and external (tauRl = 310 ps) conjugates. These results indicate that 
there are significant advantages of using the internal surface of the capsids 
for contrast agent attachment, leaving the exterior surface available for the 
installation of tissue targeting groups.

Biological machines composed of RNAs and proteins play essential roles in many 
biological processes. To better understand the mechanism and function of these 
machines, it is critical to isolate them in a highly purified and functional 
form. A method for isolating functional RNA-protein complexes assembled in vitro 
is described. The approach combines gel filtration and an 
affinity-chromatography strategy using the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein, which 
binds to a specific RNA-hairpin structure. Using this method, highly purified 
and functional human spliceosomes have been isolated. The purified spliceosome 
preparation is used to determine the protein components of the spliceosome by 
mass spectrometry and to examine the structure of the spliceosome by electron 
microscopy.

In situ ammonia production as a sanitation agent during anaerobic digestion at 
mesophilic temperature.

University of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden. jakob.ottoson@bvf.slu.se

AIM: To measure the sanitizing effect of mesophilic (37 degrees C) anaerobic 
digestion in high ammonia concentrations produced in situ.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Indicator organisms and salmonella were transferred to 
small-scale anaerobic batch cultures and D-values were calculated. Batch 
cultures were started with material from two biogas processes operating at high 
(46 mmol l(-1)) and low (1.6 mmol l(-1)) ammonia concentration. D-values were 
shortened from c. 3 days to <1 day for the bacteria. MS2 had the same D-value 
(1.3 days) independent of ammonia concentration whereas PhiX174 and 28B were 
faster inactivated in the control (1.1 and 7.9 days) than in the high ammonia 
(8.9 and 39 days) batch cultures.
CONCLUSION: Running biogas processes at high levels of ammonia shortens the time 
to meet EU regulation concerning reduction of salmonella and enterococci (5 
log). Unless a minimum retention time of 2 days, post-treatment digestion is 
needed to achieve sufficient sanitation in continuous biogas processes.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Running mesophilic biogas processes at 
high ammonia level produces residue with a high fertilizer value. With some 
stipulations concerning management parameters, such processes provide a method

The prevalence of human enteric viruses in bivalve molluscan shellfish and 
shrimp collected off the south west coast of India was studied to assess the 
extent of fecal pollution of coastal environment. Out of 194 samples analyzed, 
37% of oyster, 46% of clam and 15% of shrimp samples were positive for 
enteroviruses (EV). Adenoviruses (ADV) were detected in 17% of oyster and 27% of 
clam samples. However, other enteric viruses such as noroviruses (NoV) and 
hepatitis A virus (HAV) were not detected in any of the samples. High prevalence 
of EV and ADV was noticed between May to December. Thirty four percent of oyster 
and 49% of clam samples showed fecal coliform values higher than the limit. MS-2 
phage was detected in 57% of oyster and 73% of clam samples. The presence of 
MS-2 phage and human enteric viruses showed association while fecal coliforms 
and enteric viruses showed no association. However, 17 samples, which were 
positive for enteric viruses (EV and ADV), were negative for MS-2 phage.

Genotyping of F+ RNA bacteriophages has been used to distinguish between human 
and animal contributions to contaminated water and food. There are four 
genetically distinct genogroups of F+ RNA bacteriophages. Genogroups I and IV 
predominate in animal wastes and genogroups II and III in wastes of human 
origin. In this study, a multiplex real-time RT-PCR-based method was developed 
to detect and genotype F+ RNA bacteriophages. The assay was shown to be broadly 
reactive against a wide spectrum of F+ RNA bacteriophage strains, including MS2, 
GA, Q beta, MX1, SP and FI, and was able to detect and genotype F+ RNA 
bacteriophages in shellfish and river water. The assay is highly sensitive, with 
detection limits <10 PFU/reaction and <10 copies/reaction of the target 
sequences carried in plasmids, respectively. The applications of this assay 
include F+ RNA semi-quantitation and microbial source tracking.

operated household-scale slow sand filter.

Point-of-use (POU) drinking water treatment technology enables those without 
access to safe water sources to improve the quality of their water by treating 
it in the home. One of the most promising emerging POU technologies is the 
biosand filter (BSF), a household-scale, intermittently operated slow sand 
filter. Over 500,000 people in developing countries currently use the filters to 
treat their drinking water. However, despite this successful implementation, 
there has been almost no systematic, process engineering research to 
substantiate the effectiveness of the BSF or to optimize its design and 
operation. The major objectives of this research were to: (1) gain an 
understanding of the hydraulic flow condition within the filter (2) characterize 
the ability of the BSF to reduce the concentration of enteric bacteria and 
viruses in water and (3) gain insight into the key parameters of filter 
operation and their effects on filter performance. Three 6-8 week microbial 
challenge experiments are reported herein in which local surface water was 
seeded with E. coli, echovirus type 12 and bacteriophages (MS2 and PRD-1) and 
charged to the filter daily. Tracer tests indicate that the BSF operated at 
hydraulic conditions closely resembling plug flow. The performance of the filter 
in reducing microbial concentrations was highly dependent upon (1) filter 
ripening over weeks of operation and (2) the daily volume charged to the filter. 
BSF performance was best when less than one pore volume (18.3-L in the filter 
design studied) was charged to the filter per day and this has important 
implications for filter design and operation. Enhanced filter performance due to 
ripening was generally observed after roughly 30 days. Reductions of E. coli B 
ranged from 0.3 log10 (50%) to 4 log10, with geometric mean reductions after at 
least 30 days of operation of 1.9 log10. Echovirus 12 reductions were comparable 
to those for E. coli B with a range of 1 log10 to >3 log10 and mean reductions 
after 30 days of 2.1 log10. Bacteriophage reductions were much lower, ranging 
from zero to 1.3 log10 (95%) with mean reductions of only 0.5 log10 (70%). These 
data indicate that virus reduction by BSF may differ substantially depending 
upon the specific viral agent.

Biofilms colonizing surfaces inside drinking water distribution networks may 
provide a habitat and shelter to pathogenic viruses and parasites. If released 
from biofilms, these pathogens may disseminate in the water distribution system 
and cause waterborne diseases. Our study aimed to investigate the interactions 
of protozoan parasites (Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia lamblia [oo]cysts) 
and viruses (vaccinal poliovirus type 1, phiX174, and MS2) with two contrasting 
biofilms. First, attachment, persistence, and detachment of the protozoan 
parasites and the viruses were assessed with a drinking water biofilm. This 
biofilm was allowed to develop inside a rotating annular reactor fed with tap 
water for 7 months prior to the inoculation. Our results show that viable 
parasites and infectious viruses attached to the drinking water biofilm within 1 
h and persisted within the biofilm. Indeed, infectious viruses were detected in 
the drinking water biofilm up to 6 days after the inoculation, while viral 
genome and viable parasites were still detected at day 34, corresponding to the 
last day of the monitoring period. Since viral genome was detected much longer 
than infectious particles, our results raise the question of the significance of 
detecting viral genomes in biofilms. A transfer of viable parasites and viruses 
from the biofilm to the water phase was observed after the flow velocity was 
increased but also with a constant laminar flow rate. Similar results regarding 
parasite and virus attachment and detachment were obtained using a treated 
wastewater biofilm, suggesting that our observations might be extrapolated to a 
wide range of environmental biofilms and confirming that biofilms can be 
considered a potential secondary source of contamination.

The presence of air-water interface in batch sorption experiments may result in 
inaccurate estimation of virus adsorption onto various soils. A batch sorption 
experiment was conducted to compare the adsorption results of MS2 in different 
soils under presence/absence of air-water interface. Soils with 
sterilization/nonterilization treatment were used. Virus recovery efficiency in 
a blank experiment (no soil) was also evaluated as affected by different amount 
of air-water interface. The presence of air-water interface altered the results 
of virus adsorption in different soils with different extent, with Sandy 
fluvo-aquic soil being the most considerably affected, followed by Red loam 
soil, and the least being Red clay soil, probably because of different soil 
properties associated with virus adsorption/inactivation. Soil sterilization 
resulted in more significant difference of virus adsorption onto the Sandy 
fluvo-aquic soil between the presence and absence of air-water interface, while 
a reduced difference was observed in the Red loam soil. The presence of 
air-water interface significantly decreased virus recovery efficiency, with the 
values being decreased with increase in the amount of air-water interface. Soil 
particles likely prohibit viruses from reaching the air-water interface or alter 
the forces at the solid-water-air interface so that the results from the blank 
experiment did not truly represent results from control blank, which probably 
resulted in adsorption difference between presence and absence of the air-water 
interface.

Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China.

RNase-resistant, noninfectious virus-like particles containing exogenous RNA 
sequences (armored RNA) are good candidates as RNA controls and standards in RNA 
virus detection. However, the length of RNA packaged in the virus-like particles 
with high efficiency is usually less than 500 bases. In this study, we describe 
a method for producing armored L-RNA. Armored L-RNA is a complex of MS2 
bacteriophage coat protein and RNA produced in Escherichia coli by the induction 
of a two-plasmid coexpression system in which the coat protein and maturase are 
expressed from one plasmid and the target RNA sequence with modified MS2 
stem-loop (pac site) is transcribed from another plasmid. A 3V armored L-RNA of 
2,248 bases containing six gene fragments-hepatitis C virus, severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV1, SARS-CoV2, and SARS-CoV3), avian 
influenza virus matrix gene (M300), and H5N1 avian influenza virus (HA300)-was 
successfully expressed by the two-plasmid coexpression system and was 
demonstrated to have all of the characteristics of armored RNA. We evaluated the 
3V armored L-RNA as a calibrator for multiple virus assays. We used the WHO 
International Standard for HCV RNA (NIBSC 96/790) to calibrate the chimeric 
armored L-RNA, which was diluted by 10-fold serial dilutions to obtain samples 
containing 10(6) to 10(2) copies. In conclusion, the approach we used for 
armored L-RNA preparation is practical and could reduce the labor and cost of 
quality control in multiplex RNA virus assays. Furthermore, we can assign the 
chimeric armored RNA with an international unit for quantitative detection.

Aggregation and surface properties of F-specific RNA phages: implication for 
membrane filtration processes.

We report an experimental investigation of the electrokinetic properties and 
size variations of four F-specific bacteriophages of the types MS2, GA, Qbeta 
and SP (21-30 nm in diameter) over a broad range of pH values (1.5-7.5) and 
NaNO3 electrolyte concentrations (1-100 mM). The results obtained by dynamic 
light scattering show that the aggregation of SP and GA particles takes place 
over the whole range of pH and ionic strength conditions examined. For MS2 
phages, the aggregation of MS2 particles is not observed for pH higher than the 
isoelectric point (pI) and large ionic strengths for which interparticular 
repulsive electrostatic interactions are however expected to be sufficiently 
screened. Aggregation of the MS2 phages, dispersed in 1 and 100 mM electrolyte 
concentration, occurs at pH 4, which basically corresponds to the pI as 
determined by electrophoresis measurements. The Qbeta particles suspended in 
solutions of low electrolyte concentrations aggregate at low pH values (pI 
approximately 3) and, unlike MS2, at large ionic strengths over the whole range 
of pH conditions considered in this study. These elements allow the 
determination of the hydrophobic sequence for the four phages SP approximately 
GA>Qbeta>MS2. Close inspection of the electrokinetic results reveals small to 
significant variations of the pI values-depending on the phage considered-with 
respect to the concentration of indifferent NaNO3 electrolyte. This indicates 
that features other than chemical and electrostatic in nature play a key role in 
determining the pI and more generally the electrophoretic mobility mu of viral 
particles. A qualitative interpretation is given and is based on the 
consideration of inner electro-osmotic flow within the isolated or aggregated 
particles. The impact of the flow properties within the particles is further in 
agreement with recent theoretical formalism developed for the electrokinetics of 
soft multiplayer particles, the phages analyzed here being some illustrative 
examples. The determination and qualitative interpretation of the surface 
properties of the viral particles as reported in the current study are commented 
within the context of water treatment especially concerning viral removal by 
membrane filtration processes.

OBJECTIVE: To screen the suitable bacteriophage as virus indicator in 
irradiation sterilization.
METHODS: Suspensions of bacteriophage T4, phiX174D, MS2, and f2, Escherichia 
coli 8099, and Bacillus subtilis var.niger.sp. ATCC9372 were irradiated with 
(60)Co-gamma ray. The mean log(10) inactivation value (LIV) and killing log 
value (KL) were calculated.
RESULTS: (1) Under 100 Gy of gamma-radiation, the LIV levels of the 
bacteriophage T4, PhiX174, f2, and MS2 were 6.31, 6.92, 5.74, and 4.46 log(10) 
respectively, all reaching the disinfection level (LIV >/= 4.00 log(10)), (2) 
Under the same absorbed dose, the KL of Escherichia coli 8099 was > 7.97 
log(10); (3) Under the same absorbed dose, the KL of the Bacillus subtilis 
var.niger.sp. ATCC9372 was 1.61 log(10).
CONCLUSION: The order of resistance of the above six microorganisms to 
gamma-radiation from the biggest to the smallest is as follows: Bacillus 
subtilis var. niger. sp. > bacteriophage MS2 > bacteriophage f2 > bacteriophage 
T4 > bacteriophage phiX 174D > E. coli.

A tethering approach to study proteins that activate mRNA turnover in human 
cells.

Clement SL(1), Lykke-Andersen J.

Author information:
(1)Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology, University of 
Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA.

The regulation of mRNA turnover occurs in part through the action of 
mRNA-binding proteins that recognize specific nucleotide sequences and either 
activate or inhibit the decay of transcripts to which they are bound. In many 
cases, multiple mRNA-binding proteins, including those with opposing functions, 
bind to the same RNA sequence. This can make the study of the function of any 
one of these proteins difficult. Furthermore, monitoring endogenous mRNA decay 
rates using drugs that inhibit transcription (e.g., actinomycin D) can introduce 
pleiotropic effects. One way to circumvent these problems is to tether the 
protein of interest (POI) through a heterologous RNA-binding domain to an 
inducible reporter mRNA and measure the effect of the bound protein on mRNA 
decay. In this chapter, we illustrate the use of the tethering technique to 
study the role of a particular mRNA-binding protein, TTP, on the decay of an 
otherwise stable mRNA to which it is tethered through a fusion to the 
bacteriophage MS2 coat protein.

Enteric viruses are key foodborne pathogens. The objective of this study was to 
compare the relative contributions of electrostatic and hydrophobic forces with 
the nonspecific attachment of virus to butterhead lettuce. The attachment of 
four viruses (echovirus 11, feline calicivirus [FCV], MS2, and phiX174) was 
studied. Three different conditions, namely (i) 1% Tween 80, (ii) 1 M NaCl, and 
(iii) 1% Tween 80 with 1 M NaCl, were investigated to determine the role of 
hydrophobic, electrostatic, and combined hydrophobic and electrostatic forces, 
respectively. Attachment above the pI of FCV and echovirus 11 was reduced or 
eliminated in the presence of NaCl, indicating an electrostatic interaction 
between the animal viruses and lettuce. The bacteriophage phiX174 was not 
significantly affected by any treatment, indicating a lack of electrostatic or 
hydrophobic interactions between the lettuce and phage phiX174. Overall, 1 M 
NaCl was the most effective treatment in desorbing viruses from the surface of 
lettuce at pH 7 and 8. The results imply that electrostatic forces play a major 
role in controlling virus adsorption to lettuce. The results indicate that 1 M 
NaCl solution would improve the recovery or elution of unenveloped viruses from 
lettuce.

This study focused on ultrafiltration as a technique for simultaneously 
concentrating and recovering viruses, bacteria and parasites in 100-L drinking 
water samples. A chemical dispersant, sodium polyphosphate, and Tween 80 were 
used to increase microbial recovery efficiencies. Secondary concentration was 
performed to reduce sample volumes to 3-5 mL for analysis using tissue culture, 
microscopy, and real-time PCR and RT-PCR. At seeding levels of 100-1000 (CFU, 
PFU, oocysts, or particles), a "high-flux" ultrafiltration procedure was found 
to achieve mean recoveries of 51-94% of simultaneously seeded MS2 bacteriophage, 
echovirus 1, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium, Bacillus 
atrophaeus subsp. globigii endospores, Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts, and 
4.5-mum microspheres. When 4-7% of the final sample concentrate volume was 
assayed using real-time PCR and RT-PCR, overall method sensitivities were <100 
C. parvum oocysts, <240 PFU echovirus 1, <100 CFU Salmonella and approximately 
160 CFU B. atrophaeus spores in 100-L drinking water samples. The "high-flux" 
ultrafiltration procedure required approximately 2 h, including time required 
for backflushing. Secondary concentration procedures required an additional 1-3 
h, while nucleic acid extraction and real-time PCR procedures required an 
additional 2-2.5 h. Thus, this study demonstrated that efficient recovery and 
sensitive detection of diverse microbes in 100-L drinking water samples could be 
achieved within 5-8 h using ultrafiltration, rapid secondary processing 
techniques, and real-time PCR.

Real time reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) is now used commonly for the 
detection of viral pathogens in respiratory samples. However, due to potential 
inhibition of the RT-PCR or inefficient extraction, this sample type can present 
significant challenges to accurate patient testing. The goal of this study was 
to create an internal control to be multiplexed in a real time RT-PCR assay for 
detecting a viral target in respiratory samples. This report describes an 
Armored RNA (aRNA) internal control developed originally to be multiplexed in a 
real time RT-PCR assay for detecting SARS-associated Coronavirus, but can be 
incorporated into any RT-PCR assay. The internal control primers and probe 
target a region in the coat protein gene of the E. coli F-specific bacteriophage 
ms2, which is contained within the aRNA.

Interactions between viruses and goethite during saturated flow: effects of 
solution pH, carbonate, and phosphate.

Environmental Biotechnology, The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996, 
USA.

Metal oxides have great potential for controlling the fate and transport of 
viruses in the subsurface and water-treatment systems. The processes, however, 
are subject to solution chemistry. In this study, a number of column experiments 
were conducted to examine the effects of solution pH and anions (carbonate and 
phosphate) on attachment, transport, and inactivation of two bacteriophages 
(phiX174 and MS-2) in goethite-coated sand medium. Removal of both viruses on 
goethite-coated sand increased as solution pH decreased from 9.3 to 7.5, due 
mostly to virus inactivation. MS-2, a relatively hydrophobic virus with a lower 
isoelectric point (3.9), was more sensitive to the change of solution pH than 
phiX174, a relatively hydrophilic virus with a higher isoelectric point (6.6), 
in terms of their attachment and inactivation on goethite. About 90% of the MS-2 
particles removed by goethite (accounting for 81% of the total input) were 
inactivated at pH 7.5, whereas all of the removed MS-2 particles (accounting for 
10% of the total input) still remained infectious at pH 9.3. In comparison, 
approximately 74% of the goethite-bound phiX174 particles (accounting for 95% of 
the total input) lost their infectivity at pH 7.5, in contrast to a complete 
recovery at pH 9.3 (accounting for 65% of the total input) when the columns were 
eluted using a beef extract solution (pH 9.5). Presence of phosphate (20 mM 
H(2)PO(4)(-)) in input solution reduced virus attachment and appeared to protect 
the viruses from being inactivated during transport; this effect was more 
significant on MS-2 than on phiX174. Specifically, approximately 29% of the 
phiX174 particles and approximately 49% of MS-2 particles injected into the 
column were removed during transport. Mass recovery data showed that no phiX174 
was inactivated in the presence of phosphate, whereas about 38% of the MS-2 
particles attached on goethite lost their infectivity. Conversely, presence of 
carbonate on goethite increased virus attachment and inactivation due to 
contribution of additional attachment sites from protonated surface groups of 
the carbonate ions that were adsorbed on goethite. About 70% of the total input 
viruses (both phiX174 and MS-2) were removed during transport, of which 35% 
phiX174 and 85% MS-2 were eventually inactivated.

[Interaction of RNA-containing bacteriophages with the host cells: MS2-induced 
E. coli mutants and formation of DNA-containing derivatives of MS2 
bacteriophage].

[Article in Russian]

Pererva TP, Miriuta AIu, Miriuta NIu.

Sensitive cells of Escherichia coli AB 259 Hfr 3000 infected with RNA-containing 
phage MS2 produce phage particles and continue to divide showing segregation of 
sensitive cells maintaining new infection cycles. Phage multiplication in 
sensitive cells gives rise to phage resistant forms in their progeny. The 
described phenomenon has been shown to be due not to pre-existing 
phage-resistant cell selection but is a result of interaction of the phage and 
the cell. In contrast to the usual spontaneous or chemically induced Escherichia 
coli mutants MS2-induced phage-resistant cells are genetically unstable. During 
their reproduction they segregate new MS2-resistant types carrying more 
significant changes in the region coded by the sex factor. Cells belonging to 
two final MS2-induced mutants also produce a new type of phages; they are 
DNA-containing forms neutralized, however, by anti-MS2 serum. Production of such 
phage proves that genetic moiety of RNA-containing phage is able to be expressed 
as a part of the DNA structure.

PURPOSE: We have developed a modular synthetic strategy to append imaging agents 
to a viral capsid.
PROCEDURES: The hollow protein shell of bacteriophage MS2 (mtMS2) was labeled on 
its inside surface with [18F]fluorobenzaldehyde through a multistep 
bioconjugation strategy. An aldehyde functional group was first attached to 
interior tyrosine residues through a diazonium coupling reaction. The aldehyde 
was further elaborated to an alkoxyamine functional group, which was then 
condensed with n.c.a. [18F]fluorobenzaldehyde. Biodistribution of the 
radioactive MS2 conjugates was subsequently evaluated in Sprague-Dawley rats.
RESULTS: Relative to fluorobenzaldehyde, fluorine-18-labeled MS2 exhibited 
prolonged blood circulation time and a significantly altered excretion profile. 
It was also observed that additional small molecule cargo installed inside the 
capsids did not alter the biodistribution.
CONCLUSIONS: These studies provide further insight into the pharmacokinetic 
behavior of nanomaterials and serve as a platform for the future development of 
targeted imaging and therapeutic agents based on mtMS2.

Pennsylvania, Edinboro, PA 16444, USA.

Tetrahymena has been shown to ingest and inactivate bacteriophages, such as T4, 
in co-incubation experiments. In this study, Tetrahymena thermophila failed to 
inactivate phages PhiX174 and MS2 in co-incubations, although PhiX174 were 
ingested by T. thermophila, as demonstrated by: (1) recovery at defecation in a 
pulse-chase experiment, (2) recovery from Tetrahymena by detergent lysis, and 
(3) transmission electron microscopy. We conclude, therefore, that the phages 
must be digestion-resistant. Internalized PhiX174 were further shown to be 
partially protected from lethal damage by ultraviolet (UV) C and UVB 
irradiation. Finally, ingested PhiX174 were shown to be rapidly transported 
through buffer in a horizontal swimming, race tube-like assay. The transport and 
protection of phages may confer evolutionary advantages that explain the 
acquisition of digestion-resistance by some phages.

Filter performance of n99 and n95 facepiece respirators against viruses and 
ultrafine particles.

The performance of three filtering facepiece respirators (two models of N99 and 
one N95) challenged with an inert aerosol (NaCl) and three virus aerosols 
(enterobacteriophages MS2 and T4 and Bacillus subtilis phage)-all with 
significant ultrafine components-was examined using a manikin-based protocol 
with respirators sealed on manikins. Three inhalation flow rates, 30, 85, and 
150 l min(-1), were tested. The filter penetration and the quality factor were 
determined. Between-respirator and within-respirator comparisons of penetration 
values were performed. At the most penetrating particle size (MPPS), >3% of MS2 
virions penetrated through filters of both N99 models at an inhalation flow rate 
of 85 l min(-1). Inhalation airflow had a significant effect upon particle 
penetration through the tested respirator filters. The filter quality factor was 
found suitable for making relative performance comparisons. The MPPS for 
challenge aerosols was <0.1 mum in electrical mobility diameter for all tested 
respirators. Mean particle penetration (by count) was significantly increased 
when the size fraction of <0.1 mum was included as compared to particles >0.1 
mum. The filtration performance of the N95 respirator approached that of the two 
models of N99 over the range of particle sizes tested ( approximately 0.02 to 
0.5 mum). Filter penetration of the tested biological aerosols did not exceed 
that of inert NaCl aerosol. The results suggest that inert NaCl aerosols may 
generally be appropriate for modeling filter penetration of similarly sized 
virions.

imaging.

Intracellular mRNA localization is a common mechanism to achieve asymmetric 
distributions of proteins. Previous studies have revealed that in a number of 
cell types, different mRNA species are localized by the same transport 
machinery. However, it has been unclear if these individual mRNA species are 
specifically sorted into separate or common ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles 
before or during transport. Using budding yeast as a model system, we analyzed 
the intracellular movement of individual pairs of localized mRNA in live cells. 
Yeast cells localize more than 20 different mRNAs to the bud with the help of 
the Myo4p/She3p/She2p protein complex. For live cell imaging, mRNA pairs were 
tagged with tandem repeats of either bacteriophage MS2 or lambda boxB RNA 
sequences and fluorescently labeled by fusion protein constructs that bind to 
the RNA tag sequences. Using three-dimensional, single-particle tracking with 
dual-color detection, we have tracked the transport of two different localized 
mRNA species in real time. Our observations show that different localized mRNAs 
are coassembled into common RNP particles and cotransported in a directional 
manner to the target site. Nonlocalized mRNAs or mutant mRNAs that lack 
functional localization signals form separate particles that are not transported 
to the bud. This study reveals a high degree of co-ordination of mRNA 
trafficking in budding yeast.

target unique pentad sequences in single-stranded RNA.

mRNA interferases are sequence-specific endoribonucleases encoded by 
toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems in bacterial genomes. Previously, we demonstrated 
that Mycobacterium tuberculosis contains at least seven genes encoding MazF 
homologues (MazF-mt1 to -mt7) and determined cleavage specificities for MazF-mt1 
and MazF-mt6. Here we have developed a new general method for the determination 
of recognition sequences longer than three bases for mRNA interferases with the 
use of phage MS2 RNA as a substrate and CspA, an RNA chaperone, which prevents 
the formation of secondary structures in the RNA substrate. Using this method, 
we determined that MazF-mt3 cleaves RNA at UU CCU or CU CCU and MazF-mt7 at U 
CGCU ( indicates the cleavage site). As pentad sequence recognition is more 
specific than those of previously characterized mRNA interferases, 
bioinformatics analysis was carried out to identify M. tuberculosis mRNAs that 
may be resistant to MazF-mt3 and MazF-mt7 cleavage. The pentad sequence was 
found to be significantly underrepresented in several genes, including members 
of the PE and PPE families, large families of proteins that play a role in 
tuberculosis immunity and pathogenesis. These data suggest that MazF-mt3 and 
MazF-mt7 or other mRNA interferases that target longer RNA sequences may alter 
protein expression through differential mRNA degradation, a regulatory mechanism 
that may allow adaptation to environmental conditions, including those 
encountered by pathogens such as M. tuberculosis during infection.

Studies undertaken to assess the performance of filter materials to remove 
phosphorus in decentralised sewage systems have not reported on the broader 
performance of these systems. This study aimed to identify virus fate and 
transport mechanisms at the laboratory scale for comparison with field 
experiments on a mound system amended with blast furnace slag. Inactivation was 
a significant removal mechanism for MS2 bacteriophage, but not for PRD1 
bacteriophage. Column studies identified rapid transport of PRD1. Laboratory 
studies predicted lower removal of PRD1 in a full scale system than was 
experienced in the field study, highlighting the importance of considering pH 
and flow rate in pathogen removal estimates. The results highlight the necessity 
for studying a range of organisms when assessing the potential for pathogen 
transport.

Immunogenic display of diverse peptides on virus-like particles of RNA phage 
MS2.

The high level of immunogenicity of peptides displayed in dense repetitive 
arrays on virus-like particles makes recombinant VLPs promising vaccine 
carriers. Here, we describe a platform for vaccine development based on the VLPs 
of RNA bacteriophage MS2. It serves for the engineered display of specific 
peptide sequences, but will also allow the construction of random peptide 
libraries from which specific binding activities can be recovered by affinity 
selection. Peptides representing the V3 loop of HIV gp120 and the ECL2 loop of 
the HIV coreceptor, CCR5, were inserted into a surface loop of MS2 coat protein. 
Both insertions disrupted coat VLP assembly, apparently by interfering with 
protein folding, but these defects were suppressed efficiently by genetically 
fusing coat protein's two identical polypeptides into a single-chain dimer. The 
resulting VLPs displayed the V3 and ECL2 peptides on their surfaces where they 
showed the potent immunogenicity that is the hallmark of VLP-displayed antigens. 
Experiments with random-sequence peptide libraries show the single-chain dimer 
to be highly tolerant of six, eight and ten amino acid insertions. MS2 VLPs 
support the display of a wide diversity of peptides in a highly immunogenic 
format, and they encapsidate the mRNAs that direct their synthesis, thus 
establishing the genotype/phenotype linkage necessary for recovery of 
affinity-selected sequences. The single-chain MS2 VLP therefore unites in a 
single structural platform the selective power of phage display with the high 
immunogenicity of VLPs.

Inactivation of MS2 F(+) coliphage on lettuce by a combination of UV light and 
hydrogen peroxide.

The efficacy of a produce decontamination method based on a combination of UV 
light (254 nm) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to inactivate the MS2 F(+) coliphage 
inoculated onto iceberg lettuce was evaluated. Lettuce inoculated with 6.57 log 
PFU of MS2 was reduced by 0.5 to 1.0 log unit when illuminated with UV light 
alone for 20 to 60 s (12.64 to 18.96 mJ/cm2). In contrast, a 3-log reduction in 
MS2 was achieved with 2% (vol/vol) H2O2 spray delivered at 50 degrees C. No 
significant increase in log count reduction (LCR) was observed when H2O2 and UV 
light were applied simultaneously. However, H2O2 sprayed onto lettuce samples 
for 10 s, followed by a further 20-s UV illumination, resulted in an LCR of 4.12 
that compares with the 1.67 obtained with 200 ppm of calcium hypochlorite wash. 
No further increase in MS2 inactivation was achieved by the use of either longer 
H2O2 spray or UV illumination times. The extent of MS2 reduction was 
significantly (P < 0.05) decreased when the H2O2 spray was delivered at 10 or 25 
degrees C compared with 50 degrees C. In the course of aerobic storage at 4 
degrees C, lettuce treated with UV light and H2O2 (10 or 25 degrees C) developed 
discoloration (polyphenol accumulation) within 6 days. In contrast, lettuce 
treated with UV light and H2O2 at 50 degrees C developed less discoloration 
within this time period and was comparable to untreated controls. This study 
demonstrated that the combination of UV light and H2O2 represents an alternative 
to hypochlorite-based washes to reduce the carriage of viruses on fresh produce.

Disinfection of produce is principally used to inactivate spoilage microbes and 
may also reduce the risk of consumer exposure to enteric pathogens. However, the 
rate and extent of enteric virus inactivation by free chlorine on produce has 
not been adequately characterized. Experiments were performed to determine the 
kinetics of free chlorine inactivation of hepatitis A virus (HAV) and the 
indicator virus coliphage MS2 on strawberries (SBs), cherry tomatoes (CTs), and 
head lettuce (HL). The oxidant demand of these produce items also was 
determined. When produce items were exposed to approximately 20 parts per 
million (ppm) solution of free chlorine for 5-10 min, HAV and MS2 were 
inactivated by 90-99% and in some cases virus inactivation was > or =99%. 
Exposure of strawberries to approximately 200 ppm free chlorine resulted in more 
rapid and extensive inactivation of both viruses. The produce items tested in 
this study exhibited a demand for chlorine which varied by produce type, and 
chlorine residuals declined over time. These results demonstrate the potential 
for chlorine to reduce the levels of infectious viruses on different produce 
types, but adequate contact time and chlorine residual are required to achieve 
maximum virus inactivation. The difference in chlorine demand between SBs, CTs, 
and HL suggests that varying disinfection practices are needed for the wide 
variety of processed fruits and vegetables. The inactivation kinetics of MS2 and 
HAV were similar, suggesting that MS2 and perhaps other similar bacterial 
viruses may be used as process indicators and surrogates for determining the 
disinfection efficacy of produce in the laboratory or in actual practice.

Washington University, Box 1198, St Louis, Missouri 63130.

This article describes a model for forced-flow electrophoresis (FFE), 
considering the desired species fraction removal, other fraction removals, and 
outlet concentrations of all species in the system. The model predicts the 
necessary inlet flow rate of the retentate chamber and the rate of filtration 
and the voltage gradient and also provides an appropriate heat balance 
permitting consideration of possible heat denaturation of the species. The 
equipment consists of two membranes and a filter, the electric field being 
imposed by means of external electrodes, and two fractions are obtainable. The 
main discriminating factor is not the pore sizes of the filter but the relative 
solute ionization, which depends on the pH and the ionic strength of the buffer 
solution. Serum proteins (albumin, gamma-globulin) and bacteriophages (M13, MS2, 
phiX174) have been used to characterize the separation process.

Enteric viruses are important agents of foodborne disease. Unfortunately, 
robust, quantitative methods for sampling and analysis of enteric and other 
viruses in processed or complex foods are not well-established. As a result, 
epidemiologically determined etiologies or pathogen sources in foodborne 
outbreaks are rarely confirmed by virological analysis. In this study, an 
acid-adsorption elution concentration (AEC) method previously used to monitor 
virus occurrence and investigate enteric virus outbreaks in shellfish was 
adapted for examination of processed food items, namely tomato sauce and blended 
strawberries. Hepatitis A virus (HAV), poliovirus, and coliphage MS2 (MS2) were 
seeded in 10 or 30 g samples of tomato sauce or blended strawberries, recovered 
by AEC, and quantified by cell culture infectivity assay. In addition, nested 
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and TaqMan RT-PCR 
assays were used to detect HAV RNA. Viruses were efficiently adsorbed to foods 
as an initial concentration step, with infectious HAV and MS2 adsorption of 67% 
and 93%, respectively, to tomato sauce, and 89% and 99%, respectively, to 
blended strawberries. Forty-three to 65% of HAV and poliovirus were subsequently 
eluted and recovered from tomato sauce using 0.5 M threonine, pH 7.2. The lower 
limits of HAV detection were at initial seeding levels of 14 PFU/g of tomato 
sauce and 33 PFU/g of blended strawberries. Unlike TaqMan RT-PCR, nested RT-PCR 
was not inhibited by undiluted final RNA extracts of tomato sauce or blended 
strawberries. The successful adaptation of the AEC method for enteric and other 
virus recovery, quantitation and detection in processed foods demonstrates its 
potential for use in the investigation of foodborne outbreaks of viral etiology 
and for validation of virus disinfection and sanitary processing procedures used 
by the food industry.

OBJECTIVES: To construct a one-plasmid expression system of the armored RNA 
containing long chimeric RNA by increasing the number and affinity of the pac 
site.
METHODS: The plasmid pET-MS2-pac was constructed with one C-variant pac site, 
and then the plasmid pM-CR-2C containing 1,891-bp chimeric sequences and two 
C-variant pac sites was produced. Meanwhile, three plasmids (pM-CR-C, pM-CR-2W 
and pM-CR-W) were obtained as parallel controls with a different number and 
affinity of the pac site. Finally, the armored RNA was expressed and purified.
RESULTS: The armored RNA with 1,891 bases target RNA was expressed successfully 
by the one-plasmid expression system with two C-variant pac sites, while for one 
pac site, no matter whether the affinity was changed or not, only the 1,200 
bases target RNA was packaged. It was also found that the C-variant pac site 
could increase the expression efficiency of the armored RNA. The armored RNA 
with 1,891-bp exogenous RNA in our study showed the characterization of 
ribonuclease resistance and stability at different time points and temperature 
conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: The armored RNA with 1,891 bases exogenous RNA was constructed and 
the expression system can be used as a platform for preparation of the armored 
RNA containing long RNA sequences.

The objectives of our study were to determine (i) removal of bacteriophage MS2 
and phiX174, as surrogates for human pathogenic viruses, in an anoxic aquifer 
and (ii) the safe length of the microbial protection zone in anoxic aquifers. 
3.5 Log units of MS2 were removed by adsorption and inactivation during 63 days 
residence time, which was 1.4 log units lower than removal of phiX174. These 
removal rates were considerably lower than previously reported for MS2 and 
phiX174 in oxic aquifers and consequently longer protection zones around anoxic 
aquifers might be needed. Therefore, the observed log removal of MS2 was used in 
a risk assessment approach to determine the required safe length of the 
microbial protection zone. In case of a leaking sewer in the vicinity of a well 
in an anoxic aquifer, the risk assessment demonstrated that a microbial 
protection zone of 110 m may be needed to meet a risk of infection of 10(-4) 
persons per year. This length can be two to three times larger than the length 
of the protection zone currently used in a number of countries.

Coliphage MS2 is used in place of pathogens in many studies and is considered 
one of the indicators of pathogenetic viruses in wastewater. We developed a 
quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay to 
quantify MS2 coliphages in treated wastewater samples. The format used was SYBR 
Green. The assay included an internal control to disclose the presence of 
PCR-product inhibitors. The method had a wide dynamic range (8 logs) with a 
correlation coefficient of 0.999 and is capable of detecting as few as 4x10(2) 
genome equivalents/100 ml of wastewater sample. The method was validated by 
using artificially contaminated water samples. The validated method was then 
applied to naturally contaminated samples collected in a wastewater treatment 
plant and the results were compared with those obtained by a plaque assay. In 
comparison with the plaque assay the PCR-method yielded viral counts about 1.5 
orders of magnitude higher. The entire detection method, including sample 
processing and real-time PCR amplification, was completed within 4 hours, making 
it a rapid single-day method.

We present a general computational approach to simulate RNA folding kinetics 
that can be used to extract population kinetics, folding rates and the formation 
of particular substructures that might be intermediates in the folding process. 
Simulating RNA folding kinetics can provide unique insight into RNA whose 
functions are dictated by folding kinetics and not always by nucleotide sequence 
or the structure of the lowest free-energy state. The method first builds an 
approximate map (or model) of the folding energy landscape from which the 
population kinetics are analyzed by solving the master equation on the map. We 
present results obtained using an analysis technique, map-based Monte Carlo 
simulation, which stochastically extracts folding pathways from the map. Our 
method compares favorably with other computational methods that begin with a 
comprehensive free-energy landscape, illustrating that the smaller, approximate 
map captures the major features of the complete energy landscape. As a result, 
our method scales to larger RNAs. For example, here we validate kinetics of RNA 
of more than 200 nucleotides. Our method accurately computes the kinetics-based 
functional rates of wild-type and mutant ColE1 RNAII and MS2 phage RNAs showing 
excellent agreement with experiment.

changes in water quality regulations have led to a greater emphasis on 
alternative disinfection mechanisms. In this study, the efficacy of bench-scale 
and pilot-scale titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) photocatalytic disinfection was 
explored using four bacteriophages (MS2, PRD1, phi-X174, and fr). The optimized 
bench-scale experiments indicated that 1 mg/L of Degussa P25 TiO(2) irradiated 
by low-pressure ultraviolet (UV) light reduced the dose requirements for viral 
inactivation in comparison to UV light alone. The highest UV dose reductions for 
4-log inactivation of PRD1, MS2, phi-X174, and fr were 19%, 15%, 6%, and 0%, 
respectively. Bench-scale photocatalysis was inhibited by limited adsorption of 
the viruses onto the TiO(2) nanoparticles, as indicated by the poor results for 
high TiO(2) concentrations. Subsequently, pilot-scale experiments were completed 
using the Photo-Cat Lab from Purifics. The annular reactor configuration and 
increased viral adsorption dramatically improved photocatalytic inactivation for 
samples with high TiO(2) concentrations. Using the Photo-Cat Lab, 2-log 
inactivation of the bacteriophages was achieved with 400 mg/L of Degussa P25 
TiO(2) and a UV dose of approximately 34 mJ/cm(2) (energy consumption of 0.33 
kWh/m(3))-a 700-fold decrease in energy use compared to bench-scale 
photocatalysis.

This study reports on the use of naturally occurring F-specific coliphages, as 
well as spiked MS-2 phage, to evaluate a land-based effluent treatment/reuse 
system and an effluent irrigation scheme. Both the natural phages and the spiked 
MS-2 phage indicated that the effluent treatment/reuse system (FILTER - 
Filtration and Irrigated cropping for Land Treatment and Effluent Reuse) 
achieved a reduction in phage levels over the treatment system by one to two 
log10. FILTER reduced natural F-specific phage numbers from around 10(3) to 
below 10(2) 100-ml(-1) and the spiked phage from 10(5) to around 10(4) 
100-ml(-1) (incoming compared with outgoing water). In the effluent irrigation 
scheme, phage spiked into the holding ponds dropped from 10(6) to 10(2) 
100-ml(-1) after 168 h (with no detectable levels of natural F-specific phage 
being found prior to spiking). Only low levels of the spiked phage (10(2) 
gm(-1)) could be recovered from soil irrigated with phage-spiked effluent (at 
10(6) phage 100 ml(-1)) or from fruits (around 10(2) phage per fruit) that had 
direct contact with soil which had been freshly irrigated with the same 
phage-spiked effluent.

octahedral particles.

A covalent dimer of the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein was created by performing 
genetic fusion of two copies of the gene while removing the stop codon of the 
first gene. The dimer was crystallized in the cubic F432 space group. The 
organization of the asymmetric unit together with the F432 symmetry results in 
an arrangement of subunits that corresponds to T = 3 octahedral particles. The 
octahedral particles are probably artifacts created by the particular crystal 
packing. When it is not crystallized in the F cubic crystal form, the coat 
protein dimer appears to assemble into T = 3 icosahedral particles 
indistinguishable from the wild-type particles. To form an octahedral particle 
with closed surface, the dimer subunits interact at sharper angles than in the 
icosahedral arrangement. The fold of the covalent dimer is almost identical to 
the wild-type dimer with differences located in loops and in the covalent linker 
region. The main differences in the subunit packing between the octahedral and 
icosahedral arrangements are located close to the fourfold and fivefold symmetry 
axes where different sets of loops mediate the contacts. The volume of the 
wild-type virions is 7 times bigger than that of the octahedral particles.

Flaviviruses are positive RNA viruses that assemble the replication complex in 
the cytoplasm of the infected cells. In order to get a dynamic view of the 
formation and distribution of flavivirus genomes in living cells we engineered a 
tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) replicon with an array of binding sites for 
the phage MS2 core protein. The modified TBEV replicons were competent for RNA 
replication and allowed the visualization of replicated genomic RNA that 
accumulated in cytoplasmic structures with a distinct subcellular localization. 
Sites of TBEV replicated RNA accumulation were enriched in non-structural viral 
proteins and co-localized with the markers of the rough endoplasmic reticulum 
protein disulphide isomerase (PDI). In contrast no co-localization was observed 
with the markers CD-71 and EEA-1 for recycling vesicles, ERGIC53 for the 
intermediate compartment and TGN-46 for the trans-Golgi network. In human HOS 
cells, but not in hamster BHK21 cells, replicated TBEV RNA was found also 
associated with the marker Giantin for the Golgi indicating differences 
according to the cellular background. This study confirms and extends previous 
observations on the subcellular localization of flavivirus RNA and provides a 
useful tool to monitor the formation and distribution of flavivirus RNA genomes 
in living cells.

Source separation and reuse of human urine can decrease the environmental 
pollution of recipient waters and reduce the need for artificial mineral 
fertilisers. However, the reuse of urine introduces another pathogen 
transmission route that needs to be managed. The inactivation of enteric 
pathogens and model organisms (Salmonella enterica subspecies 1 serovar 
Typhimurium (S. typhimurium), Enterococcus faecalis, bacteriophages S. 
typhimurium 28B, MS2 and Phi x 174) by urine storage was studied at dilutions 
(urine:water) 1:0, 1:1 and 1:3 at temperatures 4, 14, 24 and 34 degrees C. A 
threshold concentration of ammonia was found at approximately 40 mM NH(3) (e.g. 
2.1 g NH(3)-NL(-1) and pH 8.9 at 24 degrees C), below which all studied 
organisms, except Salmonella, persisted considerably longer irrespective of 
treatment temperature, showing that urine dilution rate is of great importance 
for pathogen inactivation. For Salmonella spp. no threshold level was found in 
these studies (15 mM NH(3) lowest concentration studied). At temperatures below 
20 degrees C, bacteriophage reduction was very slow. Therefore, urine stored at 
temperatures below 20 degrees C carries a high risk of containing viable 
viruses. The study indicated that the current recommended storage time for urine 
of 6 months at 20 degrees C or higher is safe for unrestricted use and could 
probably be shortened, especially for undiluted urine.

Comparative survival of enteric indicators, E. coli and somatic and F-RNA 
bacteriophages on turf-grass irrigated with recycled water.

The aim of this study was to elucidate whether the current withholding period of 
4 hours following irrigation of public recreational areas with some classes of 
recycled water, as prescribed in some Australian state regulations, is valid or 
whether the holding time can be reduced under specified ambient conditions. A 
secondary objective was to evaluate laboratory simulations of ambient field 
conditions for microbial survival experiments. Results suggest that the 
currently prescribed 4 hour withholding period achieves a reduction of health 
risk associated with bacterial enteric pathogens that would not otherwise occur 
if the withholding period was reduced. However, this may not be the case for 
viral enteric pathogens as the survival of bacteriophages, PRD-1 and MS-2 on 
turf-grass did not significantly change even after 6 hours, except PRD-1 under 
high solar conditions. These results suggest that bacteriophages, PRD-1 and MS-2 
are more conservative indicators of enteric pathogen survival on UV exposed 
turf-grass compared with E. coli. The simulations of field conditions in the 
laboratory were somewhat problematic, with the variations in natural conditions 
that occur temporally, sometimes for short periods, difficult to reproduce.

Transport and retention of a bacteriophage and microspheres in saturated, 
angular porous media: effects of ionic strength and grain size.

Eight saturated column experiments were conducted to examine the effects of 
solution chemistry and grain size on the transport of colloids through crushed 
silica sand. Two sizes of colloids, 0.025-microm bacteriophage (MS-2) and 
1.5-microm carboxylated microspheres, were used as surrogates for the transport 
of pathogenic viruses and bacteria, respectively. Increasing the Ca(2+) 
concentration from 1 to 4.8 mM (along with background monovalent ions) resulted 
in complete attenuation (>6-log decrease in C/C(0)) of MS-2, but caused only a 
1-log reduction (C/C(0)=0.1) in the concentration of the microspheres. 
Decreasing grain size from medium sand (d(50)=0.70 mm) to fine sand (d(50)=0.34 
mm) resulted in substantial decreases in effluent concentrations of both the 
MS-2 (5-log decrease) and microspheres (>2.5-log decrease). Comparison of 
observed colloid retention to that predicted by a recently published correlation 
equation for colloid filtration revealed that the model can considerably 
underpredict (by 4 orders of magnitude or more) colloid retention by angular 
sand over distances as short as 20 cm. This indicates that state-of-the-art 
colloid filtration models are still limited in applicability to natural systems.

Treatment of coliphage MS2 with palladium-modified nitrogen-doped titanium oxide 
photocatalyst illuminated by visible light.

A palladium-modified nitrogen-doped titanium oxide (TiON/-PdO) photocatalytic 
fiber was synthesized on a mesoporous activated carbon fiber template by a 
sol-gel process. Calcination of the coated fibers resulted in a macroporous 
interfiber structure and mesoporous photocatalyst coating. Atomic ratios of 
major photocatalyst constituents determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 
analyses were N/Ti approximately equal to 0.1 and Pd/-Ti approximately equal to 
0.03. X-ray diffraction analyses revealed that the photocatalyst had an anatase 
structure and palladium additive was present as PdO. Triplicate batch 
experiments performed with MS2 phage (average initial concentration of 3 x 10(8) 
plaque forming units/mL) and TiON/PdO photocatalyst at a dose of 0.1 g/L under 
dark conditions revealed the occurrence of virus adsorption on the photocatalyst 
fibers at a rate that resulted in equilibrium within 1 h of contact time with 
corresponding virion removals of 95.4-96.7%. Subsequent illumination of the 
dark-equilibrated samples with visible light (wavelengths greater than 400 nm 
and average intensity of 40 mW/cm2) resulted in additional virus removal of 
94.5-98.2% within 1 h of additional contact time. By combining adsorption and 
visible-light photocatalysis, TiON/PdO fibers reached final virus removal rates 
of 99.75-99.94%. Spin trapping electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) 
measurements confirmed the production of *OH radicals by TiON/PdO under visible 
light illumination, which provided indirect evidence about MS2 phage being 
potentially inactivated.

Single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer assays reveal 
heterogeneous folding ensembles in a simple RNA stem-loop.

We have examined the folding ensembles present in solution for a series of RNA 
oligonucleotides that encompass the replicase translational operator stem-loop 
of the RNA bacteriophage MS2. Single-molecule (SM) fluorescence assays suggest 
that these RNAs exist in solution as ensembles of differentially 
base-paired/base-stacked states at equilibrium. There are two distinct ensembles 
for the wild-type sequence, implying the existence of a significant free energy 
barrier between "folded" and "unfolded" ensembles. Experiments with sequence 
variants are consistent with an unfolding mechanism in which interruptions to 
base-paired duplexes, in this example by the single-stranded loop and a 
single-base bulge in the base-paired stem, as well as the free ends, act as 
nucleation points for unfolding. The switch between folded and unfolded 
ensembles is consistent with a transition that occurs when all base-pairing 
and/or base-stacking interactions that would orientate the legs of the RNA stem 
are broken. Strikingly, a U-to-C replacement of a residue in the loop, which 
creates a high-affinity form of the operator for coat protein binding, results 
in dramatically different (un)folding behaviour, revealing distinct 
subpopulations that are either stabilised or destabilised with respect to the 
wild-type sequence. This result suggests additional reasons for selection 
against the C-variant stem-loop in vivo and provides an explanation for the 
increased affinity.

RNA-based therapeutic strategies are used widely due to their highly specific 
mode of action. However, the major obstacle in any RNA-based therapy is cellular 
delivery and stability in the cells. The self-assembly of the MS2 bacteriophage 
capsids has been used to develop virus-like particles (VLPs) for drug delivery. 
In this study, we utilized the heterobifunctional crosslinker, 
sulfosuccinimidyl-4-(p-maleimidophenyl)-butyrate (sulfo-SMPB), to conjugate the 
human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) Tat peptide and MS2 VLPs; the antisense 
RNA against the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) and the internal ribosome entry 
site (IRES) of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) was packaged into these particles by 
using a two-plasmid coexpression system. The MS2 VLPs conjugated with the Tat 
peptide were then transferred into Huh-7 cells containing an HCV reporter 
system. The packaged antisense RNA showed an inhibitory effect on the 
translation of HCV. This paper describes our initial results with this system 
using the Tat peptide.

This article presents analysis and optimization of a microfluidic particle 
filter that uses acoustic radiation forces to remove particles larger than a 
selected size by adjusting the driving conditions of the piezoelectric 
transducer (PZT). Operationally, the acoustic filter concentrates microparticles 
to the center of the microchannel, minimizing undesirable particle adsorption to 
the microchannel walls. Finite element models predict the complex 
two-dimensional acoustic radiation force field perpendicular to the flow 
direction in microfluidic devices. We compare these results with experimental 
parametric studies including variations of the PZT driving frequencies and 
voltages as well as various particle sizes (0.5-5.0 microm in diameter). These 
results provide insight into the optimal operating conditions and show the 
efficacy of our device as a filter with an adjustable effective pore size. We 
demonstrate the separation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae from MS2 bacteriophage 
using our acoustic device. With optimized design of our microfluidic flow 
system, we achieved yields of greater than 90% for the MS2 with greater than 80% 
removal of the S. cerevisiae in this continuous-flow sample preparation device.

Treatability of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency contaminant candidate list 
viruses: removal of coxsackievirus and echovirus using enhanced coagulation.

Enhanced coagulation was evaluated for removal efficacy of coxsackievirus and 
echovirus (Contaminant Candidate List [CCL] enteroviruses), poliovirus, four 
potential surrogate bacteriophages, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Viruses 
and DOC were effectively removed using enhanced coagulation, with removals 
generally improving as dose increased and pH decreased. Optimal enhanced 
coagulation conditions of 40 mg/L FeCl3 and pH between 5 and 6.5 resulted in a 
maximum removal of 3.0 logs of coxsackievirus B6, 1.75 logs of echovirus 12, 2.5 
logs of poliovirus 1, 1.8 logs of fr, 1.3 logs of phi-X174, 0.36 logs of MS2, 
0.29 logs of PRD1, and 41% DOC. Bacteriophages fr and phi-X174 appear to be the 
most representative surrogates for the physical removal of coxsackievirus, while 
MS2 and PRD1 are more conservative. For echovirus, MS2 and PRD1 appearto bethe 
most appropriate surrogates. The relative removal profiles of the enteroviruses 
(greatest removal of coxsackievirus followed by poliovirus and then echovirus) 
suggest that studies of the physical removal of poliovirus may be extended to 
the CCL enteroviruses. These results contribute to evaluations of the CCL and 
regulatory status of coxsackievirus and echovirus and aid in building a database 
of the treatment efficiencies of enteroviruses and their surrogates.

T7 RNA polymerase-mediated incorporation of 8-N(3)AMP into RNA for studying

Ultraviolet (UV)-dependent photochemical crosslinking is a powerful approach 
that can be used for the identification of RNA-protein interactions. Although 
8-azidoATP (8-N(3)ATP) has been widely used to elucidate the ATP binding site of 
a variety of proteins, its inability to serve as an efficient substrate for 
bacteriophage RNA polymerases apparently restricted its actual potential as a 
photocrosslinking agent. In this chapter, in vitro transcription conditions that 
allow for template-dependent incorporation of 8-N(3)AMP into RNA are described. 
In addition, it is shown that a high-affinity MS2 coat protein binding sequence, 
in which adenosine residues were replaced by 8-azidoadenosine, crosslinks to the 
coat protein of the Escherichia coli phage MS2. This approach can be extended to 
identify almost any RNA binding protein.

Deposition kinetics of bacteriophage MS2 on a silica surface coated with natural 
organic matter in a radial stagnation point flow cell.

A quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) coupled with a radial stagnation point flow 
(RSPF) cell was used to study deposition kinetics of bacteriophage MS2 on silica 
surface coated with Suwannee River natural organic matter (SRNOM). Three stocks 
of MS2 stored in 1 mM NaHCO3, deionized (DI) water or phosphate buffer saline 
(PBS) solution were studied. MS2 stored in PBS solution were found to aggregate 
at all studied ionic strengths from 3 mM to 200 mM, while MS2 stored in DI water 
and bicarbonate solutions remained monodispersed. Isoelectric points of MS2 
storedin PBS solution were lower than for those stored in DI water and 1 mM 
NaHCO3 solution. Nonrepulsive deposition rates of MS2 on silica surface coated 
with poly-L-lysine (PLL) were independent of ionic strength. In contrast MS2 
deposition rates on bare silica surface or silica surface coated with SRNOM 
increased gradually and stabilized at an ionic strength of 60 mM. MS2 deposition 
rates on bare silica surface were higher than those on silica surface coated 
with SRNOM at low ionic strengths. Deposition rates on these two surfaces were 
similar at high ionic strengths. Experimental data suggest that electrostatic 
and steric interactions were the two main deposition mechanisms of MS2 on either 
bare silica or silica surface coated with SRNOM.

A phage RNA-binding protein binds to a non-cognate structured RNA and stabilizes

Recent studies suggest that some RNA-binding proteins facilitate the folding of 
non-cognate RNAs. Here, we report that bacteriophage MS2 coat protein (MS2 CP) 
bound and promoted the catalytic activity of Candida group I ribozyme. Cloning 
of the MS2-bound RNA segments showed that this protein primarily interacts with 
the P5ab-P5 structure. Ultraviolet cross-linking and the T1 footprinting assay 
further showed that MS2 binding stabilized tertiary interactions, including the 
conserved L9-P5 interaction, and led to a more compact core structure. This 
mechanism is similar to that of the yeast mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase 
on other group I introns, suggesting that different RNA-binding proteins may use 
common mechanisms to support RNA structures.

The filtration of phi X 174, MS2, and T4 bacteriophages out of tap water and 
secondary effluents was performed by rapid sand filtration. The viruses were 
characterized, and the influence of their microscopic characteristics on 
filterability was examined by comparing retention values, residence times, 
attachment, and dispersion coefficients calculated from an advection-dispersion 
model and residence time variation. The only factor observed to influence 
retention was virus size, such that the larger the virus, the better the 
retention. The difference was due to the more effective transport of viruses 
inside the media, an observation that runs counter to currently accepted 
filtration theory. Cake formation on top of the filter during the initial stages 
of secondary effluent filtration significantly increased headloss, eventually 
resulting in shorter filtration cycles. However, deep filters contain buffering 
zones where the pressure drop is amortized, thus allowing for continued 
filtration. After the effluent passed through the buffer zone, regular 
filtration was observed, during which considerable virus retention was achieved.

Differences in the behaviors of two surrogates for pathogenic waterborne 
viruses, F-specific RNA bacteriophages Qbeta and MS2, were investigated during 
the coagulation process by using river water spiked with these bacteriophages. 
The particle size and electrophoretic mobility of Qbeta and MS2 were similar, 
but the removal performances of infectious Qbeta and MS2, as measured by a 
plaque forming unit (PFU) method, differed markedly during the coagulation 
process. The removal ratio of the infectious Qbeta concentration was 
approximately 2log higher than that of the infectious MS2 concentration at all 
coagulant doses tested. The total Qbeta and MS2 bacteriophage concentrations, 
which were measured by a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain 
reaction (RT-PCR) method and represented the total number of bacteriophages 
regardless of their infectivity, were similar after the coagulation process, 
suggesting that the behaviors of Qbeta and MS2 as particles were similar during 
the coagulation process. The difference between total concentration and 
infectious concentration indicated that some of the bacteriophages were probably 
inactivated during the coagulation process. This difference was larger for Qbeta 
than MS2, meaning that Qbeta was more sensitive to the virucidal activity of the 
aluminum coagulant. Analysis of the PFU and real-time RT-PCR findings together 
suggested that the difference in removal performances of Qbeta and MS2 during 
the coagulation process was probably caused by differences not in the extent of 
bacteriophage entrapment in the aluminum floc particles but in the sensitivity 
to virucidal activity of the aluminum coagulant.

Virus analysis using electromigration techniques.

We discuss the progress during the last 4 years in the analysis of viruses by 
electrophoresis in capillaries and microfluidic devices. The paper is the 
continuation of a review published in this journal in 2005 [Kremser, L., Blaas, 
D., Kenndler, E., Electrophoresis 2004, 25, 2282-2291]. Eighteen papers on the 
topic have appeared since; the majority deals with zone electrophoresis and 
three reports are on IEF. These methods have been applied to human rhinoviruses, 
poliovirus Semliki Forest virus, norovirus-like particles, and the two 
bacteriophages MS2 and T5. A main finding was that addition of detergents and 
salts to the BGEs are essential for the robustness of the CE analysis. Analyte 
detection was usually via UV absorbance but there are some examples where the 
viruses were rendered fluorescent via modification of the capsid proteins with 
reactive dyes and/or by non-covalent attachment of intercalating fluorescent 
compounds to the nucleic acids making up the viral genome. Interestingly, some 
viruses are permeable to small molecular mass components; this allows 
fluorescent dyes to diffuse into the intact virus where they attach to the 
nucleic acid. Release of a viral genome upon heating was also monitored by using 
similar methodologies. Interactions of viruses and subviral particles with 
antibodies, receptors, and receptor-decorated liposomes were investigated with 
CE methods, all by using a non-equilibrium approach (i.e. co-incubation of the 
components prior to CE separation). Viruses are multivalent (i.e. possess many 
identical surface-exposed patches) and most of them are composed of defined 
numbers of identical subunits. The high resolution of CE has been most 
remarkably demonstrated by the separation of stoichiometric complexes between 
virus and a distinct number of soluble recombinant receptors and revealed their 
concentration-dependent distribution.

Approximately 15% of overall Australian household water usage is in the laundry; 
hence, a significant reduction in household drinking water demand could be 
achieved if potable-quality water used for clothes washing is replaced with 
recycled water. To investigate the microbiological safety of using recycled 
water in washing machines, bacteriophages MS-2 and PRD-1, Escherichia coli, and 
Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts were used in a series of experiments to 
investigate the transfer efficiency of enteric microorganisms from washing 
machine water to objects including hands, environmental surfaces, air, and 
fabric swatches. By determining the transference efficiency, it is possible to 
estimate the numbers of microorganisms that the user will be exposed to if 
recycled water with various levels of residual microorganisms is used in washing 
machines. Results, expressed as transfer rates to a given surface area per 
object, showed that the mean transfer efficiency of E. coli, bacteriophages MS-2 
and PRD-1, and C. parvum oocysts from seeded water to fabric swatches ranged 
from 0.001% to 0.090%. Greatest exposure to microorganisms occurred through 
direct contact of hands with seeded water and via hand contact with contaminated 
fabric swatches. No microorganisms were detected in the air samples during the 
washing machine spin cycle, and transfer rates of bacteriophages from water to 
environmental surfaces were 100-fold less than from water directly to hands. 
Findings from this study provide relevant information that can be used to refine 
regulations governing recycled water and to allay public concerns about the use 
of recycled water.

Development of a test system to apply virus-containing particles to filtering 
facepiece respirators for the evaluation of decontamination procedures.

A chamber to apply aerosolized virus-containing particles to air-permeable 
substrates (coupons) was constructed and validated as part of a method to assess 
the virucidal efficacy of decontamination procedures for filtering facepiece 
respirators. Coliphage MS2 was used as a surrogate for pathogenic viruses for 
confirmation of the efficacy of the bioaerosol respirator test system. The 
distribution of virus applied onto and within the coupons was characterized, and 
the repeatability of applying a targeted virus load was examined. The average 
viable virus loaded onto 90 coupons over the course of 5 days was found to be 
5.09 +/- 0.19 log(10) PFU/coupon (relative standard deviation, 4%). To determine 
the ability to differentiate the effectiveness of disinfecting procedures with 
different levels of performance, sodium hypochlorite and steam treatments were 
tested in experiments by varying the dose and time, respectively. The role of 
protective factors was assessed by aerosolizing the virus with various 
concentrations of the aerosol-generating medium. A sodium hypochlorite (bleach) 
concentration of 0.6% and steam treatments of 45 s and longer resulted in log 
reductions (>4 logs) which reached the detection limits for both levels of 
protective factors. Organic matter (ATCC medium 271) as a protective factor 
afforded some protection to the virus in the sodium hypochlorite experiments but 
was not a factor in the steam experiments. The evaluation of the bioaerosol 
respirator test system demonstrated a repeatable method for applying a targeted 
viral load onto respirator coupons and provided insight into the properties of 
aerosols that are of importance to the development of disinfection assays for 
air-permeable materials.

Analysis of the survival of Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus and 
possible viral simulants in liquid suspensions.

Clinical Sciences Branch, Bethesda, MD, USA.

AIMS: To compare the inactivation rate of Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis 
(VEE) virus in liquids to that of Sindbis virus (SV, another alphavirus) and to 
a bacteriophage (MS2) generally used as a viral simulant in the development of 
countermeasures in biodefense.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Viruses were inoculated into liquids and viral titres were 
determined at various times postinoculation. The viruses were stable in 
distilled-deionized (dd) water at 4 degrees C during the 21 days of the study. 
The inactivation rates of VEE and SV in dd water at 21 and 30 degrees C were 
very similar (between 0.12 and 0.14 log(10) per day), while MS2 was three-fold 
slower. In tap water (chlorine content between 4 and 5 ppm) at 21 degrees C, VEE 
and SV were inactivated at twice the rate measured in dd water.
CONCLUSIONS: The inactivation rates of VEE and SV were similar to each other and 
faster than MS2 in all liquids tested.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: VEE is likely to remain viable for many 
days after release into water, snow, or even chlorinated tap water. SV can be 
used to estimate the persistence of VEE in liquids, but using MS2 as a simulant 
would overestimate of the stability of VEE.

Here we describe a new DNA capture element (DCE) sensing system, based on the 
quenching and dequenching of a double-stranded aptamer. This system shows very 
good sensitivity and thermal stability. While quenching, dequenching, and 
separating the DCE systems made from different aptamers (all selected by SELEX), 
an alternative method to rapidly select aptamers was developed-the Aptamer 
Selection Express (ASExp). This process has been used to select aptamers against 
different types of targets (Bacillus anthracis spores, Bacillus thuringiensis 
spores, MS-2 bacteriophage, ovalbumin, and botulinum neurotoxin). The DCE 
systems made from botulinum neurotoxin aptamers selected by ASExp have been 
investigated. The results of this investigation indicate that ASExp can be used 
to rapidly select aptamers for the DCE sensing system.

    Risk Anal. 2017 Aug;37(8):1628.

Existing microbial risk assessment models rarely incorporate detailed 
descriptions of human interaction with fomites. We develop a 
stochastic-mechanistic model of exposure to rotavirus from nondietary ingestion 
iterated by simulated intermittent fomes-mouth, hand-mouth, and hand-fomes 
contacts typical of a child under six years of age. This exposure is 
subsequently translated to risk using a simple static dose-response 
relationship. Through laboratory experiments, we quantified the mean rate of 
inactivation for MS2 phage on glass (0.0052/hr) and mean transfer between 
fingertips and glass (36%). Simulations using these parameters demonstrated that 
a child's ingested dose from a rotavirus-contaminated ball ranges from 2 to 
1,000 virus over a period of one hour, with a median value of 42 virus. These 
results were heavily influenced by selected values of model parameters, most 
notably the concentration of rotavirus on fomes, frequency of fomes-mouth 
contacts, frequency of hand-mouth contacts, and virus transferred from fomes to 
mouth. The model demonstrated that mouthing of fomes is the primary exposure 
route, with hand mouthing contributions accounting for less than one-fifth of 
the child's dose over the first 10 minutes of interaction.

RNA bacteriophage MS2.

USA. abetanco@staffmail.ed.ac.uk

Experimental evolution of bacteriophage provides a powerful means of studying 
the genetics of adaptation, as every substitution contributing to adaptation can 
be identified and characterized. Here, I use experimental evolution of MS2, an 
RNA bacteriophage, to study its adaptive response to a novel environment. To 
this end, three lines of MS2 were adapted to rapid growth and lysis at cold 
temperature for a minimum of 50 phage generations and subjected to whole-genome 
sequencing. Using this system, I identified adaptive substitutions, monitored 
changes in frequency of adaptive mutations through the course of the experiment, 
and measured the effect on phage growth rate of each substitution. All three 
lines showed a substantial increase in fitness (a two- to threefold increase in 
growth rate) due to a modest number of substitutions (three to four). The data 
show some evidence that the substitutions occurring early in the experiment have 
larger beneficial effects than later ones, in accordance with the expected 
diminishing returns relationship between the fitness effects of a mutation and 
its order of substitution. Patterns of molecular evolution seen here--primarily 
a paucity of hitchhiking mutations--suggest an abundant supply of beneficial 
mutations in this system. Nevertheless, some beneficial mutations appear to have 
been lost, possibly due to accumulation of beneficial mutations on other genetic 
backgrounds, clonal interference, and negatively epistatic interactions with 
other beneficial mutations.

AIMS: To determine the efficiency of various ultrafiltration cartridges (UFC) in 
concentrating test micro-organisms from drinking water.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Replicate drinking water samples from three potable water 
supplies were dosed with Bacillus anthracis Sterne, Francisella tularensis LVS, 
Yersinia pestis CO92, bacteriophages MS2 and phi-X174, and Cryptosporidium 
parvum. The test micro-organisms were dosed together in 100 l of water, which 
was then recirculated through one of five different UFC until the retentate 
volume was reduced to c. 500 ml. The micro-organisms were assayed before and 
after ultrafiltration concentration and per cent recoveries were calculated. 
There were nine statistically significant differences among pairs of filters out 
of a possible 180 different combinations of UFC, test micro-organisms, and water 
types.
CONCLUSIONS: No filter consistently performed better or worse than the others 
for each test micro-organism in all water samples tested.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study provides performance data on 
the ability of several different UFC to concentrate a panel of test 
micro-organisms from three sources of potable water. Water utilities and first 
responders may use these data when selecting UFC for use in emergency response 
protocols. This study also provides additional data as to the efficacy of 
ultrafiltration for recovering bacteria, virus-like particles, and protozoan 
oocysts from water samples.

Chlorine inactivation of coliphage MS2 on strawberries by industrial-scale water 
washing units.

Fruits and vegetables (produce) intended for minimal processing are often rinsed 
or washed in water. Chlorine and other sanitizers are used during washing to 
inactivate produce spoilage microbes, but such procedures may also inactivate 
pathogens epidemiologically linked to produce, such as hepatitis A virus (HAV). 
However, no information exists on the efficacy of chlorinated wash water to 
inactivate HAV and other viruses on produce in actual practice, because of 
obvious safety concerns. In contrast, coliphage MS2 (a bacterial virus) is 
commonly used as a surrogate for some pathogenic viruses and may be safely used 
in field studies. In the present investigation, strawberries seeded with MS2 
were passed through industrial-scale water washing units operated with or 
without added sodium hypochlorite. MS2 on strawberries was inactivated by 68%, 
92% and 96% at free chlorine (FC) concentrations of < or = 2, 20 and 200 ppm in 
wash water, respectively. MS2 was detected in wash water containing < or = 2 ppm 
FC in one trial, but was not detected in water containing 20 or 200 ppm FC. The 
presence and absence of MS2 in wash water containing various levels of FC 
highlight the importance of controlling sanitizer levels to prevent viral cross 
contamination of strawberries.

Hollow-fiber ultrafiltration (UF) is a technique that is increasingly viewed as 
an effective alternative for simultaneously recovering diverse microbes (e.g., 
viruses, bacteria, parasites) from large volumes of drinking water. The USEPA 
has organism-specific methods, including Method 1623 for Cryptosporidium and 
Giardia and the virus adsorption-elution (VIRADEL) technique using 1MDS 
electropositive filters. In this study, we directly compare the performance of a 
previously published UF method to that of the USEPA Method 1623 (for recovering 
Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia intestinalis) and the 1MDS VIRADEL method 
(for bacteriophages and echovirus) using 100-L dechlorinated tap water samples. 
The UF method produced significantly higher recoveries of C. parvum versus 
Method 1623 (83% mean recovery for UF versus 46% mean recovery for Method 1623), 
while recoveries for G. intestinalis were similar for both methods. Results of 
the virus method comparison showed the UF method (including secondary 
concentration using microconcentrators) to be very effective for the recovery of 
echovirus 1, bacteriophage MS2, and bacteriophage phi X174, with mean recovery 
efficiencies of 58, 100, and 77%, respectively. The VIRADEL technique (including 
secondary concentration by organic flocculation) recovered significantly less 
echovirus 1, and the bacteriophages could not be quantified by the method due to 
phage inactivation and/or assay inhibition. The results of this study 
demonstrate that the UF technique can be as effective, or more effective, than 
established USEPA methods for recovery of viruses and protozoan parasites from 
100-L tap water samples.

Escherichia coli mRNA interferases, such as MazF and ChpBK, are 
sequence-specific endoribonucleases encoded by toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems 
present in its genome. A MazF homologue in Staphylococcus aureus (MazF(Sa)) has 
been shown to inhibit cell growth when induced in E. coli. Here, we determined 
the cleavage site for MazF(Sa) with the use of phage MS2 RNA as a substrate and 
CspA, an RNA chaperone, which prevents the formation of secondary structures in 
the RNA substrate. MazF(Sa) specifically cleaves the RNA at a pentad sequence, U 
downward arrow ACAU. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that this pentad sequence 
is significantly abundant in several genes, including the sraP gene in the S. 
aureus N315 strain. This gene encodes a serine-rich protein, which is known to 
play an important role in adhesion of the pathogen to human tissues and thus in 
endovascular infection. We demonstrated that the sraP mRNA became extremely 
unstable in comparison with the ompA mRNA only when MazF(Sa) was induced in E. 
coli. Further bioinformatics analysis indicated that the pentad sequence is also 
significantly abundant in the mRNAs for all the pathogenic factors in S. aureus. 
This observation suggests a possible regulatory relationship between the 
MazEF(Sa) TA module and the pathogenicity in S. aureus.

Generation of nonagglomerated airborne bacteriophage particles using an 
electrospray technique.

Technology, Hawolgok-dong, Seoul 136-791, Republic of Korea.

Biological electrospray techniques are rapidly becoming a promising means for 
controlling living organisms in applications ranging from mass spectrometry to 
developmental biology. We investigated the generation characteristics of 
airborne MS2 bacteriophage particles <30 nm in size, using an electrospray 
technique. A suspension containing bacteriophage MS2 was sprayed in cone-jet 
mode using a specially designed electrospray system with a 
point-to-orifice-plate configuration mentioned in previous studies based on a 
charge reduced electrospray size spectrometry. The highly charged droplets were 
discharged rapidly into a radioactive neutralizer of Po(210). The electrosprayed 
airborne MS2 particles (23.8 +/- 0.49 nm GMD) maintained their monodisperse size 
distribution with good stability and uniformity for >1 h. Compared with the 
generation characteristics observed using the previous nebulization process 
(51.5 +/- 0.86 nm GMD), this electrospray technique produced nonagglomerated 
particles, resulting in a narrow size range of generated particles. The total 
MS2 particle number concentration and GMD increased with changes in the 
suspension flow rate from 5 to 25 microL/h. As the applied voltage increased in 
cone-jet mode, the GMD and culturable bacteriophage concentration decreased 
slightly. Our investigation shows that the electrospray process, driven by 
high-intensity electric fields, can be used for nanometer-sized living 
organisms.

Author information:
(1)School of Environmental Sciences, Mahatma Gandhi University, Kerala, India.

AIMS: The survival of Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, 
Enterococcus faecalis and coliphage MS2 was studied in stored, fresh and diluted 
(1 : 1) human urine at 15 and 30 degrees C.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Survival rate was studied by the plate count method. All 
the organisms showed rapid inactivation in stored urine, but they survived 
better in diluted and fresh urine. The high pH level and temperature were the 
major factors found to influence the survival of the micro-organisms with the 
survival rate being higher at 15 degrees C than at 30 degrees C.
CONCLUSIONS: The destruction of all micro-organisms in stored urine required <1 
week at 30 degrees C. Thus, the storage of urine is a useful way to reduce the 
risk of contamination while using urine as a fertilizer.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The urine fertilization is aimed for the 
developing countries and the high temperatures in these countries may hasten the 
destruction of micro-organisms in urine. On the contrary, a higher survival rate 
of these organisms in fresh and diluted urine is a public health concern because 
the dilution of urine with water is likely to happen during flushing.

Ceramic materials that can adsorb and/or inactivate viruses in water may find 
widespread application in low-tech drinking-water treatment technologies in 
developing countries, where porous ceramic filters and ceramic granular media 
filters are increasingly promoted for that purpose. We examined the adsorption 
and subsequent inactivation of bacteriophages MS2 and (phiX-174 on five ceramic 
media in batch adsorption studies to determine media suitability for use in a 
ceramic water filter application. The media examined were a kaolinitic ceramic 
medium and four kaolinitic ceramic media amended with iron or aluminium oxides 
that had been incorporated into the kaolinitic clays before firing. Batch 
adsorption tests indicate increased sorption and inactivation of surrogate 
viruses by media amended with Fe and Al oxide, with FeOOH-amended ceramic 
inactivating all bacteriophages up to 8 log10. Unmodified ceramic was a poor 
adsorbent of bacteriophages at less than 1 log10 adsorption-inactivation and 
high recovery of sorbed phages. These studies suggest that contact with ceramic 
media, modified with electropositive Fe or Al oxides, can reduce bacteriophages 
in waters to a greater extent than unmodified ceramic.

human immunodeficiency virus type 1.

The branched DNA (bDNA) assay is a reliable method for quantifying the RNA of 
human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The positive controls and standards 
for this assay for the detection of HIV-1 consist of naked RNA, which is 
susceptible to degradation by RNase. Armored RNA is a good candidate for an 
RNase-resistant positive control or standard. However, its use has been limited 
by the maximal length of the exogenous RNA packaged into virus-like particles by 
routine armored RNA technology. In the present study, we produced armored long 
RNA (armored L-RNA) controls or standards (AR-HIV-pol-3034b) for a bDNA assay of 
HIV-1 by increasing the amount and affinity of the pac sites (the pac site is a 
specific 19-nucleotide stem-loop region located at the 5' terminus of the MS2 
bacteriophage replicase gene) by a one-plasmid double-expression system. 
AR-HIV-pol-3034b was completely resistant to DNase and RNase, was stable in 
normal human EDTA-preserved plasma at 4 degrees C for at least 6 months, and 
produced reproducible, linear results in the Versant HIV-1 RNA 3.0 assay. In 
conclusion, AR-HIV-pol-3034b could act as a positive control or standard in a 
bDNA assay for the detection of HIV-1. In addition, the one-plasmid 
double-expression system can be used as a better platform than the one-plasmid 
expression system and the two-plasmid coexpression system for expressing armored 
L-RNA.

bacteriophage aerosols.

AIMS: To investigate the performance of an iodine-releasing filter medium for 
use as a protective device against airborne pathogens.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The filter's physical and viable removal efficiencies (VRE) 
were investigated with challenges of MS2 bacteriophage aerosols, and the 
infectivity of MS2 collected on the filter was analysed. To test a proposed 
inactivation mechanism, media containing thiosulfate or bovine serum albumin 
(BSA) were put in impingers to quench and consume I(2) released from the filter. 
In direct plating experiments, treated filters presented significantly higher 
VREs than did untreated filters; however, collection in excess BSA decreased VRE 
by half and in thiosulfate the apparent VRE decreased drastically. No 
significant difference in infectivity of retained viruses on treated and 
untreated filters was observed at the same environmental condition.
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence presented herein for competition by dissolved I(2) in 
infectivity assays supports a mechanism of induced displacement and capture of 
I(2.) It also requires that dissociation of iodine from the filter and capture 
of iodine by MS2 aerosols as they pass through the filter be factored in the 
design of the assessment methodology. The filter's strong retention capability 
minimizes reaerosolization but also makes it difficult to discriminate the 
antimicrobial effect at the surface.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study shows the direct plating assay 
method to be sensitive to interference by iodine-releasing materials. This 
requires reevaluation of earlier reports of VRE measurements.

Particles formed by the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein mutants with insertions 
in their surface loops induce a strong immune response against the inserted 
epitopes. The covalent dimers created by fusion of two copies of the coat 
protein gene are more tolerant to various insertions into the surface loops than 
the single subunits. We determined a 4.7-A resolution crystal structure of an 
icosahedral particle assembled from covalent dimers and compared its stability 
with wild-type virions. The structure resembled the wild-type virion except for 
the intersubunit linker regions. The covalent dimer orientation was random with 
respect to both icosahedral twofold and quasi-twofold symmetry axes. A fraction 
of the particles was unstable in phosphate buffer because of assembly defects. 
Our results provide a structural background for design of modified covalent coat 
protein dimer subunits for use in immunization.

Virus reference materials are needed to develop and calibrate detection devices 
and instruments. We used electrospray differential mobility analysis (ES-DMA) 
and quantitative amino acid analysis (AAA) to determine the particle 
concentration of three small model viruses (bacteriophages MS2, PP7, and 
phiX174). The biological activity, purity, and aggregation of the virus samples 
were measured using plaque assays, denaturing gel electrophoresis, and 
size-exclusion chromatography. ES-DMA was developed to count the virus particles 
using gold nanoparticles as internal standards. ES-DMA additionally provides 
quantitative measurement of the size and extent of aggregation in the virus 
samples. Quantitative AAA was also used to determine the mass of the viral 
proteins in the pure virus samples. The samples were hydrolyzed and the masses 
of the well-recovered amino acids were used to calculate the equivalent 
concentration of viral particles in the samples. The concentration of the virus 
samples determined by ES-DMA was in good agreement with the concentration 
predicted by AAA for these purified samples. The advantages and limitations of 
ES-DMA and AAA to characterize virus reference materials are discussed.

field experiments and large intact soil cores.

Information about the microbial removal efficiencies of subsurface media is 
essential for assessing the risk of water contamination, estimating setback 
distances between disposal fields and receiving waters, and selecting suitable 
sites for wastewater reclamation. By analyzing published data from field 
experiments and large intact soil cores, an extensive database of microbial 
removal rates was established for a wide range of subsurface media. High 
microbial removal rates were found in volcanic soils, pumice sand, fine sand, 
and highly weathered aquifer rocks. Low removal rates were found in structured 
clayey soils, stony soils, coarse gravel aquifers, fractured rocks, and karst 
limestones. Removal rates were lower for enteroviruses than for other human 
viruses; for MS2 phage than for other phage species; for waste-associated 
microbes than for those cultivated in the laboratory; and for contaminated media 
than for uncontaminated media. Microbial removal rates are inversely correlated 
with infiltration rates and transport velocity. The assumption of first-order 
law, or a constant removal rate (when the transport scale reaches a 
representative elementary volume), is appropriate for most of field data 
analyzed. However 30% of the datasets (26 out of 87 pairs) are better described 
with the power law, implying reduced removal rates with transport distance. The 
latter is most prominent for organically contaminated media, especially in 
relatively fine aquifer media. The presence of organic matter, heterogeneity in 
microbial properties, change in solution chemistry, detachment, and physical 
straining, may have caused the discrepancies from the first-order law 
traditionally used in transport models for describing microbial removal.

We present a rapid method for the identification of viruses using microfluidic 
chip gel electrophoresis (CGE) of high-copy number proteins to generate unique 
protein profiles. Viral proteins are solubilized by heating at 95 degrees C in 
borate buffer containing detergent (5 min), then labeled with fluorescamine dye 
(10 s), and analyzed using the microChemLab CGE system (5 min). Analyses of 
closely related T2 and T4 bacteriophage demonstrate sufficient assay sensitivity 
and peak resolution to distinguish the two phage. CGE analyses of four 
additional viruses--MS2 bacteriophage, Epstein-Barr, respiratory syncytial, and 
vaccinia viruses--demonstrate reproducible and visually distinct protein 
profiles. To evaluate the suitability of the method for unique identification of 
viruses, we employed a Bayesian classification approach. Using a subset of 126 
replicate electropherograms of the six viruses and phage for training purposes, 
successful classification with non-training data was 66/69 or 95% with no false 
positives. The classification method is based on a single attribute (elution 
time), although other attributes such as peak width, peak amplitude, or peak 
shape could be incorporated and may improve performance further. The encouraging 
results suggest a rapid and simple way to identify viruses without requiring 
specialty reagents such as PCR probes and antibodies.

Enteric viruses such as norovirus (NV) and hepatitis A (HAV) are responsible for 
a large proportion of food and water-borne illnesses. Most human pathogenic 
enteric viruses cannot be cultured so they must be detected by molecular 
techniques. Male specific (F(+)) RNA coliphages, a potential surrogate for human 
enteric viruses, can be detected by culture and molecular assays. Numbers of 
viruses and F-RNA coliphages in contaminated food or water may be too low for 
direct detection. Ultrafiltration is a general concentration method for all 
virus types but there is little information on the recovery efficiency of F-RNA 
coliphages and enteric viruses. The recovery of F-RNA coliphage MS2 was only 25% 
by plaque assay in initial trials. The objective was to optimize the recovery of 
concentrated MS2 from Microsep 100K ultrafiltration devices. The mean recovery 
of MS2 increased significantly to 85% by plaque assay and 65% by real-time 
RT-PCR when ultrafiltration devices were treated with 1% BSA before 
concentration and then ultrasonicated after concentration. The method was 
validated with MS2, HAV, NV and feline calicivirus (FCV) in water and spinach 
eluate. The recovery of MS2, HAV and NV was significantly higher from 
concentrates obtained from water with treated devices than untreated devices but 
not significantly different for FCV or from spinach eluate. To our knowledge, 
this is the first study to use ultrasonication as a post-treatment step to 
increase recovery of viruses from ultrafiltration devices.

Dead-end ultrafiltration (DEUF) is an alternative approach to tangential-flow 
hollow-fiber ultrafiltration that can be readily employed under field conditions 
to recover microbes from water. The hydraulics of DEUF and microbe recovery for 
a new DEUF method were investigated using 100-liter tap water samples. Pressure, 
flow rate, and temperature were investigated using four hollow-fiber ultrafilter 
types. Based on hydraulic performance, the Asahi Kasei REXEED 25S ultrafilter 
was selected for microbe recovery experiments. Microbe recovery experiments were 
performed using MS2 bacteriophage, Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium 
perfringens spores, and Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts. Microbes were recovered 
from ultrafilters by backflushing using a surfactant solution. Average flow 
rates were 2.1 liters/min for 100-liter water samples having turbidities of 0.28 
to 4.3 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU), and no evidence of appreciable 
filter clogging was observed. The DEUF average recovery efficiencies for each 
study analyte in tap water were as follows: for E. faecalis, 93% +/- 16%; for 
MS2, 57% +/- 7.7%; for C. perfringens spores, 94% +/- 22%; and for C. parvum, 
87% +/- 18%. Average microbe recoveries for tap water amended with surface water 
(average turbidity = 4.3 NTU) were as follows: for E. faecalis, 78% +/- 12%; for 
MS2, 73% +/- 13%; for C. perfringens, 57% +/- 21%; and for C. parvum, 83% +/- 
21%. These data demonstrate that DEUF is an effective method for recovering 
diverse microbes from water and should be a useful tool for field-based 
environmental investigations.

Beach sand contains fecal indicator bacteria, often in densities greatly 
exceeding the adjacent swimming waters. We examined the transferability of 
Escherichia coli and F+ coliphage (MS2) from beach sand to hands in order to 
estimate the potential subsequent health risk. Sand with high initial E. coli 
concentrations was collected from a Chicago beach. Individuals manipulated the 
sand for 60 seconds, and rinse water was analysed for E. coli and coliphage. E. 
coli densities transferred were correlated with density in sand rather than 
surface area of an individual's hand, and the amount of coliphage transferred 
from seeded sand was different among individuals. In sequential rinsing, 
percentage reduction was 92% for E. coli and 98% for coliphage. Using 
dose-response estimates developed for swimming water, it was determined that the 
number of individuals per thousand that would develop gastrointestinal symptoms 
would be 11 if all E. coli on the fingertip were ingested or 33 if all E. coli 
on the hand were ingested. These results suggest that beach sand may be an 
important medium for microbial exposure; bacteria transfer is related to initial 
concentration in the sand; and rinsing may be effective in limiting oral 
exposure to sand-borne microbes of human concern.

Quantitative PCR for determining the infectivity of bacteriophage MS2 upon 
inactivation by heat, UV-B radiation, and singlet oxygen: advantages and 
limitations of an enzymatic treatment to reduce false-positive results.

de Lausanne, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland. bmpecson@gmail.com

Health risks posed by waterborne viruses are difficult to assess because it is 
tedious or impossible to determine the infectivity of many viruses. Recent 
studies hypothesized that quantitative PCR (qPCR) could selectively quantify 
infective viruses if preceded by an enzymatic treatment (ET) to reduce 
confounding false-positive signals. The goal of this study was to determine if 
ET with qPCR (ET-qPCR) can be used to accurately quantify the infectivity of the 
human viral surrogate bacteriophage MS2 upon partial inactivation by three 
treatments (heating at 72 degrees C, singlet oxygen, and UV radiation). Viruses 
were inactivated in buffered solutions and a lake water sample and assayed with 
culturing, qPCR, and ET-qPCR. To ensure that inactivating genome damage was 
fully captured, primer sets that covered the entire coding region were used. The 
susceptibility of different genome regions and the maximum genomic damage after 
each inactivating treatment were compared. We found that (i) qPCR alone caused 
false-positive results for all treatments, (ii) ET-qPCR significantly reduced 
(up to >5.2 log units) but did not eliminate the false-positive signals, and 
(iii) the elimination of false-positive signals differed between inactivating 
treatments. By assaying the whole coding region, we demonstrated that genome 
damage only partially accounts for virus inactivation. The possibility of 
achieving complete accordance between culture- and PCR-based assays is therefore 
called into doubt. Despite these differences, we postulate that ET-qPCR can 
track infectivity, given that decreases in infectivity were always accompanied 
by dose-dependent decreases in ET-qPCR signal. By decreasing false-positive 
signals, ET-qPCR improved the detection of infectivity loss relative to qPCR.

divalent cations.

The role of divalent cations (i.e. Ca(2+) and Mg(2+)) in the deposition kinetics 
of the bacteriophage MS2 onto flat bare silica surfaces and Suwannee River 
Natural Organic Matter (SRNOM)-coated silica surfaces was investigated using a 
Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) coupled with a radial stagnation point flow 
(RSPF) system. Experimental results demonstrated that attachment efficiencies of 
MS2 onto the SRNOM surface were seven to seventeen times higher in the presence 
of Ca(2+) than in the presence of Mg(2+). A similar trend was observed for the 
adsorption of polyglutamic acid, which is one of the carboxylate-containing 
amino acid residues found on the surface of MS2 capsids present on SRNOM-coated 
surfaces. The difference in attachment rates in a solution containing either 
Ca(2+) or Mg(2+) can be explained by a stronger tendency of Ca(2+) compared to 
Mg(2+) to form cation bridges by binding to carboxylate groups of both the SRNOM 
and the MS2 capsids. Moreover, higher attachment efficiencies of MS2 onto the 
SRNOM-coated silica surfaces compared to those on bare silica surfaces in the 
presence of either Ca(2+) or Mg(2+) at concentrations higher than 0.3 mM 
emphasized the important role of SRNOM carboxylate groups. Experimental data 
also showed reduced attachment efficiency of MS2 to SRNOM-coated surfaces in 
solution containing 1 mg/L SRNOM.

A long-standing question in retrovirus biology is how RNA genomes are 
distributed among virions. In the studies presented in this report, we addressed 
this issue by directly examining HIV-1 RNAs in virions using a modified HIV-1 
genome that contained recognition sites for BglG, an antitermination protein in 
the Escherichia coli bgl operon, which was coexpressed with a fragment of BglG 
RNA binding protein fused to a fluorescent protein. Our results demonstrate that 
the majority of virions (>90%) contain viral RNAs. We also coexpressed HIV-1 
genomes containing binding sites for BglG or the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein 
along with 2 fluorescent protein-tagged RNA binding proteins. This method allows 
simultaneously labeling and discrimination of 2 different RNAs at 
single-RNA-detection sensitivity. Using this strategy, we obtained physical 
evidence that virions contain RNAs derived from different parental viruses 
(heterozygous virion) at ratios expected from a random distribution, and we 
found that this ratio can be altered by changing the dimerization sequences. Our 
studies of heterozygous virions also support a generally accepted but unproven 
assumption that most particles contain 1 dimer. This study provides answers to 
long-standing questions in HIV-1 biology and illustrates the power and 
sensitivity of the 2-RNA labeling method, which can also be adapted to analyze 
various issues of RNA biogenesis including the detection of different RNAs in 
live cell imaging.

Laser-induced fluorescence is used to investigate fluorescence properties of 
unwashed Bacillus thuringiensis and Bacillus subtilis spores, ovalbumin, and 
washed bacteriophage MS2. A fluorescence detector is calibrated to obtain 
absolute fluorescence cross sections. Fluorescence maps of biological aerosols 
and suspensions are measured at a wide excitation range from 210 to 419 nm and a 
wide detection range from 315 to 650 nm. The dominant features of the measured 
spectra are the amino acid peaks, having excitation maxima at 220 and 280 nm. 
The peaks are similar for the bacterial spores, both for aerosols and 
suspensions, whereas the peaks are shifted toward the shorter emission 
wavelengths for the suspended ovalbumin and MS2. Moreover, the fluorescence 
emission, excited above 320 nm is more intensive for the aerosols than the 
suspensions.

Airborne virus capture and inactivation were studied in an electrostatic 
precipitator (ESP) at applied voltages from -10 to +10 kV using aerosolized 
bacteriophages T3 and MS2. For each charging scenario, samples were collected 
from the effluent air stream and assayed for viable phages using plaque assays 
and for nucleic acids using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) 
assays. At higher applied voltages, more virus particles were captured from air 
with maximum log reductions of 6.8 and 6.3 for the plaque assay and 4.2 and 3.5 
for the qPCR assay at -10 kV for T3 and MS2, respectively. Beyond corona 
inception (i.e., at applied voltages of -10, -8, +8, and +10 kV), log reduction 
values obtained with the plaque assay were much higher compared to those of the 
qPCR assay because nonviable particles, while present in the effluent were 
unaccounted for in the plaque assay. Comparisons of these assays showed that 
in-flight inactivation (i.e., inactivation without capture) was greater for the 
highest applied voltages with a log inactivation of 2.6 for both phages at -10 
kV. We have demonstrated great potential for virus capture and inactivation via 
continual ion and reactive species bombardment when conditions in the ESP are 
enforced to generate a corona discharge.

systems.

Four novel hexakis C60 derivatives with varying functionalities were 
synthesized, and their photochemical properties and photodynamic disinfection 
efficiencies were quantitatively evaluated. All these C. derivatives generated 
O2 more efficiently than commercial multihydroxylated C60 (fullerol), as 
assessed by furfuryl alcohol consumption and electron paramagnetic resonance 
analysis. Despite significant agglomeration/aggregation in the aqueous phase to 
micrometer-sized particles, nanosecond laser flash photolysis showed that the 
lifetime of triplet state (a key intermediate for energy transfer responsible 
for (1)O2 production) was comparable to reported values for pristine C. in 
organic phase. As a result of facile (1)O2 production, the Co derivatives 
efficiently inactivated Escherichie coli and MS-2 bacteriophage. Cationic 
aminofullerene hexakis, which likely exerted electrostatic attraction, exhibited 
exceptionally rapid virus inactivation even compared to commercial nano-TiO2 
photocatalyst These unique photodynamic, hydrophilic and cationic properties may 
be instrumental for the development of next generation photocatalysts for 
disinfection applications. The high ROS (reactive oxygen species) production 
activity and associated cytotoxicity are concerns for potential releases of 
functionalized Ca to the environment, and require careful assessment apart from 
other forms of C60 (e.g., nC60) that have been widely studied as model 
nanomaterials but behave differently.

Nonenveloped viruses are shown to be inactivated by singlet oxygen ((1)O2) 
produced in UVA photosensitized aqueous suspensions of a polyhydroxylated 
fullerene (C60(OH)22-24; fullerol, 40 microM). Experiments were performed with 
MS2, a ssRNA bacteriophage, as well as two dsDNA phages: PRD1, which has an 
internal lipid membrane, and T7, which entirely lacks lipids. MS2 was highly 
susceptible to inactivation, having a rate constant of 0.034 min(-1) with UVA 
alone, which increased to 0.102 min(-1) with photoactivated fullerol. PRD1 and 
T7 were not susceptible to UVA alone but were photoinactivated by fullerol with 
rate constants of 0.026 and 0.035 min(-1), respectively. The role of 1(O)2 was 
demonstrated by three independent observations: (i) viruses that were 
insensitive to UVA alone were photoinactivated by rose bengal in the absence of 
fullerol, (ii) beta-carotene reduced (but did not eliminate) photoinactivation 
rates, and (iii) singlet oxygen sensor green fluorescence spectroscopy directly 
detected (1)O2 in UVA illuminated fullerol suspensions. Qualitative evidence is 
also presented that fullerol aggregates were closely associated with viruses 
allowing efficient transfer of 1(O)2 to their capsids. Fourier transform 
infrared spectroscopy revealed significant oxidative modifications to capsid 
proteins but comparatively minor changes to the DNA and (phospho)lipids. Sodium 
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) suggested (1)O2 
induced crosslinking of proteins. Hence, phage inactivation by photoactivated 
fullerol nanoparticles appears to be caused by cross-linking of capsid protein 
secondary structures by exogenous (1)O2 and consequentimpairmentof their ability 
to bind to surface receptors of their bacterial hosts (loss of infectivity) 
rather than by direct reactions with fullerol.

Batch and flow-through experiments were conducted to investigate the removal and 
inactivation of rotavirus (RV) and bacteriophage MS2 using glass fiber coated 
with hematite nanoparticles. Batch tests showed a high removal of MS2 
(2.49x10(11) plaque forming unit/g) and RV (8.9x10(6) focal forming unit/g) at a 
low concentration of hematite nanoparticles in solution (0.043g/L and 0.26g/L, 
respectively). Virus adsorption was, however, decreased in the presence of 
bicarbonate ions and natural organic matter (NOM) in solution, suggesting a 
great affinity of iron oxide nanoparticles for these competitors. Adsorption on 
hematite nanoparticles by MS2 and RV was also tested with aquifer groundwater 
under saturated flow conditions to mimic environmental conditions with promising 
results (8x10(8) plaque forming unit/g and 3x10(4) focal forming unit/g, 
respectively). Desorption of up to 63% of infectious MS2 and only 2% of 
infectious RV from hematite nanoparticles were achieved when an eluant solution 
containing beef extract and glycine was used. Transmission electron microscopy 
(TEM) images showed evidence of electrostatic adsorption of apparently intact 
MS2 and structurally damaged RV particles to hematite nanoparticles. Results 
from this research suggest that a cartridge made of glass fiber coated with 
hematite nanoparticles could be used as a point-of-use device for virus removal 
for drinking water treatment.

Molecular characterization of bacteriophages for microbial source tracking in 
Korea.

We investigated coliphages from various fecal sources, including humans and 
animals, for microbial source tracking in South Korea. Both somatic and 
F+-specific coliphages were isolated from 43 fecal samples from farms, wild 
animal habitats, and human wastewater plants. Somatic coliphages were more 
prevalent and abundant than F+ coliphages in all of the tested fecal samples. We 
further characterized 311 F+ coliphage isolates using RNase sensitivity assays, 
PCR and reverse transcription-PCR, and nucleic acid sequencing. Phylogenetic 
analyses were performed based on the partial nucleic acid sequences of 311 F+ 
coliphages from various sources. F+ RNA coliphages were most prevalent among 
geese (95%) and were least prevalent in cows (5%). Among the genogroups of F+ 
RNA coliphages, most F+ coliphages isolated from animal fecal sources belonged 
to either group I or group IV, and most from human wastewater sources were in 
group II or III. Some of the group I coliphages were present in both human and 
animal source samples. F+ RNA coliphages isolated from various sources were 
divided into two main clusters. All F+ RNA coliphages isolated from human 
wastewater were grouped with Qbeta-like phages, while phages isolated from most 
animal sources were grouped with MS2-like phages. UniFrac significance 
statistical analyses revealed significant differences between human and animal 
bacteriophages. In the principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), F+ RNA coliphages 
isolated from human waste were distinctively separate from those isolated from 
other animal sources. However, F+ DNA coliphages were not significantly 
different or separate in the PCoA. These results demonstrate that proper 
analysis of F+ RNA coliphages can effectively distinguish fecal sources.

Influence of salts and natural organic matter on the stability of bacteriophage 
MS2.

Mylon SE(1), Rinciog CI, Schmidt N, Gutierrez L, Wong GC, Nguyen TH.

Author information:
(1)Department of Chemistry, Lafayette College, Easton, Pennsylvania 18042, USA.

The stability of functionalized nanoparticles generally results from both steric 
and electrostatic interactions. Viruses like bacteriophage MS2 have adopted 
similar strategies for stability against aggregation, including a net negative 
charge under natural water conditions and using polypeptides that form loops 
extending from the surface of the protein capsid for stabilization. In natural 
systems, dissolved organic matter can adsorb to and effectively functionalize 
nanoparticle surfaces, affecting the fate and transport of these nanoparticles. 
We used time-resolved dynamic light scattering to measure the aggregation 
kinetics of a model virus, bacteriophage MS2, across a range of solution 
chemistries to determine what factors might destabilize viruses in aquatic 
systems. In monovalent electrolytes (LiCl, NaCl, and KCl), aggregation of MS2 
could not be induced within a reasonable kinetic time frame, and MS2 was stable 
even at salt concentrations greater than 1.0 M. Aggregation of MS2 could be 
induced in divalent electrolytes when we employed Ca(2+). This trend was also 
observed in solutions containing 10 mg/L Suwannee River organic matter (SROM) 
reference material. Even at Ca(2+) concentrations as high 200 mM, 
diffusion-controlled aggregation was never achieved, demonstrating an additional 
barrier to aggregation. These results were confirmed by small-angle X-ray 
scattering experiments, which indicate a transition from repulsive to attractive 
interactions between MS2 virus particles as monovalent salts are replaced by 
divalent salts.

The electrophoretic mobility shift assay is a useful tool to identify proteins 
and nucleic acids interactions. Traditionally, the nucleic acids fragments are 
end-labeled with (32)P. We present here the use of fluorescent methodologies for 
studies of RNA in place of radioactivity. The method is highly sensitive and 
quantitative with the use of an infrared fluorescence imaging system. 
Fluorescently labeled primers can be used to monitor protein-RNA interactions by 
fluorescent mobility shift assays. The simplicity and validity of this approach 
may have more advantages than that of previous methods that traditionally used 
hazardous radioisotopes. This method was successfully tested in the study of the 
interactions between MS2 Coat Protein and its RNA target.

The Epstein-Barr virus early protein EB2 (also called BMLF1, Mta, or SM), which 
allows the nuclear export of a subset of early and late viral mRNAs derived from 
intronless genes, is essential for the production of infectious virions. An 
important feature of mRNA export factors is their capacity to shuttle 
continuously between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In a previous study, we 
identified a novel CRM1-independent transferable nuclear export signal (NES) at 
the N terminus of EB2, between amino acids 61 and 146. Here we show that this 
NES contains several small arginine-rich domains that cooperate to allow 
efficient interaction with TAP/NXF1. Recruitment of TAP/NXF1 correlates with 
this NES-mediated efficient nuclear export when it is fused to a heterologous 
protein. Moreover, the NES can export mRNAs bearing MS2 RNA-binding sites from 
the nucleus when tethered to the RNA via the MS2 phage coat protein RNA-binding 
domain.

Development of a test system to evaluate procedures for decontamination of 
respirators containing viral droplets.

Protective Technology Laboratory, Pittsburgh, PA 15236, USA.

The aim of this study was to develop a test system to evaluate the effectiveness 
of procedures for decontamination of respirators contaminated with viral 
droplets. MS2 coliphage was used as a surrogate for pathogenic viruses. A viral 
droplet test system was constructed, and the size distribution of viral droplets 
loaded directly onto respirators was characterized using an aerodynamic particle 
sizer. The sizes ranged from 0.5 to 15 mum, and the sizes of the majority of the 
droplets were the range from 0.74 to 3.5 mum. The results also showed that the 
droplet test system generated similar droplet concentrations (particle counts) 
at different respirator locations. The test system was validated by studying the 
relative efficiencies of decontamination of sodium hypochlorite (bleach) and UV 
irradiation with droplets containing MS2 virus on filtering facepiece 
respirators. It was hypothesized that more potent decontamination treatments 
would result in corresponding larger decreases in the number of viable viruses 
recovered from the respirators. Sodium hypochlorite doses of 2.75 to 5.50 
mg/liter with a 10-min decontamination period resulted in approximately 3- to 
4-log reductions in the level of MS2 coliphage. When higher sodium hypochlorite 
doses (> or =8.25 mg/liter) were used with the same contact time that was used 
for the dilute solutions containing 2.75 to 5.50 mg/liter, all MS2 was 
inactivated. For UV decontamination at a wavelength of 254 nm, an approximately 
3-log reduction in the level of MS2 virus was achieved with dose of 4.32 J/cm(2) 
(3 h of contact time with a UV intensity of 0.4 mW/cm(2)), while with higher 
doses of UV irradiation (> or =7.20 J/cm(2); UV intensity, 0.4 mW/cm(2); contact 
times, > or =5 h), all MS2 was inactivated. These findings may lead to 
development of a standard method to test decontamination of respirators 
challenged by viral droplets.

Assessment of MS-2 phage and salt tracers to characterize axial dispersion in 
water distribution systems.

The present study investigates the axial dispersion and retardation patterns of 
viruses in a pressurized water distribution pipe using MS-2 as a surrogate. The 
results were obtained by using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), along with a 
hydraulic and water quality model. These models included the plug flow 
assumption and were first used to estimate transport mechanisms along a pipe. 
These prediction-model results were compared to experimental data using sodium 
chloride as a chemical tracer. Significant axial dispersion and retardation (or 
tailing) was found to exist under laminar flow conditions with high dispersion 
coefficients (E) estimated by CFD runs and salt tracer experiments. A similar 
dispersion pattern was also observed for MS-2, along with a long tailing 
pattern, which is particularly unique. The commonly used water quality model 
showed no axial dispersion (E = 0) under any flow regimes; thus, the plug flow 
assumption could produce significant errors in predicting the transport 
phenomena of chemical and biological constituents in water distribution systems. 
On the other hand, the dispersion curves predicted by the plug flow model and 
CFD are in good agreement with the experimental data in the turbulent flow 
regime, although using computational methods to predict microbial retardation is 
intrinsically difficult. Because the MS-2 demonstrated considerable temporal 
retardation and because its detection limit is much lower than that of the salt 
tracer, MS-2 should make an excellent tracer for characterizing viral transport 
in water distribution systems.

Limited complementarity between U1 snRNA and a retroviral 5' splice site permits 
its attenuation via RNA secondary structure.

Multiple types of regulation are used by cells and viruses to control 
alternative splicing. In murine leukemia virus, accessibility of the 5' splice 
site (ss) is regulated by an upstream region, which can fold into a complex RNA 
stem-loop structure. The underlying sequence of the structure itself is 
negligible, since most of it could be functionally replaced by a simple 
heterologous RNA stem-loop preserving the wild-type splicing pattern. Increasing 
the RNA duplex formation between U1 snRNA and the 5'ss by a compensatory 
mutation in position +6 led to enhanced splicing. Interestingly, this mutation 
affects splicing only in the context of the secondary structure, arguing for a 
dynamic interplay between structure and primary 5'ss sequence. The reduced 5'ss 
accessibility could also be counteracted by recruiting a splicing enhancer 
domain via a modified MS2 phage coat protein to a single binding site at the tip 
of the simple RNA stem-loop. The mechanism of 5'ss attenuation was revealed 
using hyperstable U1 snRNA mutants, showing that restricted U1 snRNP access is 
the cause of retroviral alternative splicing.

pathogen transport in groundwater.

Consuming pathogen-contaminated groundwater has caused many waterborne disease 
worldwide. Microspheres are often used as pathogen surrogates because they can 
be made similar to pathogens in terms of their sizes, buoyant densities, and 
shapes. Laboratory studies have, however, shown that the surface charges of 
microspheres are very different from those of pathogens of comparable sizes, and 
that their attenuation and transport behaviors differ significantly to those of 
the pathogens mimicked. Thus, for microspheres to be better surrogates, their 
surface charges need to be modified. We have demonstrated that the surface 
charge of a microorganism can be closely mimicked by microspheres covalently 
coated with a protein that has a similar pHPZC to the microorganism. Using MS2 
bacteriophage to test our concept, 20 nm carboxylated microspheres were 
covalently coated with casein. Zeta potentials as a function of pH were 
determined for purified MS2, casein, and uncoated and coated microspheres. The 
uncoated microspheres were significantly more negatively charged than MS2. The 
coated microspheres displayed zeta potentials and a pHPZC value similar to MS2. 
The modified surface charge on the microspheres was stable for at least 4 mo. 
Using the concept developed from this study, surrogates for many specific 
pathogens of concern can be developed, and the results can be corrected with 
pathogen die-off determined independently in the laboratory. Protein-coated 
microspheres could provide a new and alternative approach to investigate 
pathogen transport in groundwater. Future research is required to validate the 
surrogates' resemblances to pathogens in terms of their attenuation and 
transport behaviors in groundwater.

Concentrating diverse microbes in a time and cost effective manner is an 
essential component in water quality monitoring of recreational beaches. 
Historically, detection of bacteria and viruses requires two different capture 
methods to detect both types of organisms in a given water sample. The purpose 
of this present study was to evaluate a newly devised dual layered filtration 
system, which was developed to simultaneously concentrate both viruses and 
bacteria in one step from marine waters. An apparatus was designed to 
accommodate two 90-mm diam., 0.45 microm pore size membranes in series, one on 
top of the other. The top polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane was used to 
filter bacteria by physical straining while the bottom HA membrane retained 
viruses through adsorption. Results indicated that the dual layer filtration 
system recovered 83+/-14% of the test bacteria (Enterococcus fecalis) and 
81+/-28% of the test virus (MS2 coliphage) on the top and bottom membranes, 
respectively. This research demonstrates the potential of using a dual layered 
filtration system for the simultaneous concentration of both bacteria and 
viruses on separate filters from recreational beach waters. This system is 
relatively simple to use, inexpensive, and has the potential to be suitable for 
routine monitoring. This study serves as a proof of concept for the technique. 
Additional experiments are needed to evaluate the system on a variety of 
different bacteria and viruses as well as on water with different physical and 
chemical parameters.

GAC adsorption filters as barriers for viruses, bacteria and protozoan (oo)cysts 
in water treatment.

Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) adsorption filtration is commonly used in 
drinking water treatment to remove NOM and micro-pollutants and on base of the 
process conditions a certain capacity to eliminate pathogenic micro-organisms 
was expected. The experiences with the mandatory quantitative microbial risk 
assessment of Dutch drinking water revealed a lack of knowledge on the 
elimination capacity of this process for pathogens. The objective of the current 
study was to determine the capacity of GAC filtration to remove MS2, Escherichia 
coli and spores of Clostridium bifermentans as process indicators for pathogens 
and more directly of (oo)cysts of Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia lamblia. 
Challenge tests with fresh and loaded GAC were performed in pilot plant GAC 
filters supplied with pre-treated surface water at a contact time which was half 
of the contact time of the full-scale GAC filters. MS2 phages were not removed 
and the removal of E. coli and the anaerobic spores was limited ranging from < 
or =0.1-1.1 log. The (oo)cysts of C. parvum and G. lamblia, however, were 
removed significantly (1.3-2.7 log). On base of the results of the experiments 
and the filtration conditions the removal of the indicator bacteria and 
(oo)cysts was largely attributed to attachment. The model of the Colloid 
Filtration Theory was used to describe the removal of the dosed biocolloids in 
the GAC filters, but the results demonstrated that there is a lack of 
quantitative knowledge about the influence of collector characteristics on the 
two major CFT parameters, the single collector and the sticking efficiency.

Polyhexamethylene biguanide exposure leads to viral aggregation.

Pinto F(1), Maillard JY, Denyer SP, McGeechan P.

Author information:
(1)Welsh School of Pharmacy, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.

AIMS: This study reports the activity of two biguanides against MS2 
bacteriophage used as a surrogate virus for nonenveloped mammalian viruses and 
provides an explanation as to their apparent limited efficacy.
METHODS AND RESULTS: When tested in a standard suspension test, two 
polyhexamethylene biguanides (PHMB), VANTOCIL TG and COSMOCIL CQ, reduced the 
viability of MS2 by only 1-2 log(10) PFU ml(-1). Exposure time up to 30 min did 
not affect the activity of the biguanides, although both PHMB were shown to 
strongly interact with MS2 proteins.
CONCLUSIONS: Inactivation kinetics and change in virus hydrophobicity suggested 
that PHMB induces the formation of viral aggregates. This hypothesis was 
supported using dynamic light scattering that showed an increase in viral 
aggregates sizes (up to 500 nm) in a concentration-dependent manner.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: It has been reported that viral 
aggregation is responsible for virus survival to the biocide exposure. Here, 
this might be the case, because the virucidal activity of the biguanides was 
modest and viral aggregation important. The formation of viral aggregates during 
virus exposure to PHMB was unlikely to overestimate the virucidal potential of 
the biguanides.

BACKGROUND: Respiratory protective devices exposed to pathogenic microorganisms 
present a potential source of transmission of infection during handling. In this 
study, the efficacy of 4 antimicrobial respirators to decontaminate MS2, a 
surrogate for pathogenic viruses, was evaluated and compared with control N95 
filtering face piece respirators, which did not contain any known antimicrobial 
components.
METHODS: MS2 containing droplet nuclei were generated using a Collison nebulizer 
and loaded onto respirator coupons at a face velocity of 13.2 cm/seconds for 30 
minutes. The coupons were incubated at 2 different temperature and relative 
humidity (RH) conditions and analyzed for viable MS2 at different time 
intervals.
RESULTS: Results showed that log(10) reduction of MS2 was not statistically 
significant (P > .05) between the control and antimicrobial respirator coupons, 
when stored at 22 degrees C and 30% RH up to 20 hours. Coupons from 1 of the 4 
antimicrobial respirators showed an average MS2 log(10) reduction of 3.7 at 37 
degrees C and 80% RH for 4 hours, which was statistically significant (P < or = 
.05) compared with coupons from the control respirators.
CONCLUSION: Results from this study suggest that MS2 virus decontamination 
efficacy of antimicrobial respirators is dependent on the antimicrobial agent 
and storage conditions.

Novel inactivation methods are needed to control the spread of foodborne viruses 
responsible for nonbacterial gastroenteritis worldwide. The advent of 
high-pressure homogenization combining high pressure, shear stress, and 
cavitation provides the opportunity to evaluate this technology for viral 
inactivation in fluid foods under continuous processing conditions. Our 
objective was to evaluate murine norovirus (MNV-1) and MS2 coliphage 
(single-stranded RNA) as human enteric virus surrogates for their susceptibility 
to a novel high-pressure homogenization process for application in commercial 
settings. Experiments were conducted in duplicate with MNV-1 and MS2 coliphage 
in phosphate-buffered saline, using homogenization pressures of 0, 100, 200, 
250, and 300 MPa (the maximum achievable by the homogenizer), resulting in 
exposure temperatures of 24, 46, 63, 70, and 75 degrees C, respectively, for <2 
s. Only homogenization pressures of 300 MPa at 75 degrees C showed inactivation 
of approximately 3 log PFU for MS2 from an initial approximately 6 log PFU. 
Also, MNV-1 showed inactivation of approximately 0.8 log PFU at 300 MPa. Further 
studies are warranted to validate this inactivation process, which can retain 
the sensory and nutritional value of fluid food and shows promise for 
application in industrial environments.

Dynamic allostery controls coat protein conformer switching during MS2 phage 
assembly.

Previously, an RNA stem-loop (TR) encompassing 19 nt of the genome of 
bacteriophage MS2 was shown to act as an allosteric effector of conformational 
switching in the coat protein during in vitro capsid assembly. TR RNA binding to 
symmetric coat protein dimers results in conformational changes, principally at 
the FG-loop connecting the F and G beta-strands in each subunit, yielding an 
asymmetric structure. The FG-loops define the quasi-equivalent conformers of the 
coat protein subunit (A, B, and C) in the T=3 capsid. Efficient assembly of this 
capsid in vitro requires that both symmetrical and asymmetrical forms of the 
coat protein dimer be present in solution, implying that they closely resemble 
the quasi-equivalent dimers (A/B and C/C) seen in the final capsid. Experiments 
show that assembly can be triggered by a number of RNA stem-loops unrelated to 
TR in sequence and detailed secondary structure, suggesting that there is little 
sequence specificity to the allosteric effect. Since the stem-loop binding site 
on the coat protein dimer is distal to the FG-loops the mechanism of this 
switching effect needs to be investigated. We have analyzed the vibrational 
modes of both TR-bound and RNA-free coat protein dimers using an all-atom 
normal-mode analysis. The results suggest that asymmetric contacts between the 
A-duplex RNA phosphodiester backbone and the EF-loop in one coat protein subunit 
result in the FG-loop of that subunit becoming more dynamic, whilst the 
equivalent loop on the other monomer decreases its mobility. The increased 
dynamic behaviour occurs in the FG-loop of the subunit required to undergo the 
largest conformational change when adopting the quasi-equivalent B conformation. 
The free energy barrier on the pathway to form this new structure would 
consequently be reduced compared to the unbound subunit. Our results also imply 
that the allosteric effect should be independent of the base sequence of the 
bound stem-loop, as observed experimentally. As a test of this model, we also 
examined the vibrational modes of a known assembly mutant, W82R, which cannot 
assemble beyond dimer. This mutation leads to an increased mobility of the 
DE-loop rather than the FG-loop after TR binding, consistent with the 
non-assembling phenotype of this mutant protein.

Viral genomic single-stranded RNA directs the pathway toward a T=3 capsid.

The molecular mechanisms controlling genome packaging by single-stranded RNA 
viruses are still largely unknown. It is necessary in most cases for the protein 
to adopt different conformations at different positions on the capsid lattice in 
order to form a viral capsid from multiple copies of a single protein. We showed 
previously that such quasi-equivalent conformers of RNA bacteriophage MS2 coat 
protein dimers (CP(2)) can be switched by sequence-specific interaction with a 
short RNA stem-loop (TR) that occurs only once in the wild-type phage genome. In 
principle, multiple switching events are required to generate the phage T=3 
capsid. We have therefore investigated the sequence dependency of this event 
using two RNA aptamer sequences selected to bind the phage coat protein and an 
analogous packaging signal from phage Qbeta known to be discriminated against by 
MS2 coat protein both in vivo and in vitro. All three non-cognate stem-loops 
support T=3 shell formation, but none shows the kinetic-trapping effect seen 
when TR is mixed with equimolar CP(2). We show that this reflects the fact that 
they are poor ligands compared with TR, failing to saturate the coat protein 
under the assay conditions, ensuring that sufficient amounts of both types of 
dimer required for efficient assembly are present in these reactions. Increasing 
the non-cognate RNA concentration restores the kinetic trap, confirming this 
interpretation. We have also assessed the effects of extending the TR stem-loop 
at the 5' or 3' end with short genomic sequences. These longer RNAs all show 
evidence of the kinetic trap, reflecting the fact that they all contain the TR 
sequence and are more efficient at promoting capsid formation than TR. Mass 
spectrometry has shown that at least two pathways toward the T=3 shell occur in 
TR-induced assembly reactions: one via formation of a 3-fold axis and another 
that creates an extended 5-fold complex. The longer genomic RNAs suppress the 
5-fold pathway, presumably as a consequence of steric clashes between multiply 
bound RNAs. Reversing the orientation of the extension sequences with respect to 
the TR stem-loop produces RNAs that are poor assembly initiators. The data 
support the idea that RNA-induced protein conformer switching occurs throughout 
assembly of the T=3 shell and show that both positional and sequence-specific 
effects outside the TR stem-loop can have significant impacts on the precise 
assembly pathway followed.

Efficacy of chemical treatments against murine norovirus, feline calicivirus, 
and MS2 bacteriophage.

Human noroviruses pose an emerging public health threat, and despite stringent 
control strategies, variant strains continue to spread and cause disease 
outbreaks. Routinely used chemical sanitizers, such as sodium hypochlorite 
though effective on food contact surfaces, require high concentrations to cause 
reduction in enteric viral titers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
efficacy of trisodium phosphate (TSP) against three human enteric virus 
surrogates, murine norovirus (MNV-1), feline calicivirus (FCV), and 
bacteriophage MS2 in comparison to routinely used sanitizers. Three 
concentrations of TSP (1%, 2%, and 5%) at different contact times (30 sec and 1 
min) were evaluated against the surrogate viruses individually inoculated on 
formica coupons. Our results showed that 5% TSP was effective in obtaining a 
>or=6 log(10) PFU reduction for MNV-1, FCV, and MS2 after a contact time of only 
30 sec or 1 min similar to 10% household bleach (0.6% sodium hypochlorite, 5000 
ppm available chlorine) for high titers of FCV and MS2, and with approximately 5 
log(10) reduction after either 30 sec or 1 min on low viral titers. However, 2% 
TSP for 1 min resulted in >or=6 log(10) PFU reduction for FCV and MS2, but only 
a 1.05 log(10) PFU reduction for MNV-1 at high titers, with similar results 
after 30 sec. Decreasing TSP levels to 1% reduced FCV by approximately 2.65 
log(10) PFU, MS2 by 4.5 log(10) PFU at high titers, and no reduction for MNV-1 
after 30-sec or 1 min contact. Glutaraldehyde (2%) reduced FCV and MNV-1 titers 
by approximately 6 log(10) PFU; however, MS2 was reduced by only 3.22 and 3.74 
log(10) PFU after 30 sec and 1 min, respectively, while 70% ethanol was not 
effective in reducing the three viruses at either high or low titers at both 
contact times. Alternative control strategies using TSP with short contact times 
should benefit the food industry in reducing norovirus transmission.

Norovirus (NV) is an important human pathogen that causes epidemic acute 
nonbacterial gastroenteritis worldwide. Because of the lack of a cell culture 
system or an animal model for this virus, studies of drinking water treatment 
such as separation and disinfection processes are still hampered. We 
successfully estimated NV removal performance during a coagulation-rapid sand 
filtration process by using recombinant NV virus-like particles (rNV-VLPs) 
morphologically and antigenically similar to native NV. The behaviors of two 
widely accepted surrogates for pathogenic waterborne viruses, bacteriophages 
Qbeta and MS2, were also investigated for comparison with that of rNV-VLPs. 
Approximately 3-log(10) removals were observed for rNV-VLPs with a dose of 40 
muM-Al or -Fe, as polyaluminum chloride at pH 6.8 or ferric chloride at pH 5.8, 
respectively. Smaller removal ratios were obtained with alum and ferric chloride 
at pH 6.8. The removal performance for MS2 was somewhat larger than that for 
rNV-VLPs, meaning that MS2 is not recommended as an appropriate surrogate for 
native NV. By comparison, the removal performance for Qbeta was similar to, or 
smaller than, that for rNV-VLPs. However, the removal performances for rNV-VLPs 
and Qbeta differed between the coagulation process and the following rapid sand 
filtration process. Therefore, Qbeta also is not recommended as an appropriate 
surrogate for native NV.

This study assessed the efficacy of two commonly used gaseous disinfection 
systems against high concentrations of a resistant viral surrogate in the 
presence and absence of soiling. MS2 bacteriophage suspensions were dried on to 
stainless steel carriers and exposed to hydrogen peroxide vapour (HPV) and 
vapour hydrogen peroxide (VHP) gaseous disinfection systems. The bacteriophages 
were also suspended and dried in 10% and 50% of horse blood to simulate the 
virus being present in a spill of blood/bodily fluids in a hospital ward 
environment. Carriers were removed from the gaseous disinfectant at regular 
intervals into phosphate-buffered saline, vortexed and assayed using a standard 
plaque assay. The effectiveness of both the HPV and VHP systems varied with the 
concentration of the bacteriophage with HPV resulting in a 6log(10) reduction in 
10 min at the lowest viral concentration [10(7) plaque-forming units 
(pfu)/carrier] and requiring 45 min at the highest concentration (10(9) 
pfu/carrier). For the VHP system a 30 min exposure period was required to 
achieve a 6log(10) reduction at the lowest concentration and 60-90 min for the 
highest concentration. The addition of blood to the suspension greatly reduced 
the effectiveness of both disinfectants. This study demonstrates that the 
effectiveness of gaseous disinfectants against bacteriophage is a function of 
the viral concentration as well as the degree of soiling. It highlights the 
importance of effective cleaning prior to gaseous disinfection especially where 
high concentration agents are suspended in body fluids to ensure effective 
decontamination in hospitals.

bacteriophages.

Mutational fitness effects can be measured with relatively high accuracy in 
viruses due to their small genome size, which facilitates full-length sequencing 
and genetic manipulation. Previous work has shown that animal and plant RNA 
viruses are very sensitive to mutation. Here, we characterize mutational fitness 
effects in single-stranded (ss) DNA and ssRNA bacterial viruses. First, we 
performed a mutation-accumulation experiment in which we subjected three ssDNA 
(PhiX174, G4, F1) and three ssRNA phages (Qbeta, MS2, and SP) to 
plaque-to-plaque transfers and chemical mutagenesis. Genome sequencing and 
growth assays indicated that the average fitness effect of the accumulated 
mutations was similar in the two groups. Second, we used site-directed 
mutagenesis to obtain 45 clones of PhiX174 and 42 clones of Qbeta carrying 
random single-nucleotide substitutions and assayed them for fitness. In PhiX174, 
20% of such mutations were lethal, whereas viable ones reduced fitness by 13% on 
average. In Qbeta, these figures were 29% and 10%, respectively. It seems 
therefore that high mutational sensitivity is a general property of viruses with 
small genomes, including those infecting animals, plants, and bacteria. 
Mutational fitness effects are important for understanding processes of fitness 
decline, but also of neutral evolution and adaptation. As such, these findings 
can contribute to explain the evolution of ssDNA and ssRNA viruses.

Characterization of reaerosolization from impingers in an effort to improve 
airborne virus sampling.

AIMS: To assess the impact of reaerosolization from liquid impingement methods 
on airborne virus sampling.
METHODS AND RESULTS: An AGI-30 impinger containing particles [MS2 bacteriophage 
or 30-nm polystyrene latex (PSL)] of known concentration was operated with 
sterile air. Reaerosolized particles as a function of sampling flow rate and 
particle concentration in the impinger collection liquid were characterized 
using a scanning mobility particle sizer. Reaerosolization from the impinger was 
also compared to that from a BioSampler. Results show that reaerosolization 
increases as flow rate increases. While the increased particle concentration in 
the impinger collection liquid leads to an increase in the reaerosolization of 
PSL particles, it does not necessarily lead to an increase in the 
reaerosolization of virus particles. Reaerosolization of virus particles begins 
to decrease as the particle concentration in the impinger collection liquid 
rises above 10(6) PFU ml(-1). This phenomenon results from aggregation of viral 
particles at high concentrations. Compared with micron-sized particles, 
nanosized virus particles are easier to aerosolize because of reduced inertia. 
Reaerosolization from the BioSampler is demonstrated to be significantly less 
than that from the impinger.
CONCLUSIONS: Reaerosolization from impingement sampling methods is a mode of 
loss in airborne virus sampling, although it is not as significant a limitation 
as the primary particle size of the aerosol. Utilizing a BioSampler coupled with 
short sampling periods to prevent high accumulative concentrations can minimize 
the impact of reaerosolization.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study confirms reaerosolization of 
virus particles to be a mode of loss in impingement sampling and identifies 
methods to minimize the loss.

Hollow-fiber ultrafiltration for the concentration and simultaneous recovery of 
multiple pathogens in contaminated foods.

School of Public Health, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.

We investigated the possibility of using hollow-fiber ultrafiltration (HUF) for 
the simultaneous recovery of multiple microorganisms in food samples. MS2 
bacteriophage, E. coli, Bacillus subtilis spores, and murine norovirus (MNV) 
were each inoculated into 5 liters of either distilled water (DW) or glycine 
elution buffer and then concentrated using hollow-fiber polysulfone 
ultrafilters. The resulting concentrates were further analyzed by either 
cultivation or TaqMan real-time reverse transcription PCR assay. The overall 
average recovery rates were 7.1% in DW and 17.1% in glycine elution buffer. When 
the virus, vegetative bacteria, and bacterial spores were simultaneously 
inoculated into DW, glycine, or Tris-HCl elution buffers, on average 16.8% of 
inoculated microorganisms were recovered by HUF. The addition of 3% beef extract 
blocking buffer to HUF increased the total recovery rate to 46.1%, with 
incremental recovery rates increasing sharply for B. subtilis spores and MNV. 
Use of HUF resulted in E. coli recovery rates of 68.0% on lettuce and 66.2% on 
ham and MNV recovery rates of 1.5% on lettuce and 5.8% on ham. Our study 
demonstrates that HUF can be effective at simultaneously recovering and 
concentrating diverse bacterial and viral pathogens from foods.

Chitosan is known to inhibit microorganisms of concern to plants, animals, and 
humans. However, the effect of chitosan on human enteric viruses of public 
health concern has not been extensively investigated. The purpose of this study 
was to determine the effect of chitosan on three human enteric viral surrogates: 
murine norovirus 1 (MNV-1), feline calicivirus F-9 (FCV-F9), and (ssRNA) 
bacteriophage MS2 (MS2). Chitosan oligosaccharide lactate (molecular weight of 
5,000) and water-soluble chitosan (molecular weight of 53,000) at concentrations 
of 1.4, 0.7, and 0.35% were incubated at 37 degrees C for 3 h with equal volumes 
of each virus at high (approximately 7 log PFU/ml) and low (approximately 5 log 
PFU/ml) titers. Chitosan effects on each treated virus were evaluated with 
standardized plaque assays in comparison to untreated virus controls. The 
water-soluble chitosan at 0.7% decreased the FCV-F9 titer by approximately 2.83 
log PFU/ml, with decreasing effects at lower concentrations, and also decreased 
MS2 at high titers by approximately 1.18 to 1.41 log PFU/ml, regardless of the 
concentration used. Chitosan treatments at the concentrations studied had no 
effect on MNV-1 at high titers. Chitosan oligosaccharide showed similar trends 
against the viruses, but to a lesser extent compared with that of water-soluble 
chitosan. When lower virus titers (approximately 5 log PFU/ml) were used, plaque 
reduction was observed for FCV-F9 and MS2, but not MNV-1. The use of 
higher-molecular-weight chitosan and at higher concentrations with longer 
incubation may be necessary to inactivate MNV-1. These results in the plaque 
reduction of human enteric virus surrogates by chitosan treatment show promise 
for its potential application in the food environment.

Effects of pH, ionic strength, dissolved organic matter, and flow rate on the 
co-transport of MS2 bacteriophages with kaolinite in gravel aquifer media.

Viruses are often associated with colloids in wastewater and could be 
transported with colloids into groundwater from land disposal of human and 
animal effluent and sludge, causing contamination of groundwater. To investigate 
the role of colloids in the transport of viruses in groundwater, experiments 
were conducted using a 2m long column packed with heterogeneous gravel aquifer 
media. Bacteriophage MS2 was used as the model virus and kaolinite as the model 
colloid. Experimental data were analyzed using Temporal Moment Analysis and 
Filtration Theory. In the absence of kaolinite colloid, MS2 phage traveled 
slightly faster than the conservative tracer bromide (Br), with little 
differences observed between unfiltered and filtered MS2 phage (0.22 microm as 
the operational cut-off for colloid-free virus). In the presence of kaolinite 
colloids, MS2 phage breakthrough occurred concurrently with that of the 
colloidal particles and the time taken to reach the peak virus concentration was 
reduced, suggesting a colloid-facilitated virus transport in terms of 
peak-concentration time and velocity. Meanwhile mass recovery and magnitude of 
concentrations of the phages were significantly reduced, indicating 
colloid-assisted virus attenuation in terms of concentrations and mass. 
Decreasing the pH or increasing the ionic strength increased the level of virus 
attachment to the aquifer media and colloids, and virus transport became more 
retarded, resulting in lower peak-concentration, lower mass recovery, longer 
peak-concentration time, and greater apparent collision efficiency. Increasing 
the concentration of dissolved organic matter (DOM) or flow rate resulted in 
faster virus transport velocity, higher peak-concentrations and mass recoveries, 
and lower apparent collision efficiencies. The dual-role of colloids in 
transport viruses has important implications for risk analysis and remediation 
of virus-contaminated sites.

Effect of surfactants, temperature, and sonication on the virucidal activity of 
polyhexamethylene biguanide against the bacteriophage MS2.

BACKGROUND: Virucidal compounds are essential in preventing the transmission of 
viral infection in the health care environment. Understanding their mechanisms 
of action is necessary to improve their efficacy. Inactivation of viruses is 
less documented than that of bacteria notably because different types of virus 
have diverse response to microbicides, making difficult to establish an 
inactivation pattern.
METHODS: The effect of viral aggregates on the virucidal activity of 
polyhexamethylene biguanide-based microbicide VANTOCIL TG (Arch Chemicals, 
Manchester, UK) against the bacteriophage MS2 was investigated by using in 
combination a standard suspension efficacy test under different conditions and 
dynamic light scattering measuring the presence and size of aggregates.
RESULTS: Temperature had a key role in increasing significantly the virucidal 
activity of VANTOCIL TG, reducing virus concentration by 4-log(10) within 10 
minutes at 40 degrees C. The high temperature was linked to a reduction of viral 
aggregates despite the exposure to the biguanide. In addition, the viral 
inactivation kinetic became significantly more linear at 30 degrees C and 40 
degrees C. Such results were also observed with sonication during treatment, 
where a first-order kinetic was observed. However, the addition of surfactants, 
even though there was evidence of a decrease in viral clumps, did not enhance 
the virucidal activity of polyhexamethylene biguanide.
CONCLUSION: The presence of viral aggregates was an important factor in the 
virucidal efficacy of the biguanide as demonstrated by the correlation among 
high temperature, decrease in aggregates, and increase in activity, although it 
is possible that high temperatures might also cause conformational changes of 
the viral capsid, increasing the sensitivity of virions to the microbicide.

Low-cost options for the treatment of drinking water at the household level are 
being explored by the Cambodian government and non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs) working in Cambodia, where many lack access to improved drinking water 
sources and diarrhoeal diseases are the most prevalent cause of death in 
children under 5 years of age. The ceramic water purifier (CWP), a locally 
produced, low-cost ceramic filter, is now being implemented by several NGOs, and 
an estimated 100,000+households in the country now use them for drinking water 
treatment. Two candidate filters were tested for the reduction of bacterial and 
viral surrogates for waterborne pathogens using representative Cambodian 
drinking water sources (rainwater and surface water) spiked with Escherichia 
coli and bacteriophage MS2. Results indicate that filters were capable of 
reducing key microbes in the laboratory with mean reductions of E. coli of 
approximately 99% and mean reduction of bacteriophages of 90-99% over >600 
litres throughput. Increased effectiveness was not observed in filters with an 
AgNO3 amendment. At under US$10 per filter, locally produced ceramic filters may 
be a promising option for drinking water treatment and safe storage at the 
household level.

Metabolic investigation of host/pathogen interaction using MS2-infected 
Escherichia coli.

Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269, USA. jainr@ornl.gov

BACKGROUND: RNA viruses are responsible for a variety of illnesses among people, 
including but not limited to the common cold, the flu, HIV, and ebola. 
Developing new drugs and new strategies for treating diseases caused by these 
viruses can be an expensive and time-consuming process. Mathematical modeling 
may be used to elucidate host-pathogen interactions and highlight potential 
targets for drug development, as well providing the basis for optimizing patient 
treatment strategies. The purpose of this work was to determine whether a 
genome-scale modeling approach could be used to understand how metabolism is 
impacted by the host-pathogen interaction during a viral infection. Escherichia 
coli/MS2 was used as the host-pathogen model system as MS2 is easy to work with, 
harmless to humans, but shares many features with eukaryotic viruses. In 
addition, the genome-scale metabolic model of E. coli is the most comprehensive 
model at this time.
RESULTS: Employing a metabolic modeling strategy known as "flux balance 
analysis" coupled with experimental studies, we were able to predict how viral 
infection would alter bacterial metabolism. Based on our simulations, we 
predicted that cell growth and biosynthesis of the cell wall would be halted. 
Furthermore, we predicted a substantial increase in metabolic activity of the 
pentose phosphate pathway as a means to enhance viral biosynthesis, while a 
break down in the citric acid cycle was predicted. Also, no changes were 
predicted in the glycolytic pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: Through our approach, we have developed a technique of modeling 
virus-infected host metabolism and have investigated the metabolic effects of 
viral infection. These studies may provide insight into how to design better 
drugs. They also illustrate the potential of extending such metabolic analysis 
to higher order organisms, including humans.

Reports of a novel influenza virus type A (H1N1), now designated by the World 
Health Organization as pandemic (H1N1) 2009, emerged from the United States and 
Mexico in April 2009. The management of the pandemic in Australia required rapid 
and reliable testing of large numbers of specimens for the novel influenza 
strain and differentiation from seasonal influenza strains. A real-time reverse 
transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assay for the detection of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 was 
designed and used with existing real-time RT-PCR assays for seasonal influenza 
viruses A and B. MS2 coliphage was added to all samples and amplified as a 
quality control. Three duplex RT-PCR assays, each containing two primer pairs 
and corresponding 5' nuclease probes, were initially evaluated on control 
material and stored samples and showed high sensitivity and specificity. More 
than 11,000 clinical samples were then tested for influenza A and B matrix gene 
targets and specific hemagglutinin gene targets for seasonal influenza A/H1, 
A/H3, and pandemic A (H1N1) 2009. Minimum sensitivities and specificities were 
98.8% and 100%, respectively, for pandemic (H1N1) 2009, 81.5% and 98.9% for 
seasonal A/H1, and 96.3% and 99.6% for A/H3. Automated sample extraction 
facilitated the rapid processing of samples so that the assays allowed accurate, 
rapid, and cost-effective screening of large numbers of clinical samples.

Combined use of MS2 and PP7 coat fusions shows that TIA-1 dominates hnRNP A1 for 
K-SAM exon splicing control.

Splicing of the FGFR2 K-SAM exon is repressed by hnRNP A1 bound to the exon and 
activated by TIA-1 bound to the downstream intron. Both proteins are expressed 
similarly by cells whether they splice the exon or not, so it is important to 
know which one is dominant. To answer this question, we used bacteriophage PP7 
and bacteriophage MS2 coat fusions to tether hnRNP A1 and TIA-1 to distinct 
sites on the same pre-mRNA molecule. hnRNP A1 fused to one coat protein was 
tethered to a K-SAM exon containing the corresponding coat protein's binding 
site. TIA-1 fused to the other coat protein was tethered to the downstream 
intron containing that coat protein's binding site. This led to efficient K-SAM 
exon splicing. Our results show that TIA-1 is dominant for K-SAM exon splicing 
control and validate the combined use of PP7 and MS2 coat proteins for studying 
posttranscriptional events.

Contaminated drinking water is responsible for causing diarrheal diseases that 
kill millions of people a year. Additionally, toxin-producing blue-green algae 
associated with diarrhea and neurologic effects continues to be an issue for 
many drinking water supplies. Disinfection has been used to reduce these risks. 
A novel gravity-fed household drinking water system with canisters containing 
N-halamine bromine or chlorine media was challenged with MS2 bacteriophage and 
microcystin. Chlorine and bromine systems were effective against this virus, 
with an mean +/- SE reduction of 2.98 +/- 0.26 log(10) and 5.02 +/- 0.19 
log(10), respectively. Microcystin toxin was reduced by 27.5% and 88.5% to 
overall mean +/- SE concentrations of 1,600 +/- 98 ng/L and 259 +/- 50 ng/L for 
the chlorine and bromine canisters, respectively. Only the bromine units 
consistently produced microcystin effluent < 1,000 ng/L (the World Health 
Organization recommended level) when challenged with 2,500 ng/L and consistently 
surpassed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency virus reduction goal of 
99.99%.

systems.

United States. zakir.hirani@mwhglobal.com

A pilot study was conducted over a period of 18 months at the Point Loma 
Wastewater Treatment Plant (PLWWTP) in San Diego, CA to evaluate the operational 
and water quality performance of six selected membrane bioreactor (MBR) systems 
at average and peak flux operation. Each of these systems was operated at peak 
flux for 4 h a day for six consecutive days to assess peak flux performance. 
Virus seeding studies were also conducted during peak flux operation to assess 
the capability of these systems to reject MS-2 coliphage. When operating at 
steady state, these MBR systems achieved an effluent BOD concentration of <2 
mg/L and a turbidity of <0.1 NTU. Peak flux for the MBR systems ranged from 56 
to 76 L/m2/h (liters per square meter per hour) with peaking factors in the 
range of 1.5-3.2. When switching from average to peak flux operation, a 
reversible drop of 22-32% in temperature-corrected permeability was observed for 
all submerged MBR systems. The percent drop in permeability increased as MLSS 
concentration in the membrane tank increased from 11,100 mg/L to 15,300 mg/L and 
was observed to be highest for the system operating at highest MLSS 
concentration. Such trends were not observed with an external MBR system. Each 
MBR system was able to sustain a 4-h-a-day peak flow for six consecutive days 
with only moderate membrane fouling. The membrane fouling was quantified by 
measuring the drop in temperature-corrected permeability. This drop ranged from 
13 to 33% over six days for different submerged MBR systems. The MBR systems 
achieved microbial removal in the range of 5.8-6.9 logs for total coliform 
bacteria, >5.5 to >6.0 logs for fecal coliform bacteria and 2.6 to >3.4 logs for 
indigenous MS-2 coliphages. When operating at peak flux, seeded MS-2 coliphage 
removal ranged from 1.0 to 4.4 logs, respectively. The higher log removal values 
(LRVs) for indigenous MS-2 coliphage among different MBR systems were probably 
the result of particle association of indigenous coliphage. Differences in 
membrane pore size (0.04-0.2 microm) amongst the MBR systems evaluated did not 
have a substantial impact on indigenous MS-2 coliphage removal, but seeded MS-2 
coliphage removal varied among the different MBR systems.

Fenton's reagent (i.e., Fe[II]/H2O2) is known to generate strong oxidants 
capable of oxidizing a broad spectrum of organic compounds in aqueous solution. 
This study demonstrates the successful inactivation of MS2 coliphage (MS2) by 
the oxidants produced from Fenton's reagent. The inactivation process of MS2 by 
Fenton's reagent was found to proceed in two distinct stages. The first stage 
inactivation, which took place rapidly within 1 min reaction time, was mainly 
achieved by the reaction of Fe(II) with H2O2 (i.e., the Fenton reaction). The 
second stage, which occurred by the catalytic reactions of Fe(III) with H2O2, 
exhibited much slower inactivation than the first stage. The rate of MS2 
inactivation increased as pH decreased from 8.0 to 6.0. The addition of oxalate 
and humic acids significantly inhibited the MS2 inactivation, whereas 
1,10-phenanthroline and bipyridine resulted in a gradual and steady inactivation 
of MS2. These observations on the effects of pH and iron-chelating agents 
indicate that oxidants formed on the surface or inside MS2 are responsible for 
the inactivation.

Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection is the leading worldwide cause of acute viral 
hepatitis. An important aspect of viral control is rapid diagnosis. 
Epidemiological studies have linked hepatitis A outbreaks to the consumption of 
drinking water or soft fruits exposed to faecal contamination. Real-time reverse 
transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) is now widely used for detecting RNA viruses in food 
samples. Efficiency of viral concentration, nucleic acid extraction and the 
presence of potential inhibitors of the RT-PCR reaction must be monitored to 
prevent false negative results. In this study, the MS2 bacteriophage used as a 
process control was detected simultaneously with HAV in a one-step duplex 
real-time qRT-PCR. The assay was developed for testing water and raspberries. 
Adding MS2 showed no loss of sensitivity for HAV detection in water and 
raspberry samples. The limit of detection of HAV with this new approach was 
10PFU for 1.5L of bottled water, 100PFU for 1.5L of tap water, 50PFU for 25g of 
fresh raspberries and 100PFU for 25g of frozen raspberries. The data show that 
the MS2 offers a very reliable and simple way to monitor false-negative results, 
making it a valuable tool in the routine diagnostics laboratory.

Virus' (MS2, phiX174, and Aichi) attachment on sand measured by atomic force 
microscopy and their transport through sand columns.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to study the attachment of phiX174, MS2, 
and Aichi viruses on sands of different surface properties: oxide-removed 
(clean), goethite-coated, and aluminum oxide-coated. Interaction forces between 
viruses and sand surfaces were measured by contact mode AFM using tips coated 
with particles of each virus. Column experiments were conducted to quantify the 
macroscopic transport and retention of the viruses in sand. The average adhesion 
force measured with AFM was highest between aluminum oxide-coated sand and all 
three viruses, followed by goethite-coated sand, and was significantly lower on 
oxide-removed sand. Among the viruses, adhesion on goethite-coated and aluminum 
oxide-coated sands followed the order of MS2 > Aichi > phiX174, and on 
oxide-removed sand it was phiX174 > Aichi > MS2. Column breakthrough results 
revealed the same retention trend, which was completely consistent with AFM 
force measurements. Strong electrostatic attraction and, to a lesser extent, 
hydrophobic interactions are responsible for the much greater removal of all 
three viruses observed in the oxide-coated sands compared to the oxide-removed 
sand. Mass recovery data indicate that the removal of phiX174, MS2, and Aichi 
was largely reversible when eluted with 3% beef extract solution at pH 9.5. The 
Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) and extended DLVO theories provided 
correct qualitative predictions on the deposition trend observed in the 
experiments. This study, to the best of our knowledge, was the first to employ 
AFM to directly measure interaction forces between viruses and solid surfaces; 
and it was the first to evaluate the retention and transport behavior of Aichi 
virus, a human pathogen.

Inactivation of MS2 coliphage in Fenton and Fenton-like systems: role of 
transition metals, hydrogen peroxide and sunlight.

Nieto-Juarez JI(1), Pierzchła K, Sienkiewicz A, Kohn T.

Switzerland.

The inactivation of coliphage MS2 by iron- and copper-catalyzed Fenton systems 
was studied to assess the importance of this process for virus inactivation in 
natural systems and during water treatment by advanced oxidation processes. The 
influence of H(2)O(2) (3-50 microM) and metal (1-10 microM) concentrations, 
HO(*) production, and sunlight on inactivation was investigated. Inactivation 
was first order with respect to H(2)O(2), but the dependence on the metal 
concentration was more complex. In the Cu/H(2)O(2) system, the inactivation rate 
constant k(obs) increased with added Cu up to 2.5 microM, and then leveled off. 
This was consistent with Cu saturation of the solution, indicating that only 
soluble Cu contributed to inactivation. In contrast, inactivation in the 
Fe/H(2)O(2) system was governed by colloidal iron. Irradiation by sunlight only 
affected the Fe/H(2)O(2) system, leading to a 5.5-fold increase in k(obs) (up to 
3.1 min(-1)). HO(*) production, measured by electron spin resonance, could not 
account for the observed inactivation in the Fe/H(2)O(2) system. Other oxidants, 
such as ferryl species, must therefore play a role. Experiments using bulk 
oxidant scavengers revealed that inactivation occurred by a caged mechanism 
involving oxidant production by metals located in close proximity to the virus. 
Overall, our results show that the Fenton/photo-Fenton process may serve as an 
efficient technology for virus disinfection.

We determined the disinfection efficiency of chlorine and chlorine dioxide 
(ClO(2)) using murine norovirus (MNV) and coliphage MS2 as surrogates for human 
norovirus. Experiments were performed in oxidant demand-free buffer (pH 7.2) at 
5 degrees C and 20 degrees C. The extent of virus inactivation by a disinfectant 
was quantified using three different analytical methods: plaque, short template 
real-time TaqMan reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and 
long template RT-PCR assays. Rapid inactivation of MNV by both chlorine and 
chlorine dioxide was observed by the plaque assay. According to the efficiency 
factor Hom model, Ct values of 0.314mg/Lmin and 0.247mg/Lmin were required for a 
4-log reduction of MNV at 5 degrees C by chlorine and chlorine dioxide, 
respectively. Lower Ct values were required at 20 degrees C. Both long template 
and short template RT-PCR assays significantly underestimated the virus 
inactivation compared to the plaque assay. Our study demonstrates that adequate 
treatment of water with either chlorine or ClO(2) is likely to effectively 
control the waterborne transmission of human norovirus.

All-atom normal-mode analysis reveals an RNA-induced allostery in a 
bacteriophage coat protein.

Dykeman EC(1), Twarock R.

Assembly of the T=3 bacteriophage MS2 is initiated by the binding of a 19 
nucleotide RNA stem loop from within the phage genome to a symmetric coat 
protein dimer. This binding event effects a folding of the FG loop in one of the 
protein subunits of the dimer and results in the formation of an asymmetric 
dimer. Since both the symmetric and asymmetric forms of the dimer are needed for 
the assembly of the protein container, this allosteric switch plays an important 
role in the life cycle of the phage. We provide here details of an all-atom 
normal-mode analysis of this allosteric effect. The results suggest that 
asymmetric contacts between the A -duplex RNA phosphodiester backbone of the 
stem loop with the EF loop in one coat protein subunit results in an increased 
dynamic behavior of its FG loop. The four lowest-frequency modes, which 
encompass motions predominantly on the FG loops, account for over 90% of the 
increased dynamic behavior due to a localization of the vibrational pattern on a 
single FG loop. Finally, we show that an analysis of the allosteric effect using 
an elastic network model fails to predict this localization effect, highlighting 
the importance of using an all-atom full force field method for this problem.

Norovirus (NV) is a prototype strain of a group of human caliciviruses 
responsible for epidemic outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis worldwide. Because 
of the lack of a cell culture system or an animal model for this virus, studies 
on drinking water treatment such as separation and disinfection processes are 
still hampered. In the present study, we investigated NV removal performance as 
particles during a coagulation-ceramic microfiltration (MF) process by using 
recombinant NV virus-like particles (rNV-VLPs), which are morphologically and 
antigenically similar to native NV. We also experimentally investigated the 
behaviors of two widely accepted surrogates for pathogenic waterborne viruses, 
bacteriophages Qbeta and MS2, for comparison with the behavior of rNV-VLPs. More 
than 4-log removal was observed for rNV-VLPs with a 1.08 mg-Al/L dose of 
polyaluminium chloride in the coagulation-ceramic MF process. This high removal 
ratio of rNV-VLPs satisfies the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency requirement 
of 4-log removal or inactivation. In addition, the removal ratios of Qbeta and 
MS2 were approximately 2-log and 1-log, smaller than the ratio of rNV-VLPs. 
Accordingly, both bacteriophages have the potential to become appropriate 
surrogates for native NV in the coagulation-ceramic MF process, and, of the two, 
Qbeta is the more conservative surrogate.

In MRI, anatomical structures are most often differentiated by variations in 
their bulk magnetic properties. Alternatively, exogenous contrast agents can be 
attached to chemical moieties that confer affinity to molecular targets; the 
distribution of such contrast agents can be imaged by magnetic resonance. 
Xenon-based molecular sensors are molecular imaging agents that rely on the 
reversible exchange of hyperpolarized xenon between the bulk and a specifically 
targeted host-guest complex. We have incorporated approximately 125 xenon sensor 
molecules in the interior of an MS2 viral capsid, conferring multivalency and 
other properties of the viral capsid to the sensor molecule. The resulting 
signal amplification facilitates the detection of sensor at 0.7 pM, the lowest 
to date for any molecular imaging agent used in magnetic resonance. This 
amplification promises the detection of chemical targets at much lower 
concentrations than would be possible without the capsid scaffold.

Medicine, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag and genomic RNA determinants 
required for encapsidation are well established, but where and when 
encapsidation occurs in the cell is unknown. We constructed MS2 phage coat 
protein labeling systems to track spatial dynamics of primate and nonprimate 
lentiviral genomic RNAs (HIV-1 and feline immunodeficiency virus [FIV]) 
vis-à-vis their Gag proteins in live cells. Genomic RNAs of both lentiviral 
genera were observed to traffic into the cytoplasm, and this was Rev dependent. 
In transit, FIV Gag and genomic RNA accumulated independently of each other at 
the nuclear envelope, and focal colocalizations of genomic RNA with an intact 
packaging signal (psi) and Gag were observed to extend outward from the 
cytoplasmic face. In contrast, although HIV-1 genomic RNA was detected at the 
nuclear envelope, HIV-1 Gag was not. For both lentiviruses, genomic RNAs were 
seen at the plasma membrane if and only if Gag was present and psi was intact. 
In addition, HIV-1 and FIV genomes accumulated with Gag in late endosomal foci, 
again, only psi dependently. Thus, lentiviral genomic RNAs require specific Gag 
binding to accumulate at the plasma membrane, packaged genomes cointernalize 
with Gag into the endosomal pathway, and plasma membrane RNA incorporation by 
Gag does not trigger committed lentiviral particle egress from the cell. Based 
on the FIV results, we hypothesize that the Gag-genome association may initiate 
at the nuclear envelope.

The effect of cranberry juice (CJ) and cranberry proanthocyanidins (PAC) on the 
infectivity of human enteric virus surrogates, murine norovirus (MNV-1), feline 
calicivirus (FCV-F9), MS2(ssRNA) bacteriophage, and phiX-174(ssDNA) 
bacteriophage was studied. Viruses at high (approximately 7 log(10) PFU/ml) or 
low (approximately 5 log(10) PFU/ml) titers were mixed with equal volumes of CJ, 
0.30, 0.60, and 1.20 mg/ml final PAC concentration, or water and incubated for 1 
h at room temperature. Viral infectivity after treatments was evaluated using 
standardized plaque assays. At low viral titers, FCV-F9 was undetectable after 
exposure to CJ or the three tested PAC solutions. MNV-1 was reduced by 2.06 
log(10) PFU/ml with CJ, and 2.63, 2.75, and 2.95 log(10) PFU/ml with 0.15, 0.30, 
and 0.60 mg/ml PAC, respectively. MS2 titers were reduced by 1.14 log(10) PFU/ml 
with CJ, and 0.55, 0.80, and 0.96 log(10) PFU/ml with 0.15, 0.30, and 0.60 mg/ml 
PAC, respectively. phi-X174 titers were reduced by 1.79 log(10) PFU/ml with CJ, 
and 1.95, 3.67, and 4.98 log(10) PFU/ml with PAC at 0.15, 0.30, and 0.60 mg/ml, 
respectively. Experiments using high titers showed similar trends but with 
decreased effects. CJ and PAC show promise as natural antivirals that could 
potentially be exploited for foodborne viral illness treatment and prevention.

from soil.

Nucleic acid extraction is a critical step in the detection of an unknown 
biological agent. However, success can vary depending on the isolation and 
identification methods chosen and the difficulty of extraction from 
environmental matrices. In this work, bacteriophage MS2 RNA was extracted from 
three soil matrices, sand, clay, and loam, using five commercially available 
kits: the PowerSoil Total RNA Isolation, E.Z.N.A. Soil RNA, FastRNA Pro 
Soil-Direct, FastRNA Pro Soil-Indirect, and IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path kits. Success 
of the isolation was determined using an MS2-specific RT-PCR assay. The 
reproducibility and sensitivity of each method in the hands of both experienced 
and novice users were assessed and compared. Cost, operator time, and storage 
conditions were also considered in the evaluation. The RNA isolation method that 
yielded the best results, as defined by reproducibility and sensitivity, was the 
E.Z.N.A. Soil RNA kit for sand, the IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path Sample Purification 
kit for clay, and the FastRNA Pro Soil-Indirect kit for loam. However, if time 
and storage conditions are important considerations, the IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path 
kit may be appropriate for use with all soils since the kit has the shortest 
processing time and fewest temperature requirements.

of enteric viruses.

The objective of this study was to characterize the role of milk components in 
the recovery of viral particles from raw milk. For such characterization, four 
model milk formulations (A-D) were constituted by mixing different combinations 
of lactose, whey protein, casein, and fat into water. Each model formulation was 
spiked with six concentrations of bacteriophage MS2. The soluble and insoluble 
components of each model milk formulation were separated by centrifugation at 
40,000 x g and viruses were enumerated in each supernatant fluid and pellet by 
the double agar layer (DAL) method. When samples were spiked with MS2 at 
concentrations lower than 4.8 x 10(5) pfu/ml, milk components did not 
significantly impact the overall recovery. However, the impact of milk 
components was measurable at higher concentrations. In general, higher numbers 
of MS2 were recovered from supernatant fluids of model milk formulations 
containing no fat. The highest number of viral particles were recovered from the 
pellet of model C (lactose+whey protein+casein). The recovery efficiency of MS2 
was correlated with the dry matter contents of each model milk formulation and 
the initial spiking concentration of coliphage using response surface modeling.

Adsorption and desorption of viruses onto and from an adsorbent may have a 
dominant role in evaluating removal efficiency of a material. This study 
evaluated the effectiveness of a red soil from south part of China to remove two 
viruses, MS2 and phiX174, by adsorption from dilute aqueous solutions using a 
set of equilibrium and kinetic batch experiments. The effect of presence/absence 
of autochthonous microorganisms was also investigated. The results showed that 
when the autochthonous microorganisms were present, the red soil adsorbed more 
than 99.95% of MS2 and 98.23% of phiX174, in which most of them were inactivated 
and/or irreversibly adsorbed. Sterilization led to an increase in MS2 
adsorption, while decreased the adsorption of phiX174, indicating that 
sterilization-induced virus adsorption is virus type dependent. Fewer viruses 
could be desorbed from the sterilized soil as compared to the nonsterilized 
soil, probably because sterilization led to an increase in the strength of 
adsorption force between the soil and viruses. Though the overall virus removal 
efficiency by the red soil was less than the USPEA required value of 99.99%, we 
suggest the potential of the red soil as a starting material in removing water 
heavily polluted with viruses.

University of Patras, 26500 Patras, Greece.

Bacteriophage MS2 and PhiX174 were used as surrogates for human viruses in order 
to investigate the interaction between viruses and clay particles. The selected 
phyllosilicate clays were kaolinite and bentonite (>90% montmorillonite). A 
series of static and dynamic experiments were conducted at two different 
temperatures (4 and 25 degrees C) to investigate the effect of temperature and 
agitation (dynamic experiments) on virus adsorption onto clays. Appropriate 
adsorption isotherms were determined. Electrokinetic features of bacteriophages 
and clays were quantified at different pH and ionic strength (IS). Moreover, 
interaction energies between viruses and clays were calculated for the 
experimental conditions (pH 7 and IS = 2 mM) by applying the DLVO theory. The 
experimental results shown that virus adsorption increases linearly with 
suspended virus concentration. The observed distribution coefficient (K(d)) was 
higher for MS2 than PhiX174. The observed K(d) values were higher for the 
dynamic than static experiments, and increased with temperature. The results of 
this study provided basic information for the effectiveness of clays to remove 
viruses by adsorption from dilute aqueous solutions. No previous study has 
explored the combined effect of temperature and agitation on virus adsorption 
onto clays.

Low-dose irradiation improves microbial quality and shelf life of fresh mint 
(Mentha piperita L.) without compromising visual quality.

The effects of low-dose irradiation (0.25 to 2 kGy) and postirradiation storage 
(at 4 degrees C) on microbial and visual quality, color values (L*, a*, b*, 
chroma, and hue [ degrees ]), and chlorophyll content (Chl a, Chl b, and total 
Chl) of fresh mint were evaluated. Samples inoculated with E. coli O157:H7, 
Salmonella, and MS2 bacteriophage were irradiated and evaluated. E. coli O157:H7 
and Salmonella populations were reduced by 2 to 2.4, 3.5, and 5.8 log CFU/g, 
respectively, 1 d after treatment with 0.25, 0.60, and 1 kGy, respectively, and 
were completely eliminated at 2 kGy. None of the irradiation doses (P < 0.0001) 
reduced MS2 bacteriophage populations by more than 0.60 log PFU/g. Irradiation 
doses did not affect visual quality and samples remained of excellent to good 
quality (score 7.75 to 9) for up to 9 d of storage. Irradiation at 0.60, 1, and 
2 kGy increased (P < 0.0001) Chl a, Chl b, and total Chl. Both total Chl and Chl 
a decreased significantly after 3 d of storage. Significant decreases in Chl b 
were not observed until day 12 of storage. Color values (L*, b*, and chroma) 
were not significantly different until day 6 of storage and hue ( degrees ) 
remained unchanged (179 degrees ) for the entire storage period of 12 d. 
Overall, irradiation did not change L*, a*, b*, or chroma. These results 
demonstrate that irradiation of fresh mint at 2 kGy has the potential to improve 
its microbial quality and extend its shelf life without compromising its visual 
quality and color.
PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Mints and other raw fresh herbs are widely used for 
flavoring as well as garnish in a variety of dishes without further cooking. 
However, mint is one considered as one of the high-risk herbs when it comes to 
microbial contamination. We have evaluated the use of gamma irradiation 
treatment at very low doses ranging from 0 to 2 kGy to eliminate seeded 
Salmonella spp, E. coli O157:H7, and MS2 bacteriophage, a surrogate of hepatitis 
A virus. We found that low-dose irradiation (1.0 to 2.0 kGy) appears to be a 
promising method for improving the microbiological quality of fresh mint without 
compromising its visual and color attributes. This method may be applied to many 
popular fresh culinary herbs that are commonly used as garnishes in Asian 
cuisine.

Biofilms colonizing pipe surfaces of drinking water distribution systems could 
provide habitat and shelter for pathogenic viruses present in the water phase. 
This study aims (i) to develop a method to detect viral particles present in a 
drinking water biofilm and (ii) to study viral interactions with drinking water 
biofilms. A pilot scale system was used to develop drinking water biofilms on 3 
materials (7 cm(2) discs): PVC, cast iron and cement. Biofilms were inoculated 
with viral model including MS2, PhiX174 or adenovirus. Five techniques were 
tested to recover virus from biofilms. The most efficient uses beef extract and 
glycine at pH = 9. After sonication and centrifugation, the pH of the 
supernatant is neutralized prior to viral analysis. The calculated recovery 
rates varied from 29.3 to 74.6% depending on the virus (MS2 or PhiX174) and the 
material. Applying this protocol, the interactions of virus models (MS2 and 
adenovirus) with drinking water biofilms were compared. Our results show that 
adsorption of viruses to biofilms depends on their isoelectric points, the disc 
material and the hydrodynamic conditions. Applying hydrodynamic conditions 
similar to those existing in drinking water networks resulted in a viral 
adsorption corresponding to less than 1% of the initial viral load.

The impact of viral RNA on the association rates of capsid protein assembly: 
bacteriophage MS2 as a case study.

A large number of single-stranded RNA viruses, which form a major class of all 
viruses, co-assemble their protein container and their genomic material. The 
multiple roles of the viral genome in this process are presently only partly 
understood. Recent experimental results indicate that RNA, in addition to its 
function as a repository for genetic information, could play important 
functional roles during the assembly of the viral protein containers. An 
investigation of the impact of genomic RNA on the association of the protein 
subunits may therefore provide further insights into the mechanism of virus 
assembly. We study here the impact of viral RNA on the association rates of the 
capsid proteins during virus assembly. As a case study, we consider the viral 
capsid of bacteriophage MS2, which is formed from 60 asymmetric (AB) and 30 
symmetric (CC) protein dimers. Using Brownian dynamics simulations, we 
investigate the effect of the binding of an RNA stem-loop (the translational 
repressor) on the association rates of the capsid protein dimers. Our analysis 
shows that translational repressor binding results in self-association of AB 
dimers being inhibited, whilst association of AB with CC dimers is greatly 
enhanced. This provides an explanation for experimental results in which an 
alternating assembly pattern of AB and CC dimer addition to the growing assembly 
intermediate has been observed to be the dominant mode of assembly. The presence 
of the RNA hence dramatically decreases the number of dominant assembly pathways 
and thereby reduces the complexity of the self-assembly process of these 
viruses.

Impact of solution chemistry on viral removal by a single-walled carbon nanotube 
filter.

University, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.

This study investigates the effectiveness of a single-walled carbon nanotube 
(SWNT) filter for removal of viruses from water. MS2 bacteriophage viral removal 
was examined over a range of environmentally relevant solution chemistries, 
spanning various ionic strengths, monovalent and divalent salts, pH, and natural 
organic matter (NOM) concentrations. Viral removal by the SWNT filter was 
governed by physicochemical (depth) filtration. The removal of viruses increased 
at higher ionic strengths (NaCl) due to suppression of repulsive electrostatic 
interactions between viruses and SWNTs. Addition of divalent salts, however, had 
varying impacts. While CaCl(2) increased virus removal, likely due to 
complexation of calcium ions to viral surfaces, addition of MgCl(2) reduced 
viral removal by the SWNT filter. Solution pH also had significant impact on 
viral removal as the interactions between viral particles and SWNTs changed from 
attractive below the virus isoelectric point (about pH 3.9) to repulsive at 
higher pH. Suwannee River NOM was shown to be detrimental to filter viral 
removal. Reduction of viral removal by NOM was attributed to adsorption of NOM 
macromolecules to viruses and SWNTs, thereby resulting in steric repulsive 
forces. Modifications of the filter to incorporate thicker SWNT layers mitigate 
the negative impacts of NOM on filter performance. This study has shown that 
while it is possible to attain high levels of viral removal over a broad range 
of solution chemistries, the extent of viral removal will be highly dependent on 
the specific solution chemistry of the treated water.

Immobilization and one-dimensional arrangement of virus capsids with nanoscale 
precision using DNA origami.

DNA origami was used as a scaffold to arrange spherical virus capsids into 
one-dimensional arrays with precise nanoscale positioning. To do this, we first 
modified the interior surface of bacteriophage MS2 capsids with fluorescent dyes 
as a model cargo. An unnatural amino acid on the external surface was then 
coupled to DNA strands that were complementary to those extending from origami 
tiles. Two different geometries of DNA tiles (rectangular and triangular) were 
used. The capsids associated with tiles of both geometries with virtually 100% 
efficiency under mild annealing conditions, and the location of capsid 
immobilization on the tile could be controlled by the position of the probe 
strands. The rectangular tiles and capsids could then be arranged into 
one-dimensional arrays by adding DNA strands linking the corners of the tiles. 
The resulting structures consisted of multiple capsids with even spacing 
(approximately 100 nm). We also used a second set of tiles that had probe 
strands at both ends, resulting in a one-dimensional array of alternating 
capsids and tiles. This hierarchical self-assembly allows us to position the 
virus particles with unprecedented control and allows the future construction of 
integrated multicomponent systems from biological scaffolds using the power of 
rationally engineered DNA nanostructures.

Inactivation of human enteric virus surrogates by high-intensity ultrasound.

Su X(1), Zivanovic S, D'Souza DH.

(1)Department of Food Science and Technology, University of Tennessee, 
Knoxville, Tennessee 37996, USA.

Foodborne viruses, especially human noroviruses, are recognized as leading 
causes of nonbacterial gastroenteritis worldwide. Development of effective 
inactivation methods is of great importance to control their spread. In this 
study, the effect of high-intensity ultrasound (HIUS) on the infectivity of 
three foodborne virus surrogates was investigated. The three surrogates, murine 
norovirus (MNV-1), feline calicivirus (FCV-F9), and MS2 bacteriophage, were 
diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or orange juice to a titer of 
approximately 6 log(10) PFU/mL or approximately 4 log(10) PFU/mL. The ultrasound 
treatment was performed in duplicate by immersing the HIUS probe in 
virus-containing solution that was cooled in ice-water and sonicated at 20 kHz 
for 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 min with 30 sec on and 30 sec off. The infectivity 
of the recovered viruses after each ultrasound treatment was evaluated in 
duplicate using standardized plaque assays and compared to untreated controls. 
The results show that HIUS effectiveness depended on the virus type, the initial 
titer of the viruses, and the virus suspension solution. At titers of 
approximately 4 log(10) PFU/mL in PBS, feline calicivirus (FCV)-F9, MS2, and 
murine norovirus (MNV)-1 required 5-, 10-, and 30-min treatment, respectively, 
for complete inactivation. At initial titers of approximately 4 log(10) PFU/mL 
in orange juice, FCV-F9 required a 15-min treatment for complete inactivation 
and only a 1.55 log(10) PFU/mL reduction was achieved for MNV-1 in orange juice 
after 30-min treatment. Thus, inactivation by HIUS in orange juice was much 
lower than in PBS. Experiments using titers of approximately 6 log(10) PFU/mL 
showed decreased effects compared to those using titers of approximately 4 
log(10) PFU/mL. These results indicate that HIUS alone is not sufficient to 
inactivate virus in food. Hurdle technologies that combine HIUS with 
antimicrobials, heat, or pressure should be explored for viral inactivation.

Probing the intracellular proteome of Thermotoga maritima and 
Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus in pure and co-culture affords a global 
investigation into the machinery and mechanisms enduring inside the bacterial 
thermophilic cell at the time of harvest. The second of a two part study, 
employing GeLC-MS(2) a variety of proteins were confidently identified with <1% 
false discovery rate, and spectral counts for label-free relative quantification 
afforded indication of the dynamic proteome as a function of environmental 
stimuli. Almost 25% of the T. maritima proteome and 10% of the C. 
saccharolyticus proteome were identified. Through comparison of growth 
temperatures for T. maritima, a protein associated with chemotaxis was uniquely 
present in the sample cultivated at the non-optimal growth temperature. It is 
suspected that movement was induced due to the non-optimal condition as the 
organism may need to migrate in the culture to locate more nutrients. The 
inventory of C. saccharolyticus proteins identified in these studies and 
attributed to spectral counting, demonstrated that two CRISPR-associated 
proteins had increased expression in the pure culture versus the co-culture. 
Further focusing on this relationship, a C. saccharolyticus phage-shock protein 
was identified in the co-culture expanding a scenario that the co-culture had 
decreased antiviral resistance and accordingly an infection-related protein was 
present. Alterations in growth conditions of these bacterial thermophilic 
microorganisms offer a glimpse into the intricacy of microbial behavior and 
interaction.

Noroviruses are important causes of gastroenteritis; however, due to a lack of 
sensitive detection methods, the distinct role of contaminated food in norovirus 
outbreaks remains unclear. Two published virus extraction procedures combined 
with real-time RT-PCR for the detection of norovirus from food inoculated 
experimentally were compared. The elution-precipitation method was most 
efficient in all food matrices tested showing detection limits of 20 RT-PCRU for 
lettuce and ham, and 200 RT-PCRU for raspberries. The average recovery rates 
were 23%, 7% and 24% for lettuce, raspberries and ham, respectively. The 
ultrafiltration method yielded detection limits of 200 RT-PCRU for lettuce and 
ham, and 2000 RT-PCRU for raspberries; recovery rates were 9%, 7%, 3%, 
respectively. Subsequently, food items implicated in a norovirus outbreak were 
examined by the elution-precipitation method. Virus recovery rates determined by 
using MS2 phage ranged from 1 to 20% depending on the food matrix. However, 
norovirus could not be detected in the food items examined. This negative result 
may be explained by a low virus titer and heterogeneous virus distribution, or 
by random selection of food samples that contained no norovirus. Both, proper 
sampling and virus extraction from foods may be improved further to identify 
vehicles of infection.

Many single-stranded RNA viruses self-assemble their protein containers around 
their genomes. The roles that the RNA plays in this assembly process have mostly 
been ignored, resulting in a protein-centric view of assembly that is unable to 
explain adequately the fidelity and speed of assembly in such viruses. Using 
bacteriophage MS2, we demonstrate here via a combination of mass spectrometry 
and kinetic modelling how viral RNA can bias assembly towards only a small 
number of the many possible assembly pathways, thus increasing assembly 
efficiency. Assembly reactions have been studied in vitro using phage coat 
protein dimers, the known building block of the T=3 shell, and short RNA 
stem-loops based on the translational operator of the replicase cistron, a 19 nt 
fragment (TR). Mass spectrometry has unambiguously identified two on-pathway 
intermediates in such reactions that have stoichiometry consistent with 
formation of either a particle 3-fold or 5-fold axis. These imply that there are 
at least two sub-pathways to the final capsid. The flux through each pathway is 
controlled by the length of the RNA stem-loop triggering the assembly reaction 
and this effect can be understood in structural terms. The kinetics of 
intermediate formation have been studied and show steady-state concentrations 
for intermediates between starting materials and the T=3 shell, consistent with 
an assembly process in which all the steps are in equilibrium. These data have 
been used to derive a kinetic model of the assembly reaction that in turn allows 
us to determine the dominant assembly pathways explicitly, and to estimate the 
effect of the RNA on the free energy of association between the assembling 
protein subunits. The results reveal that there are only a small number of 
dominant assembly pathways, which vary depending on the relative ratios of RNA 
and protein. These results suggest that the genomic RNA plays significant roles 
in defining the precise assembly sub-pathway followed to create the final 
capsid.

The relative transport and attenuation of bacteria, bacteriophages, and bromide 
was determined in a 5m long x 0.3m diameter column of saturated pea gravel. The 
velocity (V), longitudinal dispersivity (alpha(x)) and total removal rate 
(lambda) were calculated from the breakthrough curves at 1m, 3m, and 5m, at a 
flow rate of 32Lh(-1). Inactivation (mu) rates were determined in survival 
chambers. Two pure culture experiments with Escherichia coli J6-2 and F-RNA 
phage MS2 produced an overall V ranking of E. coli J6-2>MS2>bromide, consistent 
with velocity enhancement, whereby larger particles progressively move into 
faster, central streamlines of saturated pores. Removal rates were near zero for 
MS2, but were higher for E. coli J6-2. In two sewage experiments, E. coli and 
F-RNA phage Vs were similar (but > bromide). This was attributed to phage 
adsorption to colloids similar in size to E. coli cells. Sewage phage removal 
rates were higher than for the pure MS2 cultures. The application of filtration 
theory suggested that, whereas free phage were unaffected by settling, this was 
the primary removal mechanism for the colloid-associated phage. However, 
cultured and sewage E. coli removal rates were similar, suggesting the dominance 
of free E. coli cells in the sewage. When MS2 was attached to kaolin particles, 
it was transported faster than free MS2, but at similar rates to sewage phage. 
The mu values indicated little contribution of inactivation to removal of either 
cultured or sewage microorganisms. The results showed the importance of 
association with colloids in determining the relative transport of bacteria and 
viruses in gravels.

Virucidal properties of metal oxide nanoparticles and their halogen adducts.

Häggström J(1), Balyozova D, Klabunde KJ, Marchin G.

Selected metal oxide nanoparticles are capable of strongly adsorbing large 
amounts of halogens (Cl(2), Br, I(2)) and mixed halogens. These solid adducts 
are relatively stable thermally, and they can be stored for long periods. 
However, in the open environment, they are potent biocides. Herein are described 
studies with a number of bacteriophage MS2, phiX174, and PRD-1 (virus examples). 
PRD-1 is generally more resistant to chemical disinfection, but in this paper it 
is shown to be very susceptible to selected interhalogen and iodine adducts of 
CeO(2), Al(2)O(3), and TiO(2) nanoparticles. Overall, the halogen adducts of 
TiO(2) and Al(2)O(3) were most effective. The mechanism of disinfection by these 
nanoparticles is not completely clear, but could include abrasive properties, as 
well as oxidative powers. A hypothesis that nanoparticles damage virons or stick 
to them and prevent binding to the host cell is a consideration that needs to be 
explored. Herein are reported comparative biocidal activities of a series of 
adducts and electron microscope images of before and after treatment.

Studies, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.

AIMS: Virus transfer between individuals and fomites is an important route of 
transmission for both gastrointestinal and respiratory illness. The present 
study examines how direction of transfer, virus species, time since last 
handwashing, gender, and titre affect viral transfer between fingerpads and 
glass.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Six hundred fifty-six total transfer events, performed by 
20 volunteers using MS2, φX174, and fr indicated 0·23 ± 0·22 (mean and standard 
deviation) of virus is readily transferred on contact. Virus transfer is 
significantly influenced by virus species and time since last handwashing. 
Transfer of fr bacteriophage is significantly higher than both MS2 and φX174. 
Virus transfer between surfaces is reduced for recently washed hands.
CONCLUSIONS: Viruses are readily transferred between skin and surfaces on 
contact. The fraction of virus transferred is dependent on multiple factors 
including virus species, recently washing hands, and direction of transfer 
likely because of surface physicochemical interactions.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The study is the first to provide a large 
data set of virus transfer events describing the central tendency and 
distribution of fraction virus transferred between fingers and glass. The data 
set from the study, along with the quantified effect sizes of the factors 
explored, inform studies examining role of fomites in disease transmission.

Single-stranded RNA viruses package their genomes into capsids enclosing fixed 
volumes. We assayed the ability of bacteriophage MS2 coat protein to package 
large, defined fragments of its genomic, single-stranded RNA. We show that the 
efficiency of packaging into a T=3 capsid in vitro is inversely proportional to 
RNA length, implying that there is a free-energy barrier to be overcome during 
assembly. All the RNAs examined have greater solution persistence lengths than 
the internal diameter of the capsid into which they become packaged, suggesting 
that protein-mediated RNA compaction must occur during assembly. Binding 
ethidium bromide to one of these RNA fragments, which would be expected to 
reduce its flexibility, severely inhibited packaging, consistent with this idea. 
Cryo-EM structures of the capsids assembled in these experiments with the 
sub-genomic RNAs show a layer of RNA density beneath the coat protein shell but 
lack density for the inner RNA shell seen in the wild-type virion. The inner 
layer is restored when full-length virion RNA is used in the assembly reaction, 
implying that it becomes ordered only when the capsid is filled, presumably 
because of the effects of steric and/or electrostatic repulsions. The cryo-EM 
results explain the length dependence of packaging. In addition, they show that 
for the sub-genomic fragments the strongest ordered RNA density occurs below the 
coat protein dimers forming the icosahedral 5-fold axes of the capsid. There is 
little such density beneath the proteins at the 2-fold axes, consistent with our 
model in which coat protein dimers binding to RNA stem-loops located at sites 
throughout the genome leads to switching of their preferred conformations, thus 
regulating the placement of the quasi-conformers needed to build the T=3 capsid. 
The data are consistent with mutual chaperoning of both RNA and coat protein 
conformations, partially explaining the ability of such viruses to assemble so 
rapidly and accurately.

Visible light sensitized inactivation of MS-2 bacteriophage by a cationic 
amine-functionalized C60 derivative.

Recently, we reported the successful synthesis of various hexakis C60 
derivatives (i.e., C60 with six functional groups containing NH3+-, CO2H-, or 
OH-terminals) with enhanced stability in water for aqueous phase application 
(Lee et al., Environ. Sci. Technol. 2009, 43, pp 6604-6610). Among these newly 
synthesized C60 derivatives, the cationic hexakis C60 derivative with amine 
functionality, C60(CR2)6 (R=CO2(CH2)2NH3+CF3CO2-), was found to exhibit 
remarkable efficiency to inactivate Escherichia coli and MS-2 bacteriophage 
under UVA irradiation. Herein, we report that this amine-functionalized C60 
derivative is also photoactive in response to visible light from both commercial 
fluorescence lamps and sunlight. Efficient production of 1O2, facile reaction of 
1O2 with proteins in MS-2 phage capsid and electrostatic attraction between 
positively charged C60 derivative and negatively charged MS-2 phage collectively 
contributed to high efficiency of MS-2 phage inactivation in this photocatalytic 
disinfection system. The rate of 1O2 production was evaluated using a probe 
compound, furfuryl alcohol, and 1O2 CT (the product of 1O2 concentration and 
exposure time) required to achieve a target level of virus inactivation was 
quantitatively analyzed. The unique visible-light sensitized virucidal property 
makes this C60 derivative highly desirable for the development of sustainable 
disinfection strategies that do not require continuous chemical addition nor an 
external energy source other than ambient light.

Opening the closed ribosome-binding site of the lysis cistron of bacteriophage 
MS2.

In prokaryotes gene expression is mainly regulated at the levels of 
transcription and translation. An important form of translational control 
operates at the initiation of protein synthesis. For instance the translation of 
an existing mRNA can be prevented by features in the mRNA structure that 
prohibit binding of ribosomes. This type of control is frequently applied to 
polycistronic mRNA to forestall translation of a downstream cistron until the 5' 
neighbouring cistron has been read (1-7). Such translational coupling or 
sequential reading also facilitates the shutting off of several cistrons from 
one control point(6). An interesting example of a nontranslatable message is the 
lysis (L) cistron, present as an overlapping gene in the RNA bacteriophage MS2 
(refs 8-10; Fig. 1). The start of the L cistron is not directly accessible to 
ribosomes. Instead its translation is strictly coupled to the passage of 
ribosomes over the preceding coat cistron(2). We have now analysed which 
features in the MS2 RNA structure deny ribosomes access to the start of the L 
message. We report here that small deletions, introduced about 40 nucleotides 5' 
to the start codon of the L gene, remove the initiation barrier and open the 
cistron to independent translation. An RNA secondary structure accounting for 
the closed state of the ribosome binding site is proposed.

Human virus and bacteriophage inactivation in clear water by simulated sunlight 
compared to bacteriophage inactivation at a southern California beach.

Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720, USA. dlove@jhsph.edu

Few quantitative data exist on human virus inactivation by sunlight and the 
relationship between human and indicator viruses under sunlit conditions. We 
investigated the effects of sunlight on human viruses (adenovirus type 2, 
poliovirus type 3) and bacteriophages (MS2, Q-Beta SP, Fi, M13, PRD1, Phi-X174, 
and coliphages isolated from Avalon Bay, California). Viruses were inoculated 
into phosphate buffered saline or seawater, exposed to a laboratory solar 
simulator for ≤12 h, and enumerated by double agar layer or cell culture to 
derive first-order inactivation rate constants (k(obs), h(-1)). The viruses most 
resistant to sunlight were adenovirus type 2 (k(obs)= 0.59 ± 0.04 h(-1)) and 
bacteriophage MS2 (k(obs)= 0.43 ± 0.02 h(-1)), which suggests MS2 may be a 
conservative indicator for sunlight resistant human viruses in clear water when 
sunlight inactivation is the main removal mechanism. Reasonable agreement was 
observed between somatic coliphage inactivation rates measured in the solar 
simulator (k(mean) = 1.81 h(-1)) and somatic coliphages measured in the surf 
zone during a field campaign at Avalon Bay during similar sunlight intensity (k 
= 0.75 h(-1) at log-RMSE minimum; k(range) = 0.54 h(-1) to >1.88 h(-1); Boehm, 
A. B. et al. Environ. Sci. Technol. 2009, 43, (21), 8046-8052). Hence, measuring 
sunlight inactivation rates of viruses in the laboratory can be used to estimate 
inactivation in the environment under similar sunlight and water quality 
conditions.

Carbon nanotubes-based chemiresistive biosensors for detection of 
microorganisms.

The paper reports carbon nanotube (CNT)-based immunosensors for the detection of 
two types of microorganisms, bacteria and viruses. The pathogen Escherichia coli 
O157:H7 and the bacteriophage T7 were selected as model for bacteria and 
viruses, respectively, while E. coli K12 and the bacteriophage MS2 were used to 
assess the selectivity of the biosensor. The transduction element consisted of 
single-walled carbon nanotubes aligned in parallel bridging two gold electrodes 
to function as a chemiresistive biosensor. Single-walled carbon nanotubes 
(SWNTs) were functionalized with specific antibodies (Ab) for the different 
microorganisms by covalent immobilization to the non-covalently bound 1-pyrene 
butanoic acid succinimidyl ester. A significant increase in the resistance of 
the device was observed when the biosensor was exposed to E. coli O157:H7 whole 
cells or lysates with a limit of detection of 10(5) and 10(3) CFU (colony 
forming units)/mL, corresponding to 10(3) and 10(1) CFU/chip, respectively, 
while no response was observed when the biosensor was exposed to the E. coli 
K12. In the case of virus detection, a significant resistance increase was 
detected due to interaction of the bacteriophages with the Abs, with a limit of 
detection of 10(3) PFU/mL corresponding to 10(1)PFU/chip and excellent 
selectivity against MS2 bacteriophage. The sensor exhibited a fast response time 
of ∼5 min in the case of bacteriophage detection, while the response time for 
the detection of bacteria was 60 min.

Multiwalled carbon nanotube filter: improving viral removal at low pressure.

Haven, Connecticut 06520-8286, USA.

The effective removal of viruses by a multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWNT) filter 
is demonstrated over a range of solution chemistries. MS2 bacteriophage viral 
removal by the MWNT filter was between 1.5 and 3 log higher than that observed 
with a recently reported single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) filter when 
examined under similar loadings (0.3 mg/cm(2)) of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The 
greater removal of viruses by the MWNT filter is attributed to a more uniform 
CNT-filter matrix that allows effective removal of viruses by physicochemical 
(depth) filtration. Viral removal by the MWNT filter was examined under a broad 
range of water compositions (ionic strength, monovalent and divalent salts, 
solution pH, natural organic matter, alginate, phosphate, and bicarbonate) and 
filter approach velocities (0.0016, 0.0044, and 0.0072 cm/s). Log viral removal 
increased as the fluid approach velocity decreased, exhibiting a dependence on 
approach velocity in agreement with colloid filtration theory for Brownian 
particles. Viral removal improved with increasing ionic strength (NaCl), from 
5.06 log removal at 1 mM NaCl to greater than 6.56 log removal at 100 mM NaCl. 
Addition of calcium ions also enhanced viral removal, but the presence of 
magnesium ions resulted in a decrease in viral removal. Solution pH also played 
an important role in viral removal, with log removals of 8.13, 5.38, and 4.00 
being documented at solution pH values of 3.0, 5.5, and 9.0, respectively. 
Dissolved natural organic matter (NOM) had a negligible effect on viral removal 
at low concentration (1 mg/L), but higher concentrations of NOM significantly 
reduced the viral removal by the MWNT filter, likely due to steric repulsion. 
Addition of alginate (model polysaccharide) also caused a marked decrease in 
viral removal by the MWNT filter. This highly scalable MWNT-filter technology at 
gravity-driven pressures presents new, cost-effective options for point-of-use 
filters for viral removal.

Bacteriophage MS2 was used to construct a targeted, multivalent photodynamic 
therapy vehicle for the treatment of Jurkat leukemia T cells. The 
self-assembling spherical virus capsid was modified on the interior surface with 
up to 180 porphyrins capable of generating cytotoxic singlet oxygen upon 
illumination. The exterior of the capsid was modified with ∼20 copies of a 
Jurkat-specific aptamer using an oxidative coupling reaction targeting an 
unnatural amino acid. The capsids were able to target and selectively kill more 
than 76% of the Jurkat cells after only 20 min of illumination. Capsids modified 
with a control DNA strand did not target Jurkat cells, and capsids modified with 
the aptamer were found to be specific for Jurkat cells over U266 cells (a 
control B cell line). The doubly modified capsids were also able to kill Jurkat 
cells selectively even when mixed with erythrocytes, suggesting the possibility 
of using our system to target blood-borne cancers or other pathogens in the 
blood supply.

Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA. dlove@jhsph.edu

Filter-feeding bivalve mollusks (shellfish) can bioaccumulate pathogenic 
microorganisms in up to 1000-fold higher levels than overlying waters, and 
therefore disease risks are associated with consuming raw or partially cooked 
shellfish. Many of these shellfish-borne diseases are due to enteric bacteria 
and viruses associated with fecal contamination. To control shellfish-borne 
diseases, guidelines for shellfish harvest waters and shellfish meat have been 
devised, which include cleansing of contaminated shellfish by depuration in 
controlled systems, heat pasteurization, or relay to clean waters. This study 
examines the depuration of oysters (Crassostrea virginica) and hard shell clams 
(Mercinaria mercinaria) in a flow-through depuration system under variable 
temperature (12 °C, 18 °C, and 25 °C), salinity (8 ppt, 18 ppt, and 28 ppt), 
turbidity (<1NTU, 10NTU, and 20NTU), pH (pH 7 and pH 8), and algae conditions (0 
cells/mL and 50,000 cells/mL), with constant dissolved oxygen (5-7 mg/L). 
Oysters and hard shell clams were artificially contaminated with enteric 
microorganisms: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, coliphage MS2, 
Poliovirus type-1 and Hepatitis A virus HM-175 (HAV), then depurated in 5-day 
trials with daily sampling. In oysters, optimizing environmental parameters of 
water temperature improved E. coli, MS2, poliovirus and HAV depuration, and 
optimized salinity improved E. coli, E. faecalis, and MS2 depuration rates. In 
hard shell clams, salinity improved E. coli and E. faecalis depuration rates. 
Adjusting turbidity, pH or algae did not improve microorganism depuration in 
either oysters or hard shell clams, with the exception of turbidity on E. 
faecalis in hard shell clams. Microorganism depuration rates in oysters from 
greatest to least were: MS2>E. coli>E. faecalis>poliovirus>HAV, and in clams 
depuration rates from greatest to least were: E. coli>E. 
faecalis>HAV>MS2>poliovirus. Because E. coli and E. faecalis were removed at 
faster rates than HAV and poliovirus, these fecal bacteria appear to be poor 
process indicators of the virological quality of depurated oysters and hard 
shell clams.

Virus inactivation by silver doped titanium dioxide nanoparticles for drinking 
water treatment.

TX 77005, USA.

Photocatalytic inactivation of viruses and other microorganisms is a promising 
technology that has been increasingly utilized in recent years. In this study, 
photocatalytic silver doped titanium dioxide nanoparticles (nAg/TiO(2)) were 
investigated for their capability of inactivating Bacteriophage MS2 in aqueous 
media. Nano-sized Ag deposits were formed on two commercial TiO(2) nanopowders 
using a photochemical reduction method. The MS2 inactivation kinetics of 
nAg/TiO(2) was compared to the base TiO(2) material and silver ions leached from 
the catalyst. The inactivation rate of MS2 was enhanced by more than 5 fold 
depending on the base TiO(2) material, and the inactivation efficiency increased 
with increasing silver content. The increased production of hydroxyl free 
radicals was found to be responsible for the enhanced viral inactivation.

Lack of evidence for sign epistasis between beneficial mutations in an RNA 
bacteriophage.

In previous work (Betancourt, Genetics 181:1535, 2009), I propagated three large 
laboratory populations of an RNA phage (MS2) as they adapted to a controlled 
laboratory environment. These populations were large enough so that evolution 
might be expected to be mostly repeatable, but they nevertheless fixed different 
suites of mutations over the course of the experiment. Here, I investigate one 
possible explanation for these results: epistasis, in which the effect of a 
mutation depends on its genetic background, may have prevented populations with 
different initial substitutions from fixing the same set of subsequent 
mutations. I show that two mutations that previously occurred in different 
genetic backgrounds are beneficial on either background. This result suggests 
that sign epistasis-in which a mutation is beneficial on one background, but 
deleterious on another-is not the cause of different evolutionary trajectories 
observed in the Betancourt (2009) experiment. However, they can be explained by 
either magnitude epistasis-in which mutations have stronger or weaker beneficial 
effects depending on the background-or by the simultaneous fixation of multiple 
beneficial mutations. Surprisingly, the large populations of the previous 
experiment showed less parallel evolution than the small populations of this 
experiment, which lends support to the fixation of multiple beneficial mutations 
contributing to the patterns seen in both experiments.

Detection of specific genetic markers can rapidly identify the presence of 
enteric viruses in groundwater. However, comparison of stability characteristics 
between genetic and infectivity markers is necessary to better interpret 
molecular data. Human adenovirus serotype 2 (HAdV2), in conjunction with MS2 
phages or GA phages, was spiked into raw groundwater microcosms. Viral stability 
was periodically assessed by both infectivity and real-time PCR methods. The 
results of this yearlong study suggest that adenoviruses have the most stable 
persistence profile and an ability to survive for a long time in groundwater. 
According to a linear regression model, infectivity reductions of HAdV2 ranged 
from 0.0076 log(10)/day (4°C) to 0.0279 log(10)/day (20°C) and were 
significantly lower than those observed for phages. No adenoviral genome 
degradation was observed at 4°C, and the reduction was estimated at 0.0036 
log(10)/day at 20°C. Occurrence study showed that DNA of human adenoviruses 
could be observed in groundwater from a confined aquifer (7 of the 60 samples 
were positive by real-time PCR), while no fecal indicators were detected. In 
agreement with the persistence of genetic markers, the presence of adenoviral 
DNA in groundwater may be misleading in term of health risk, especially in the 
absence of information on the infective status.

Exposure of conjugative plasmid carrying Escherichia coli biofilms to 
male-specific bacteriophages.

Escherichia coli carrying a natural conjugative F-plasmid generates F-pili 
mating pairs, which is important for early biofilm formation. In this study, we 
investigated the effect of male-specific filamentous single stranded DNA 
bacteriophage (f1) and RNA bacteriophage (MS2) on the formation of biofilms by 
E. coli carrying a natural conjugative F-plasmid. We showed that the early 
biofilm formation was completely inhibited by addition of the f1 phage, but not 
the MS2 phage. This suggests that the tip of F-pili is the specific attachment 
site for mating pairs formation and the side of F-pili has a non-obligatory role 
during biofilm formation. The inhibitory effect of the f1 phage was dependent on 
the time of addition during the biofilm formation. No inhibitory effect was 
observed when the f1 phages were added to the mature biofilms. This resistant 
mechanism of the mature biofilms could be attributed to the biofilm-specific 
phenotypes representing that the F-pili mating pairs were already formed and 
then the curli production commenced during the biofilm maturation. The 
pre-formed mating pairs seemed to resist the f1 phages. Altogether, our results 
indicate a close relationship between the presence of conjugative plasmid and 
male-specific bacteriophages within sessile biofilm communities, as well as the 
possibility of using the male-specific bacteriophages to control biofilm 
formation.

PRD1.

Objectives of this work are to investigate effects of pH and ionic strength (IS) 
on virus transport in saturated soil and to develop a quantitative relationship 
for these effects. A series of 50-cm column experiments with clean quartz sand 
under saturated conditions and with pH values of 5, 6, 7, 8, and IS values of 1, 
10, and 20 mM were conducted. Bacteriophage PRD1 was used as a model virus. 
Applying a one-site kinetic model, attachment, detachment, and inactivation rate 
coefficients were determined from fitting breakthrough curves using the software 
package Hydrus-1D. Attachment rate coefficients increased with decreasing pH and 
increasing IS, in agreement with DLVO theory. Sticking efficiencies were 
calculated from the attachment rate coefficients and used to develop an 
empirical formula for sticking efficiency as a function of pH and IS. This 
relationship is applicable under unfavorable conditions for virus attachment. We 
compared sticking efficiencies predicted by the empirical formula with those 
from field and column experiments. Within the calibrated range of pH and IS, the 
predicted and observed sticking efficiencies are in reasonable agreement for 
bacteriophages PRD1 and MS2. However, the formula significantly overestimates 
sticking efficiencies for IS higher than 100 mM. In addition, it performs less 
well for viruses with different surface reactivity than PRD1 and MS2. Effects of 
pH and IS on detachment and inactivation rate coefficients were also 
investigated but the experimental results do not allow constraining these 
parameters with sufficient certainty.

A method to determine the available UV-C dose for the decontamination of 
filtering facepiece respirators.

Protective, Technology Laboratory, Pittsburgh, PA 15236, USA.

AIMS: To develop a method to assess model-specific parameters for ultraviolet-C 
(UV-C, 254 nm) decontamination of filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs).
METHODS AND RESULTS: UV-C transmittance was quantified for the distinct 
composite layers of six N95 FFR models and used to calculate model-specific 
α-values, the percentage of the surface UV-C irradiance available for the 
internal filtering medium (IFM). Circular coupons, excised from the FFRs, were 
exposed to aerosolized particles containing MS2 coliphage and treated with 
IFM-specific UV-C doses ranging from 38 to 4707 J m(-2). Models exposed to a 
minimum IFM dose of 1000 J m(-2) demonstrated at least a 3 log reduction (LR) in 
viable MS2. Model-specific exposure times to achieve this IFM dose ranged from 2 
to 266 min.
CONCLUSIONS: UV-C transmits into and through FFR materials. LR of MS2 was a 
function of model-specific IFM UV-C doses.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Filtering facepiece respirators are in 
high demand during infectious disease outbreaks, potentially leading to supply 
shortages. Reuse of disposable FFRs after decontamination has been discussed as 
a possible remediation strategy, but to date lacks supporting scientific 
evidence. The methods described here can be used to assess the likelihood that 
UV-C decontamination will be successful for specific FFR models.

We report development, characterization, and testing of chemiresistive 
immunosensors based on single polypyrrole (Ppy) nanowire for highly sensitive, 
specific, label free, and direct detection of viruses. Bacteriophages T7 and MS2 
were used as safe models for viruses for demonstration. Ppy nanowires were 
electrochemically polymerized into alumina template, and single nanowire based 
devices were assembled on a pair of gold electrodes by ac dielectrophoretic 
alignment and anchored using maskless electrodeposition. Anti-T7 or anti-MS2 
antibodies were immobilized on single Ppy nanowire using EDC-NHS chemistry to 
fabricate nanobiosensor for the detection of corresponding bacteriophage. The 
biosensors showed excellent sensitivity with a lower detection limit of 10(-3) 
plaque forming unit (PFU) in 10 mM phosphate buffer, wide dynamic range and 
excellent selectivity. The immunosensors were successfully applied for the 
detection of phages in spiked untreated urban runoff water samples. The results 
show the potential of these sensors in health care, environmental monitoring, 
food safety and homeland security for sensitive, specific, rapid, and affordable 
detection of bioagents/pathogens.

Bacteriophage MS2 is widely used as a surrogate to estimate pathogenic virus 
elimination by membrane filtration processes used in water treatment. Given that 
this water technology may be conducted with different types of waters, we 
focused on investigating the effects of ionic strength on MS2 behavior. For 
this, MS2 was analyzed while suspended in solutions of various ionic strengths, 
first in a batch experiment and second during membrane ultrafiltration, and 
quantified using (i) quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), which 
detects the total number of viral genomes, (ii) qRT-PCR without the RNA 
extraction step, which reflects only particles with a broken capsid (free RNA), 
and (iii) the PFU method, which detects only infectious viruses. At the 
beginning of the batch experiments using solutions containing small amounts of 
salts, losses of MS2 infectivity (90%) and broken particles (20%) were observed; 
these proportions did not change during filtration. In contrast, in 
high-ionic-strength solutions, bacteriophage kept its biological activity under 
static conditions, but it quickly lost its infectivity during the filtration 
process. Increasing the ionic strength decreased both the inactivation and the 
capsid breakup in the feed suspension and increased the loss of infectivity in 
the filtration retentate, while the numbers of MS2 genomes were identical in 
both experiments. In conclusion, the effects of ionic strength on MS2 behavior 
may significantly distort the results of membrane filtration processes, and 
therefore, the combination of classical and molecular methods used here is 
useful for an effective validation of the retention efficiency of 
ultrafiltration membranes.

Haven, Connecticut 06520-8286, United States.

We describe the concept and demonstrate the efficacy of a novel SWNT-MWNT hybrid 
filter for the removal and inactivation of microbial pathogens from water. The 
filter is composed of a thin SWNT layer (0.05 mg cm(-2)) on top of a thicker 
MWNT layer (0.27 mg cm(-2)) supported by a microporous support membrane. The 
SWNT-MWNT filter exhibits high log removal of several model viruses (MS2, PRD1, 
and T4 bacteriophages) by depth filtration, which predominantly takes place in 
the thicker and more uniform MWNT layer. The filter removes all bacteria by a 
sieving mechanism, with the top SWNT layer providing high levels of inactivation 
of model bacteria (Escherichia coli K12 and Staphylococcus epidermidis), as well 
as microbes from river water and treated wastewater effluent. The dual-layer 
SWNT-MWNT filter lays the framework for new possibilities in point-of-use water 
filtration.

Investigating synergism during sequential inactivation of MS-2 phage and 
Bacillus subtilis spores with UV/H2O2 followed by free chlorine.

A sequential application of UV as a primary disinfectant with and without 
H(2)O(2) addition followed by free chlorine as secondary, residual disinfectant 
was performed to evaluate the synergistic inactivation of selected indicator 
microorganisms, MS-2 bacteriophage and Bacillus subtilis spores. No synergism 
was observed when the UV irradiation treatment was followed by free chlorine, 
i.e., the overall level of inactivation was the same as the sum of the 
inactivation levels achieved by each disinfection step. With the addition of 
H(2)O(2) in the primary UV disinfection step, however, enhanced microbial 
inactivation was observed. The synergism was observed in two folds manners: (1) 
additional inactivation achieved by hydroxyl radicals generated from the 
photolysis of H(2)O(2) in the primary UV disinfection step, and (2) damage to 
microorganisms in the primary step which facilitated the subsequent chlorine 
inactivation. Addition of H(2)O(2) in the primary disinfection step was also 
found to be beneficial for the degradation of selected model organic pollutants 
including bisphenol-A (endocrine disruptor), geosmin (taste and odor causing 
compound) and 2,4-D (herbicide). The results suggest that the efficiency of 
UV/free chlorine sequential disinfection processes, which are widely employed in 
drinking water treatment, could be significantly enhanced by adding H(2)O(2) in 
the primary step and hence converting the UV process to an advanced oxidation 
process.

Electrical discharge processes are emerging as water treatment technologies 
applicable to both the degradation of organic contaminants as well as 
inactivation of pathogens. Particularly as a disinfection technology, electrical 
discharge processes do not produce toxic byproducts, and effectively inactivate 
a wide spectrum of microorganisms by multiple lethal actions generated by the 
formation of plasma channels. This study demonstrates the inactivation of a 
virus using the streamer corona discharge process (SCDP) with MS2 phage as a 
surrogate. A rapid inactivation of MS2 phage (i.e., approximately 4 log 
inactivation in 5 min) was observed in all experimental runs conducted. 
Discharge conditions such as applied voltage and storage capacitance 
significantly affected the inactivation efficiency of MS2 phage, whereas the 
influence of water quality parameters was minor. In order to elucidate the 
mechanism of MS2 phage inactivation, potentially lethal factors that can be 
generated by the SCDP were selected, and their roles in the inactivation of MS2 
phage were examined. As a result, effects of UV radiation, chemical oxidants, 
and pulsed electric fields were found to be insignificant. The shockwave 
generated upon plasma channel formation appears to be the most important factor 
responsible for MS2 phage inactivation.

Inactivation of bacteriophage MS2 upon exposure to very low concentrations of 
chlorine dioxide.

Netherlands. luc.hornstra@kwrwater.nl

This study investigates the effects of very low concentrations of ClO(2) applied 
in drinking water practice on the inactivation of bacteriophage MS2. 
Concentrations of 0.5 mg/L, 0.1 mg/L and 0.02 mg/L ClO(2) inactivated at least 5 
log units of MS2 after an exposure time of approximately 20, 50 and 300 min 
respectively. When the ClO(2) concentration was as low as 0.005 mg/L, 
inactivation of 1 log unit MS2 was observed after 300 min exposure. Increasing 
the contact time to 24 h did not increase the inactivation any further. 
Non-linear inactivation kinetics (tailing) were observed for all conditions 
tested. Repeated addition of MS2 to the reactor showed that tailing was not 
caused by a reduction of the biocidal effect of ClO(2) during disinfection. The 
Modified Chick-Watson, the Efficiency Factor Hom (EFH) model and the Modified 
Cerf model, a modification of the two-fraction Cerf model, were fitted to the 
non-linear inactivation curves. Both the EFH and the modified Cerf model did fit 
accurately to the inactivation data of all experiments. The good fit of the 
Modified Cerf model supports the hypothesis of the presence of two 
subpopulations. Our study showed that ClO(2) is an effective disinfectant 
against model organism MS2, also at the low concentrations applied in water 
treatment practice. The inactivation kinetics followed a biphasic pattern due to 
the presence of a more ClO(2)-resistant subpopulation of MS2 phages, either 
caused by population heterogeneity or aggregation/adhesion of MS2.

An RNA Phage Lab: MS2 in Walter Fiers' laboratory of molecular biology in Ghent,

The importance of viruses as model organisms is well-established in molecular 
biology and Max Delbrück's phage group set standards in the DNA phage field. In 
this paper, I argue that RNA phages, discovered in the 1960s, were also 
instrumental in the making of molecular biology. As part of experimental 
systems, RNA phages stood for messenger RNA (mRNA), genes and genome. RNA was 
thought to mediate information transfers between DNA and proteins. Furthermore, 
RNA was more manageable at the bench than DNA due to the availability of 
specific RNases, enzymes used as chemical tools to analyse RNA. Finally, RNA 
phages provided scientists with a pure source of mRNA to investigate the genetic 
code, genes and even a genome sequence. This paper focuses on Walter Fiers' 
laboratory at Ghent University (Belgium) and their work on the RNA phage MS2. 
When setting up his Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Fiers planned a 
comprehensive study of the virus with a strong emphasis on the issue of 
structure. In his lab, RNA sequencing, now a little-known technique, evolved 
gradually from a means to solve the genetic code, to a tool for completing the 
first genome sequence. Thus, I follow the research pathway of Fiers and his 'RNA 
phage lab' with their evolving experimental system from 1960 to the late 1970s. 
This study illuminates two decisive shifts in post-war biology: the emergence of 
molecular biology as a discipline in the 1960s in Europe and of genomics in the 
1990s.

The isolation of pure nucleic acids from clinical samples is a crucial step in 
the molecular diagnosis of viral infections by nucleic acid testing (NAT). In 
this study, novel flat glass devices (cards) were demonstrated to support the 
rapid and efficient extraction of nucleic acids from upper respiratory tract 
specimens (nasal washes and swabs). The performance of the nucleic acid 
extraction cards was directly compared to an existing standardized and automated 
platform for viral extraction from these types of specimens. The flowthrough 
card method improved the speed of nucleic acid purification and accommodated 
larger sample volumes in extraction of bacteriophage MS2 RNA from the various 
specimen matrices. The dynamic range and estimated sensitivity of the card 
extraction method for reverse transcriptase quantitative real-time PCR 
(RT-qPCR)-based detection approximate those of the standardized magnetic glass 
bead extraction method used in this study.

nanoparticles by silica addition.

Silica doped TiO2(P25) nanoparticles are tested for its photocatalytic activity 
in the degradation of bacteriophage MS2. During our studies it was found that 
treatment of TiO2(P25) in the glass flasks sealed with silicone grease resulted 
in a significant improvement in the catalytic activity of the titania. Further 
improvement can be made by the purposeful reaction of TiO2(P25) with 2.5 wt % 
silica. This non in situ method of incorporating silica to TiO2(P25) 
nanoparticles is tested for their role in killing of viruses, and it is found 
that the rate constant is three times higher to kill viruses with the addition 
of silica. BET measurements show no significant change/increase in the surface 
area of silica doped TiO2(P25)-SiO2, compared to the undoped TiO2(P25). Further 
studies show that the addition of silica increases the adsorption of viruses 
onto the catalyst. There is a significant difference in the activity of the 
TiO2(P25)-SiO2 samples in the presence of methanol, supporting the notion that 
hydroxide radical (HO·) is responsible for the antiviral action. The 
TiO2(P25)-SiO2 either produces more HO· than non silica-doped material, or the 
enhanced adsorption of MS2 to the catalyst results in greater exposure to the 
HO·, or both mechanisms may work in concert. XPS studies suggest the formation 
of silica species on the surface of the TiO2(P25), while UV-visible spectroscopy 
suggests that the presence of the silica results in a small increase in the 
measured band gap. We suggest that the enhanced catalytic activity is a result 
of increased adsorption and/or band bending which can occur at the interface 
within TiO2(P25)-SiO2. One result of this would be a reduction of the 
electron-hole recombination, the formation of a greater concentration of OH·, 
and hence an improved catalytic performance.

surrogates for human norovirus (NoV) and coliphage (F+) MS2 by ultraviolet light 
(254 nm) and the effect of cell association on UV inactivation.

Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA. fyt8@cdc.gov

AIMS:  To determine inactivation profiles of three human norovirus (NoV) 
surrogate viruses and coliphage MS2 by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and the 
protective effect of cell association on UV inactivation.
METHODS AND RESULTS:   The inactivation rate for cell-free virus or 
intracellular echovirus 12 was determined by exposure to 254-nm UV light at 
fluence up to 100 mJ cm(-2) . The infectivity of murine norovirus (MNV), feline 
calicivirus (FCV) and echovirus 12 was determined by cell culture infectivity in 
susceptible host cell lines, and MS2 infectivity was plaque assayed on 
Escherichia coli host cells. The UV fluencies to achieve 4-log(10) inactivation 
were 25, 29, 30 and 70 (mJ cm(-2) ) for cell-free FCV, MNV, echovirus 12 and 
MS2, respectively. However, a UV fluence of 85 mJ cm(-2) was needed to 
inactivate intracellular echovirus 12 by 4 log(10) .
CONCLUSIONS: Murine norovirus and echoviruses 12 are more conservative 
surrogates than FCV to predict the UV inactivation response of human NoV. 
Intracellular echovirus 12 was 2·8-fold more resistant to UV irradiation than 
cell-free one.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Variation in UV susceptibilities among NoV 
surrogate viruses and a likely protective effect of cell association on virus 
susceptibility to UV irradiation should be considered for effective control of 
human NoV in water.

Inactivation and surface interactions of MS-2 bacteriophage in a TiO2 
photoelectrocatalytic reactor.

Technology, 200 Bobby Dodd Way, Atlanta, GA 30332-0373, USA.

Inactivation of MS-2 bacteriophage in a TiO(2) photoelectrocatalytic system was 
evaluated, wherein TiO(2) particles were coated onto an indium tin oxide (ITO) 
electrode and an electrical potential was applied under black light blue (BLB) 
irradiation. MS-2 phage inactivation was greatly enhanced by anodic potential, 
whereas cathodic potential completely inhibited inactivation. Experiments 
performed with radical scavengers showed that inactivation was primarily caused 
by hydroxyl radicals, both in the bulk phase and on the TiO(2) surface. 
Application of positive potential to the electrode was found to result in two 
distinct beneficial effects: (i) electrostatic attraction between the negatively 
charged viral capsid and catalyst surface, causing improved usage of 
surface-bound hydroxyl radical, in comparison to conventional TiO(2) 
photocatalytic disinfection; and (ii) higher reactive oxygen species production. 
Results also suggest that inactivation of various microorganisms including 
Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus 
subtilis spores and Cryptosporidium parvum oocyst was enhanced via positive 
potential induction to TiO(2).

system.

A research study has been performed to determine the ultraviolet (UV) 
fluence-response of several target non-pathogenic microorganisms to UV light 
emitting diodes (UV-LEDs) by performing collimated beam tests. UV-LEDs do not 
contain toxic mercury, offer design flexibility due to their small size, and 
have a longer operational life than mercury lamps. Comsol Multiphysics was 
utilized to create an optimal UV-LED collimated beam design based on number and 
spacing of UV-LEDs and distance of the sample from the light source while 
minimizing the overall cost. The optimized UV-LED collimated beam apparatus and 
a low-pressure mercury lamp collimated beam apparatus were used to determine the 
UV fluence-response of three surrogate microorganisms (Escherichia coli, MS-2, 
T7) to 255 nm UV-LEDs, 275 nm UV-LEDs, and 254 nm low-pressure mercury lamps. 
Irradiation by low-pressure mercury lamps produced greater E. coli and MS-2 
inactivation than 255 nm and 275 nm UV-LEDs and similar T7 inactivation to 
irradiation by 275 nm UV-LEDs. The 275 nm UV-LEDs produced more efficient T7 and 
E. coli inactivation than 255 nm UV-LEDs while both 255 nm and 275 nm UV-LEDs 
produced comparable microbial inactivation for MS-2. Differences may have been 
caused by a departure from the time-dose reciprocity law due to microbial repair 
mechanisms.

The determination of the virus retention capabilities of UF units during 
operation is essential for the operators of drinking water treatment facilities 
in order to guarantee an efficient and stable removal of viruses through time. 
In previous studies, an effective method (MS2-phage challenge tests) was 
developed by the Water Research Center of Veolia Environnement for the 
measurement of the virus retention rates (Log Removal Rate, LRV) of commercially 
available hollow fiber membranes at lab scale. In the present work, the protocol 
for monitoring membrane performance was transferred from lab scale to pilot 
scale. Membrane performances were evaluated during pilot trial and compared to 
the results obtained at lab scale with fibers taken from the pilot plant 
modules. PFU culture method was compared to RT-PCR method for the calculation of 
LRV in both cases. Preliminary tests at lab scale showed that both methods can 
be used interchangeably. For tests conducted on virgin membrane, a good 
consistency was observed between lab and pilot scale results with the two 
analytical methods used. This work intends to show that a reliable determination 
of the membranes performances based on RT-PCR analytical method can be achieved 
during the operation of the UF units.

In an effort to validate the use of ozone for contaminant oxidation and 
disinfection in water reclamation, extensive pilot testing was performed with 
ozone/H(2)O(2) and biological activated carbon (BAC) at the Reno-Stead Water 
Reclamation Facility in Reno, Nevada. Three sets of samples were collected over 
a five-month period of continuous operation, and these samples were analyzed for 
a suite of trace organic contaminants (TOrCs), total estrogenicity, and several 
microbial surrogates, including the bacteriophage MS2, total and fecal 
coliforms, and Bacillus spores. Based on the high degree of microbial 
inactivation and contaminant destruction, this treatment train appears to be a 
viable alternative to the standard indirect potable reuse (IPR) configuration 
(i.e., membrane filtration, reverse osmosis, UV/H(2)O(2), and aquifer 
injection), particularly for inland applications where brine disposal is an 
issue. Several issues, including regrowth of coliform bacteria in the BAC 
process, must be addressed prior to full-scale implementation.

Framework for using quantitative PCR as a nonculture based method to estimate 
virus infectivity.

Measuring the efficiency of virus disinfection with quantitative PCR (qPCR) has 
been criticized as inadequate due to the production of false-positive signals. 
Such a claim, however, presupposes an understanding of the theoretical qPCR 
response. Many studies have assumed that the loss in qPCR signal upon 
disinfection should equal the loss in infectivity, without accounting for the 
fact that qPCR typically assays only a fraction of the viral genome. This study 
aimed to develop a theoretical framework to relate viral infectivity with genome 
damage measured by qPCR. The framework quantified damage to the entire genome 
based on the qPCR amplification of smaller sections, assuming single-hit 
inactivation and a Poissonian distribution of damage. The framework was tested 
and modified using UV(254) inactivation studies with bacteriophage MS2 
(culturing and qPCR of approximately half the genome). Genome regions showed 
heterogeneous sensitivities to UV(254) treatment, thus deviating from the 
assumption of Poissonian damage. We offered two modifications to account for 
these deviations and confirmed that the qPCR-based framework accurately 
estimated virus infectivity. This framework offers the potential to monitor the 
infectivity of viruses that remain nonculturable (norovirus). While developed 
for UV(254)-inactivated virus, the framework should apply to any disinfection 
technique that causes inactivation via single genomic lesions.

The complete genome sequence of caulobacter phage phiCb5 has been determined, 
and four open reading frames (ORFs) have been identified and characterized. As 
for related phages, the ORFs code for maturation, coat, replicase, and lysis 
proteins, but unlike other Leviviridae members, the lysis protein gene of phiCb5 
entirely overlaps with the replicase in a different reading frame. The lysis 
protein of phiCb5 is about two times longer than that of the distantly related 
MS2 phage and presumably contains two transmembrane helices. Analysis of the 
proposed genome secondary structure revealed a stable 5' stem-loop, similar to 
other phages, and a substantially shorter 3' untranslated region (UTR) structure 
with only three stem-loops.

Real-time PCR techniques are now commonly used for the detection of viral 
genomes in various human specimens and require for validation both external and 
internal controls (ECs and ICs). In particular, ICs added to clinical samples 
are necessary to monitor the extraction, reverse transcription, and 
amplification steps in order to detect false-negative results resulting from 
PCR-inhibition or errors in the technical procedure. Here, we performed a large 
scale evaluation of the use of bacteriophages as ICs in routine molecular 
diagnosis. This allowed to propose simple standardized procedures (i) to design 
specific ECs for both DNA and RNA viruses and (ii) to use T4 (DNA) or MS2 (RNA) 
phages as ICs in routine diagnosis. Various technical formats for using phages 
as ICs were optimised and validated. Subsequently, T4 and MS2 ICs were evaluated 
in routine real-time PCR or RT-PCR virological diagnostic tests, using a series 
of 8,950 clinical samples (representing 36 distinct specimen types) sent to our 
laboratory for the detection of a variety of DNA and RNA viruses. The frequency 
of inefficient detection of ICs was analyzed according to the nature of the 
sample. Inhibitors of enzymatic reactions were detected at high frequency in 
specific sample types such as heparinized blood and bone marrow (>70%), 
broncho-alveolar liquid (41%) and stools (36%). The use of T4 and MS2 phages as 
ICs proved to be cost-effective, flexible and adaptable to various technical 
procedures of real-time PCR detection in virology. It represents a valuable 
strategy for enhancing the quality of routine molecular diagnosis in 
laboratories that use in-house designed diagnostic systems, which can 
conveniently be associated to the use of specific synthetic ECs. The high rate 
of inhibitors observed in a variety of specimen types should stimulate the 
elaboration of improved technical protocols for the extraction and amplification 
of nucleic acids.

Single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses, which include major human pathogens, 
package their genomes as they assemble their capsids. We show here that the 
organization of the viral genomes within the capsids provides intriguing 
insights into the highly cooperative nature of the assembly process. A recent 
cryo-electron microscopy structure of bacteriophage MS2, determined with only 
5-fold symmetry averaging, has revealed the asymmetric distribution of its 
encapsidated genome. Here we show that this RNA distribution is consistent with 
an assembly mechanism that follows two simple rules derived from experiment: (1) 
the binding of the MS2 maturation protein to the RNA constrains its conformation 
into a loop, and (2) the capsid must be built in an energetically favorable way. 
These results provide a new level of insight into the factors that drive 
efficient assembly of ssRNA viruses in vivo.

A new RNA vaccine platform based on MS2 virus-like particles produced in 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

mRNA vaccines are potentially attractive alternatives to DNA vaccines more often 
discussed, as they are generally considered safer than their DNA counterparts. 
The major limitations on the potency of RNA vaccines are their instability and 
inability to spread in vivo. Virus-like particles (VLPs) based on the 
bacteriophage MS2 have demonstrated remarkably high stability and may provide an 
improved platform for RNA-based genetic vaccination. However, no in vivo study 
of an MS2 VLP-mediated RNA vaccine has been reported. Therefore, we developed a 
model vaccine wherein MS2 VLPs packaging HIV-1 gag mRNAs (1544 bases) were 
produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and then, used to immunize BALB/c mice. 
Serological analyses showed that antigen-specific antibody responses were 
elicited by immunization. These findings suggest that MS2 VLPs can be used in 
the design and construction of novel and safe phage-based mRNA delivery vectors.

Visualising a viral RNA genome poised for release from its receptor complex.

LS2 9JT, UK.

We describe the cryo-electron microscopy structure of bacteriophage MS2 bound to 
its receptor, the bacterial F-pilus. The virus contacts the pilus at a capsid 
5-fold vertex, thus locating the surface-accessible portion of the single copy 
of the pilin-binding maturation protein present in virions. This arrangement 
allows a 5-fold averaged map to be calculated, showing for the first time in any 
virus-receptor complex the nonuniform distribution of RNA within the capsid. 
Strikingly, at the vertex that contacts the pilus, a rod of density that may 
include contributions from both genome and maturation protein sits above a 
channel that goes through the capsid to the outside. This density is reminiscent 
of the DNA density observed in the exit channel of double-stranded DNA phages, 
suggesting that the RNA-maturation protein complex is poised to leave the capsid 
as the first step of the infection process.

Nanotechnology has potential to offer solutions to problems facing the 
developing world. Here, we demonstrate the efficacy of an anodic multiwalled 
carbon nanotube (MWNT) microfilter toward the removal and inactivation of 
viruses (MS2) and bacteria (E. coli). In the absence of electrolysis, the MWNT 
filter is effective for complete removal of bacteria by sieving and multilog 
removal of viruses by depth-filtration. Concomitant electrolysis during 
filtration results in significantly increased inactivation of influent bacteria 
and viruses. At applied potentials of 2 and 3 V, the electrochemical MWNT filter 
reduced the number of bacteria and viruses in the effluent to below the limit of 
detection. Application of 2 and 3 V for 30 s postfiltration inactivated >75% of 
the sieved bacteria and >99.6% of the adsorbed viruses. Electrolyte 
concentration and composition had no correlation to electrochemical inactivation 
consistent with a direct oxidation mechanism at the MWNT filter surface. 
Potential dependent dye oxidation and E. coli morphological changes also support 
a direct oxidation mechanism. Advantages of the electrochemical MWNT filter for 
pathogen removal and inactivation and potential for point-of-use drinking water 
treatment are discussed.

E2509 Lafferre Hall, Columbia, MO 65211, USA.

Microbial contaminants such as bacteria and viruses are of great concern in 
water. As nanotechnology continues to grow, understanding the interactions of 
nanoparticles with bacteria and viruses is important to protect public health 
and the environment. In this study, the effect of two commonly used 
nanoparticles, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs, average particle size=21 nm) and 
zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs, average particle size=39 nm), on the growth 
of bacteria (Eschericia coli) and bacteriophages (MS2) were evaluated using a 
standard double agar layer (DAL) method and a turbidimetric microtiter assay. A 
1-h prior exposure of MS2 to nanoparticles did not inactivate MS2 at the highest 
nanoparticle concentrations tested (5mg/L total Ag and 20 mg/L ZnO). No 
bacteriophage inactivation was observed in the presence of AgNPs, Ag(+)/AgNPs 
(50:50 in mass ratio) or Ag(+) ions, all at the total Ag concentration of 5mg/L. 
In a binary (bacteria-phages) system where the E. coli host was exposed to MS2 
and nanoparticles simultaneously, the dynamic changes of active bacteria and MS2 
phages during incubation demonstrated that exposure of AgNPs (5mg/L Ag) and ZnO 
NPs (20mg/L ZnO) increased the number of phages by 2-6 orders of magnitude. 
These results suggested that exposure of nanoparticles could greatly facilitate 
bacterial viruses like MS2 to infect the E. coli host.

OBJECTIVE: The First Water Responder B package water treatment device was 
evaluated for its ability to reduce the levels of spiked indicators and 
pathogens (Escherichia coli, MS2 coliphage, murine adenovirus, and 
Cryptosporidium oocysts) in a surface water to partially evaluate its 
appropriateness to be used to provide safe drinking water to hospitals during 
emergency situations.
METHODS: Lake water was collected in 50-L carboys and spiked with selected 
indicators and pathogens (E coli, MS2 coliphage, murine adenovirus, and 
Cryptosporidium oocysts) at 2 different spike levels (low and high). This water 
was treated using the First Water Responder B, and the microorganisms were 
enumerated before and after treatment using US Environmental Protection Agency 
and Standard Methods. Microbial removal efficiencies were compared with 
Environmental Protection Agency guidelines.
RESULTS: E coli spikes ranged from 2.9 to 1059 colony-forming units (CFU)/100 mL 
with removals to below detection limits (1 CFU/100 mL) to 2.8 CFU/100 mL or 0.98 
to 3.5 log(10) reductions. MS2 coliphage spikes ranged from 3 plaque-forming 
units (PFU) to 837 PFU/100 mL with removals to below detection limits (1 PFU/100 
mL) to 11.7 PFU/100 mL or 0.65 to 1.9 log(10) reductions. Murine adenovirus 
spikes ranged from 203 to 8410 most probable number (MPN) of infectious 
units/100 mL with removals to below detection limits (23 MPN infectious 
units/100 mL) to 1370 MPN infectious units/100 mL or 0.79 to >1.2 log(10) 
reductions. Cryptosporidium parvum oocyst spikes ranged from 52 to 853 oocysts 
per liter with removals to below detection limits (<1 oocyst per liter) to 0.3 
oocysts per liter or >2.2 to 3.4 log(10) reductions.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the First Water system could remove a significant portion 
of the spiked organisms, it is recommended that this point-of-use system be 
coupled with chemical disinfection in a multiple-barrier approach to provide 
water of the highest reasonably achievable quality for hospital use in emergency 
situations.

The rapid assembly of icosohedral virus-like particles (VLPs) into highly 
ordered (domain size > 600 nm), oriented 2D superlattices directly onto a solid 
substrate using convective coating is demonstrated. In-situ grazing-incidence 
small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) is used to follow the self-assembly 
process in real time to characterize the mechanism of superlattice formation, 
with the ultimate goal of tailoring film deposition conditions to optimize 
long-range order. From water, GISAXS data are consistent with a 
transport-limited assembly process where convective flow directs assembly of 
VLPs into a lattice oriented with respect to the water drying line. Addition of 
a nonvolatile solvent (glycerol) modified this assembly pathway, resulting in 
non-oriented superlattices with improved long-range order. Modification of 
electrostatic conditions (solution ionic strength, substrate charge) also alters 
assembly behavior; however, a comparison of in-situ assembly data between VLPs 
derived from the bacteriophages MS2 and Qβ show that this assembly process is 
not fully described by a simple Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek model alone.

Penetration of viruses through soils is governed by the processes of transport, 
reversible adsorption, accumulation and inactivation. Until now, it was 
difficult to decouple the latter two processes and accurately predict viral 
fate. The present work describes a novel method-tracer studies with a mixture of 
native and fluorescent-dyed bacteriophages-that facilitates parallel 
quantification of the two processes. When the native phages are experiencing 
both accumulation and inactivation, the labeled ones are inactivated already and 
therefore can only be accumulated. Thus the effect of inactivation is applicable 
to native bacteriophages only and depletion of phage concentration due to 
inactivation can be elucidated from a total phage balance. The novel approach is 
exemplified by batch and column studies of the effects of temperature, pH, and 
saturation, on inactivation of MS2 bacteriophage. A three-parameter model 
accounting for inactivation, reversible adsorption (i.e., retardation), and 
accumulation is implemented.

Asymmetric mRNA localisation to specific compartments of the cell is a 
fundamental mechanism of -spatial and temporal regulation of gene expression. It 
is used by a variety of organisms and cell types to achieve different cellular 
functions. However, the mechanisms of mRNA localisation are not well understood. 
An important advance in this field has been the development of techniques that 
allow the visualisation of mRNA movements in living cells in real time. In this 
paper, we describe one approach to visualising mRNA localisation in vivo, in 
which RNAs containing MS2 binding sites are labelled by the MS2 coat protein 
fused to fluorescent reporters. We discuss the use of this mRNA-MS2/MS2CP-FP 
system to study mRNA localisation during Drosophila oogenesis, and provide a 
detailed explanation of the steps required for this approach, including the 
design of the mRNA-MS2 and MS2CP-FP constructs, the preparation of fly oocytes 
for imaging, the optimal microscope configurations for live cell imaging, and 
strategies for image processing and analysis.

In this study, a new biosynthetic tracer was developed to characterize the virus 
retention dynamics of membrane systems. This new tracer is a modified 
bacteriophage obtained by the grafting of enzymatic probes to an MS2 
bacteriophage, one of the smallest non-pathogenic bacteria viruses, with an 
average diameter of about 30 nm. A protocol for the synthesis and purification 
of this new tracer was developed in this work. The production of this 
biosynthetic tracer was first qualitatively shown by a chromatographic 
characterization and an enzymatic test. The average number of probes grafted per 
phage was then quantified for three batches of tracers made from the same native 
phage suspension and the same batch of enzymatic probes. This quantification 
demonstrated the reproducibility of the synthesis protocol developed.

In a previous work, a reproducible procedure to produce a new biosynthetic 
tracer was developed. This new tracer is an MS2 bacteriophage with enzymatic 
probes grafted on its surface, which can induce enzymatic activity of the 
tracer. In this paper, the biochemical and physicochemical characteristics of 
this new tracer are determined. A protocol was developed to determine the 
specific enzymatic activity kcat(TRACER) of the tracer, which was found to be 
2.93±0.78×10(4) min(-1) on average. Physicochemical characterizations of this 
new tracer showed that it is representative of viruses and may thus be used as a 
virus surrogate to assess the virus retention of membrane systems inline. 
Notably, the mean diameter and molecular weight of the tracer were found to be 
respectively 64.1±0.3 nm and 12,140±3654 kDa, which are within the size and 
molecular weight ranges of pathogenic viruses carried by water. The tracer 
surface was also studied and revealed the considerable porosity of the grafted 
probe layer, with a mean porosity of 88%, which could explain why the zeta 
potential of the tracers (-14.34±1.66 mV) was nearly the same as that of the 
native MS2 phages. Finally, a comparison between filtration of the reference 
microorganism used for membrane performance assessment (the MS2 phage) and the 
tracer suspensions showed the same filtration behaviour.

Simultaneous comparison of murine norovirus, feline calicivirus, coliphage MS2,

human norovirus on a fecally soiled stainless steel surface.

Free chlorine as hypochlorite is recommended to decontaminate fecally 
contaminated surfaces to control human norovirus (NoV). We evaluated the 
efficacy of sodium hypochlorite to decontaminate GII.4 NoV and three surrogates 
of human NoVs, feline calicivirus (FCV), murine norovirus (MNV), and coliphage 
MS2, on a fecally soiled stainless steel surface. Reduction of infectivity of 
FCV, MNV, and MS2 was measured by plaque assay and the decline of genomic copy 
numbers of GII.4 NoV by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Sodium 
hypochlorite solution at 5000 ppm could inactivate FCV by 3 log(10) plaque 
forming units after approximately 1.9 minutes of contact time, but required 
longer exposure times of 3.2 and 4.5 minutes to reduce MNV and MS2 by 3 log(10), 
respectively. However, detection of viral RNA by reverse 
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay may not be reliable to estimate 
the effectiveness of sodium hypochlorite against human NoV. Of three NoV 
surrogates, FCV is not the most resistant of the virus tested for inactivation 
by hypochlorite and thus is not the worst-case model for estimating NoV 
inactivation. Although the use of 5000 ppm of hypochlorite for fecally soiled 
surfaces is effective, it may require longer exposure times of ≥3 minutes to 
control NoVs. Surface precleaning before hypochlorite disinfection is 
recommended to initially reduce the fecal organic load for better virus 
inactivation and should be a part of the environmental hygiene response measures 
during an NoV outbreak or where NoV fecal contamination of environmental 
surfaces is likely or suspected to be present.

virus-like particles.

Filamentous phages are now the most widely used vehicles for phage display and 
provide efficient means for epitope identification. However, the peptides they 
display are not very immunogenic because they normally fail to present foreign 
epitopes at the very high densities required for efficient B-cell activation. 
Meanwhile, systems based on virus-like particles (VLPs) permit the engineered 
high-density display of specific epitopes but are incapable of peptide library 
display and affinity selection. We developed a new peptide display platform 
based on VLPs of the RNA bacteriophage MS2. It combines the high immunogenicity 
of MS2 VLPs with the affinity selection capabilities of other phage display 
systems. Here, we describe plasmid vectors that facilitate the construction of 
high-complexity random sequence peptide libraries on MS2 VLPs and that allow 
control of the stringency of affinity selection through the manipulation of 
display valency. We used the system to identify epitopes for several previously 
characterized monoclonal antibody targets and showed that the VLPs thus obtained 
elicit antibodies in mice whose activities mimic those of the selecting 
antibodies.

Thermal stability of RNA phage virus-like particles displaying foreign peptides.

Caldeira JC(1), Peabody DS.

Author information:

School of Medicine, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87131, USA.

BACKGROUND: To be useful for genetic display of foreign peptides a viral coat 
protein must tolerate peptide insertions without major disruption of subunit 
folding and capsid assembly. The folding of the coat protein of RNA phage MS2 
does not normally tolerate insertions in its AB-loop, but an engineered 
single-chain dimer readily accepts them as long as they are restricted to one of 
its two halves.
RESULTS: Here we characterize the effects of peptide insertions on the thermal 
stabilities of MS2 virus-like particles (VLPs) displaying a variety of different 
peptides in one AB-loop of the coat protein single-chain dimer. These particles 
typically denature at temperatures around 5-10°C lower than unmodified VLPs. 
Even so, they are generally stable up to about 50°C. VLPs of the related RNA 
phage PP7 are cross-linked with intersubunit disulfide bonds and are therefore 
significantly more stable. An AB-loop insertion also reduces the stability of 
PP7 VLPs, but they only begin to denature above about 70°C.
CONCLUSIONS: VLPs assembled from MS2 single-chain dimer coat proteins with 
peptide insertions in one of their AB-loops are somewhat less stable than the 
wild-type particle, but still resist heating up to about 50°C. Because they 
possess disulfide cross-links, PP7-derived VLPs provide an alternate platform 
with even higher stability.

Virus-like particles (VLPs) of bacteriophage MS2 possess numerous features that 
make them well-suited for use in targeted delivery of therapeutic and imaging 
agents. MS2 VLPs can be rapidly produced in large quantities using in vivo or in 
vitro synthesis techniques. Their capsids can be modified in precise locations 
via genetic insertion or chemical conjugation, facilitating the multivalent 
display of targeting ligands. MS2 VLPs also self-assemble in the presence of 
nucleic acids to specifically encapsidate siRNA and RNA-modified cargos. Here we 
report the use of MS2 VLPs to selectively deliver nanoparticles, 
chemotherapeutic drugs, siRNA cocktails, and protein toxins to human 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MS2 VLPs modified with a peptide (SP94) that 
binds HCC exhibit a 10(4)-fold higher avidity for HCC than for hepatocytes, 
endothelial cells, monocytes, or lymphocytes and can deliver high concentrations 
of encapsidated cargo to the cytosol of HCC cells. SP94-targeted VLPs loaded 
with doxorubicin, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil selectively kill the HCC cell 
line, Hep3B, at drug concentrations <1 nM, while SP94-targeted VLPs that 
encapsidate a siRNA cocktail, which silences expression of cyclin family 
members, induce growth arrest and apoptosis of Hep3B at siRNA concentrations 
<150 pM. Impressively, MS2 VLPs, when loaded with ricin toxin A-chain (RTA) and 
modified to codisplay the SP94 targeting peptide and a histidine-rich fusogenic 
peptide (H5WYG) that promotes endosomal escape, kill virtually the entire 
population of Hep3B cells at an RTA concentration of 100 fM without affecting 
the viability of control cells. Our results demonstrate that MS2 VLPs, because 
of their tolerance of multivalent peptide display and their ability to 
specifically encapsidate a variety of chemically disparate cargos, induce 
selective cytotoxicity of cancer in vitro and represent a significant 
improvement in the characteristics of VLP-based delivery systems.

Impact of internal RNA on aggregation and electrokinetics of viruses: comparison 
between MS2 phage and corresponding virus-like particles.

We compare for the first time the electrokinetic and aggregation properties of 
MS2 phage (pH 2.5 to 7, 1 to 100 mM NaNO(3) electrolyte concentration) with 
those of the corresponding virus-like particles (VLPs), which lack entirely the 
inner viral RNA component. In line with our previous work (J. Langlet, F. 
Gaboriaud, C. Gantzer, and J. F. L. Duval, Biophys. J. 94:3293-3312, 2008), it 
is found that modifying the content of RNA within the virus leads to very 
distinct electrohydrodynamic and aggregation profiles for MS2 and MS2 VLPs. 
Under the given pH and concentration conditions, MS2 VLPs exhibit 
electrophoretic mobility larger in magnitude than that of MS2, and both have 
similar isoelectric point (IEP) values (∼4). The electrokinetic results reflect 
a greater permeability of MS2 VLPs to electroosmotic flow, developed 
within/around these soft particles during their migration under the action of 
the applied electrical field. Results also support the presence of some 
remaining negatively charged component within the VLPs. In addition, MS2 phage 
systematically forms aggregates at pH values below the IEP, regardless of the 
magnitude of the solution ionic strength, whereas MS2 VLPs aggregate under the 
strict condition where the pH is relatively equal to the IEP at sufficiently low 
salt concentrations (<10 mM). It is argued that the stability of VLPs against 
aggregation and the differences between electrokinetics of MS2 and corresponding 
VLPs conform to recently developed formalisms for the stability and 
electrohydrodynamics of soft multilayered particles. The differences between the 
surface properties of these two kinds of particles reported here suggest that 
VLPs may not be appropriate for predicting the behavior of pathogenic viruses in 
aqueous media.

A multifunctional reagent based on a coumarin scaffold was developed for 
derivatization of naive RNA. The alkylating agent N3BC 
[7-azido-4-(bromomethyl)coumarin], obtained by Pechmann condensation, is 
selective for uridine. N3BC and its RNA conjugates are pre-fluorophores which 
permits controlled modular and stepwise RNA derivatization. The success of RNA 
alkylation by N3BC can be monitored by photolysis of the azido moiety, which 
generates a coumarin fluorophore that can be excited with UV light of 320 nm. 
The azidocoumarin-modified RNA can be flexibly employed in structure-function 
studies. Versatile applications include direct use in photo-crosslinking studies 
to cognate proteins, as demonstrated with tRNA and RNA fragments from the MS2 
phage and the HIV genome. Alternatively, the azide function can be used for 
further derivatization by click-chemistry. This allows e.g. the introduction of 
an additional fluorophore for excitation with visible light.

Tangential flow hollow-fiber ultrafiltration (HFUF) was evaluated for virus and 
Cryptosporidium parvum concentration from water. Recovery of viruses at a low 
filtration rate was found to be significantly greater than at a higher 
filtration rate, with the recoveries of bacteriophage MS2 at high and low 
filtration rates shown to be 64.7% and 98.7%, respectively. Poliovirus 
recoveries from tap water were similar to MS2, with recoveries of 62.9% and 
104.5% for high and low filtration rates, respectively. C. parvum, which was 
only tested at high filtration rates, had an average recovery was 105.1%. In 
addition to the optimization of the primary concentration technique, this study 
also compared several secondary concentration procedures. The highest recovery 
(89.5%) of poliovirus from tap water concentrates was obtained when a beef 
extract-celite method was used and the virus was eluted from the celite with 
phosphate buffered saline, pH 9.0. When HFUF primary concentration and the 
optimal secondary concentration methods were combined, an average recovery of 
97.0 ± 35.6% or 89.3 ± 19.3%, depending on spike level, was achieved for 
poliovirus. This study demonstrated that HFUF primary concentration method is 
effective at recovering MS2, poliovirus and C. parvum from large volumes of 
water and that beef extract-celite method is an effective secondary 
concentration method for the poliovirus tested.

Virus attenuation by microbial mechanisms during the idle time of a household 
slow sand filter.

The biosand filter (BSF) is a household slow sand filter that is operated 
intermittently such that an idle time of typically 18-22 h occurs in between 
daily charges of water. Virus attenuation during the idle time was investigated 
over repeated daily filtration cycles to capture the effect of media aging that 
encompasses processes occurring throughout the filter depth rather than 
restricted to the schmutzdecke at the media surface. A threshold aging period of 
about one to two weeks was required before virus attenuation began. The observed 
rates of MS2 and PRD-1 reduction were first-order and reached maxima of 0.061- 
and 0.053-log per hr, respectively, over seven-to-ten weeks. Suppression of 
microbial activity by sodium azide eliminated virus reduction during the idle 
time thus indicating that the operative media aging process was microbially 
mediated. The mechanism of virus reduction was not modification of media 
surfaces by physical/chemical or microbial processes. Instead, it appears that 
the activity of the microbial community within the filter is responsible. The 
most likely biological pathways are production of microbial exoproducts such as 
proteolytic enzymes or grazing of bacteria and higher microorganisms on virus 
particles. Implications of these findings for BSF design and operation and their 
relevance to other biological filtration technologies are discussed.

The antiviral activities of poly(phenylene ethynylene) (PPE)-based cationic 
conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPE) and oligo-phenylene ethynylenes (OPE) were 
investigated using two model viruses, the T4 and MS2 bacteriophages. Under 
UV/visible light irradiation, significant antiviral activity was observed for 
all of the CPEs and OPEs; without irradiation, most of these compounds exhibited 
high inactivation activity against the MS2 phage and moderate inactivation 
ability against the T4 phage. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and SDS 
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) reveal that the CPEs and OPEs 
exert their antiviral activity by partial disassembly of the phage particle 
structure in the dark and photochemical damage of the phage capsid protein under 
UV/visible light irradiation.

Materials for the Purification of Water with Systems, University of Illinois at 
Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL 61801, United States.

Laboratory studies were performed to determine if the addition of iron oxides 
throughout biosand filter (BSF) media would increase virus removal due to 
adsorption. The proposed mechanism is electrostatic adsorption of negatively 
charged virion particles to positively charged iron oxides formed during the 
corrosion of zerovalent iron. Initial tests conducted using continuous flow, 
small-scale glass columns showed high MS2 bacteriophage removal in an 
iron-amended sand column (5log10) compared to a sand-only column (0.5log10) over 
20 pore volumes. Additionally, two experiments with a column containing iron 
particles revealed 4log10 and 5log10 removal of rotavirus in the presence of 20 
mg/L total organic carbon. Full-scale BSFs with iron particles removed>4log10 
MS2 for the duration of the experiment (287 days), while BSF with steel wool 
removed>4log10 MS2 for the first 160 days. Plug flow for the BSF was shown to 
depend on uniformity between the iron oxide material and sand media grains. The 
results suggest that the duration of effective virus removal by iron-amended 
biosand filtration depends on source water conditions and the quantity and 
composition of iron material added. Overall, this study provides evidence that 
iron-amended BSFs may advance the field of point-of-use technologies and bring 
relief to millions of people suffering from waterborne diseases.

This study demonstrates the inactivation of MS2 coliphage (MS2) by nano 
particulate zerovalent iron (nZVI) and ferrous ion (Fe[II]) in aqueous solution. 
For nZVI, the inactivation efficiency of MS2 under air-saturated conditions was 
greater than that observed under deaerated conditions, indicating that reactions 
associated with the oxidation of nZVI were mainly responsible for the MS2 
inactivation. Under air-saturated conditions, the inactivation efficiency 
increased with decreasing pH for both nZVI and Fe(II), associated with the 
pH-dependent stability of Fe(II). Although the Fe(II) released from nZVI 
appeared to contribute significantly to the virucidal activity of nZVI, several 
findings suggest that the nZVI surfaces interacted directly with the MS2 phages, 
leading to their inactivation. First, the addition of 1,10-phenanthroline (a 
strong Fe(II)-chelating agent) failed to completely block the inactivation of 
MS2 by nZVI. Second, under deaerated conditions, a linear dose-log inactivation 
curve was still observed for nZVI. Finally, ELISA analysis indicated that nZVI 
caused more capsid damage than Fe(II).

We used the bacteriophages Qβ and MS2 to determine whether viruses are 
inactivated by aluminum coagulants during the coagulation process. We performed 
batch coagulation and filtration experiments with virus-containing solutions. 
After filtering the supernatant of the coagulated solution through a membrane 
with a pore size of 50 nm, we measured the virus concentration by both the 
plaque forming unit (PFU) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. The virus 
concentration determined by the PFU method, which determines the infectious 
virus concentration, was always lower than that determined by the PCR-based 
method, which determines total virus concentration, regardless of infectivity. 
This discrepancy can be explained by the formation of aggregates consisting of 
several virus particles or by the inactivation of viruses in the coagulation 
process. The former possibility can be discounted because (i) aggregates of 
several virus particles would not pass through the 50-nm pores of the filtration 
membrane, and (ii) our particle size measurements revealed that the virus 
particles in the membrane filtrate were monodispersed. These observations 
clearly showed that non-infectious Qβ particles were present in the membrane 
filtrate after the coagulation process with aluminum coagulants. We subsequently 
revealed that the viruses lost their infectivity after being mixed with 
hydrolyzing aluminum species during the coagulation process.

Tennessee-Knoxville, Knoxville, Tennessee 37996-4591, USA.

Pomegranate juice (PJ) and pomegranate polyphenolic extracts (PP) have antiviral 
effects against HIV-1, influenza, herpes, and poxviruses, and we recently 
demonstrated their effect against human noroviral surrogates. In the present 
study, the time-dependent effects of two commercial brands of PJ and PP at two 
concentrations (2 and 4 mg/mL) on the infectivity of foodborne viral surrogates 
(feline calicivirus FCV-F9, murine norovirus MNV-1, and MS2 bacteriophage) at 
room temperature for up to 1 h were evaluated. Each virus at ∼5 log(10) 
plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL was mixed with equal volumes of PJ, or PP at 4 or 
8 mg/mL, and incubated for 0, 10, 20, 30, 45, and 60 min at room temperature. 
Viral titers after each treatment were determined by standardized plaque assays 
and compared with untreated controls. Virus titer reduction by PJ and PP was 
found to be a rather rapid process, with ≥50% of titer reduction occurring 
within the first 20 min of treatment for all three tested viruses. Within the 
first 20 min, titer reductions of 3.12, 0.79, and 0.23 log(10) PFU/mL for 
FCV-F9, MNV-1, and MS2, respectively, were obtained using PJ. FCV-F9, MNV-1, and 
MS2 titers were reduced by 4.02, 0.68, and 0.18 log(10) PFU/mL with 2 mg/mL PP 
and 5.09, 1.14, and 0.19 log(10) PFU/mL with 4 mg/mL PP, respectively, after 
20 min. The mechanism of viral reduction by PJ and PP needs to be elucidated and 
clinical trials should be undertaken before recommending for therapeutic or 
preventive purposes.

Using synthetically modified proteins to make new materials.

Witus LS(1), Francis MB.

94720-1460, USA.

The uniquely diverse structures and functions of proteins offer many exciting 
opportunities for creating new materials with advanced properties. Exploiting 
these capabilities requires a set of versatile chemical reactions that can 
attach nonnatural groups to specific locations on protein surfaces. Over the 
years, we and others have developed a series of new techniques for protein 
bioconjugation, with a particular emphasis on achieving high site selectivity 
and yield. Using these reactions, we have been able to prepare a number of new 
materials with functions that depend on both the natural and the synthetic 
components. In this Account, we discuss our progress in protein bioconjugation 
over the past decade, focusing on three distinct projects. We first consider our 
work to harness sunlight artificially by mimicking features of the 
photosynthetic apparatus, with its beautifully integrated system of 
chromophores, electron transfer groups, and catalytic centers. Central to these 
photosystems are light-harvesting antennae having hundreds of precisely aligned 
chromophores with positions that are dictated by the proteins within the arrays. 
Our approach to generating similar arrangements involves the self-assembly of 
tobacco mosaic virus coat proteins bearing synthetic chromophore groups. These 
systems offer efficient light collection, are easy to prepare, and can be used 
to build complex photocatalytic systems through the modification of multiple 
sites on the protein surfaces. We then discuss protein-based carriers that can 
deliver drugs and imaging agents to diseased tissues. The nanoscale agents we 
have built for this purpose are based on the hollow protein shell of 
bacteriophage MS2. These 27 nm capsids have 32 pores, which allow the entry of 
relatively large organic molecules into the protein shell without requiring 
disassembly. Our group has developed a series of chemical strategies that can 
install dyes, radiolabels, MRI contrast agents, and anticancer drugs on the 
inside surface of these capsids. We have also developed methods to decorate the 
external surfaces with binders for specific proteins on cancer cells. As a third 
research area, our group has developed protein-polymer hybrid materials for 
water remediation. To reduce the toxicity of heavy metals in living cells, 
Nature has evolved metallothioneins, which are sulfur-rich polypeptides that 
bind mercury, cadmium, and other toxic ions at sub-parts-per-billion 
concentrations. Unfortunately, these proteins are very difficult to incorporate 
into polymers, largely because typical protein modification reactions target the 
very cysteine, lysine, and carboxylate-containing residues that are required for 
their proper function. To address this challenge, we developed a new way to 
attach these (and many other) proteins to polymer chains by expressing them as 
part of an N- and C-terminal modification "cassette". The resulting materials 
retain their selectivity and can remove trace amounts of toxic metal ions from 
ocean water. Each of these examples has presented a new set of protein 
bioconjugation challenges that have been met through the development of new 
reaction methodology. Future progress in the generation of protein-based 
materials will require scalable synthetic techniques with improved yields and 
selectivities, inexpensive purification methods for bioconjugates, and 
theoretical and dynamical treatments for designing new materials through protein 
self-assembly.

Viruses in wastewater and natural environments are often present as aggregates. 
The disinfectant dose required for their inactivation, however, is typically 
determined with dispersed viruses. This study investigates how aggregation 
affects virus inactivation by chemical disinfectants. Bacteriophage MS2 was 
aggregated by lowering the solution pH, and aggregates were inactivated by 
peracetic acid (PAA). Aggregates were redispersed before enumeration to obtain 
the residual number of individual infectious viruses. In contrast to enumerating 
whole aggregates, this approach allowed an assessment of disinfection efficiency 
which remains applicable even if the aggregates disperse in post-treatment 
environments. Inactivation kinetics were determined as a function of aggregate 
size (dispersed, 0.55 and 0.90 μm radius) and PAA concentration (5-103 mg/L). 
Aggregation reduced the apparent inactivation rate constants 2-6 fold. The 
larger the aggregate and the higher the PAA concentration, the more pronounced 
the inhibitory effect of aggregation on disinfection. A reaction-diffusion based 
model was developed to interpret the experimental results, and to predict 
inactivation rates for additional aggregate sizes and disinfectants. The model 
showed that the inhibitory effect of aggregation arises from consumption of the 
disinfectant within the aggregate, but that diffusion of the disinfectant into 
the aggregates is not a rate-limiting factor. Aggregation therefore has a large 
inhibitory effect if highly reactive disinfectants are used, whereas 
inactivation by mild disinfectants is less affected. Our results suggest that 
mild disinfectants should be used for the treatment of water containing viral 
aggregates.

Comparison of surface sampling methods for virus recovery from fomites.

Studies, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305-4020, USA.

The role of fomites in infectious disease transmission relative to other 
exposure routes is difficult to discern due, in part, to the lack of information 
on the level and distribution of virus contamination on surfaces. Comparisons of 
studies intending to fill this gap are difficult because multiple different 
sampling methods are employed and authors rarely report their method's lower 
limit of detection. In the present study, we compare a subset of sampling 
methods identified from a literature review to demonstrate that sampling method 
significantly influences study outcomes. We then compare a subset of methods 
identified from the review to determine the most efficient methods for 
recovering virus from surfaces in a laboratory trial using MS2 bacteriophage as 
a model virus. Recoveries of infective MS2 and MS2 RNA are determined using both 
a plaque assay and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, respectively. We 
conclude that the method that most effectively recovers virus from nonporous 
fomites uses polyester-tipped swabs prewetted in either one-quarter-strength 
Ringer's solution or saline solution. This method recovers a median fraction for 
infective MS2 of 0.40 and for MS2 RNA of 0.07. Use of the proposed method for 
virus recovery in future fomite sampling studies would provide opportunities to 
compare findings across multiple studies.

workers' skin and clothing during removal of personal protective equipment.

BACKGROUND: The removal of personal protective equipment (PPE) after patient 
care may result in transfer of virus to hands and clothing of health care 
workers (HCWs). The risk of transfer can be modeled using harmless viruses to 
obtain quantitative data. To determine whether double-gloving reduces virus 
transfer to HCWs' hands and clothing during removal of contaminated PPE, we 
conducted a human challenge study using bacteriophages to compare the frequency 
and quantity of virus transfer to hands and clothes during PPE removal with 
single-gloving and double-gloving technique.
METHODS: Each experiment had a double-gloving phase and a single-gloving phase. 
Participants donned PPE (ie, contact isolation gown, N95 respirator, eye 
protection, latex gloves). The gown, respirator, eye protection, and dominant 
glove were contaminated with bacteriophage. Participants then removed the PPE, 
and their hands, face, and scrubs were sampled for virus.
RESULTS: Transfer of virus to hands during PPE removal was significantly more 
frequent with single-gloving than with double-gloving. Transfer to scrubs was 
similar during single-gloving and double-gloving. The amount of virus transfer 
to hands ranged from 0.15 to 2.5 log(10) most probable number. Significantly 
more virus was transferred to participants' hands after single-gloving than 
after double-gloving.
CONCLUSIONS: Our comparison of double-gloving and single-gloving using a 
simulation system with MS2 and a most-probable number method suggests that 
double gloving can reduce the risk of viral contamination of HCWs' hands during 
PPE removal. If incorporated into practice when full PPE is worn, this practice 
may reduce the risk of viral contamination of HCWs' hands during PPE removal. 
The use of double gloves should be explored in larger controlled studies.

NA.

The authors have investigated the adsorption-elution of intestinal 
bacteriophages T2 and MS2 as a model of enteric viruses, by using the coagulants 
aluminum oxychloride (AOX78) and aluminum sulfate (AS). The investigation has 
ascertained the effective removal of the phages from water with AOX78 
(98.7-100%) and the low efficiency of elution of coliphages from the particles 
of AOX hydrolysis products (0.1-3.7% of the baseline count of bacteriophages), 
which may suggest that AOX has antiviral activity. The above phenomena produced 
by AS are less evident.

On the origin of order in the genome organization of ssRNA viruses.

Single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses form a major class that includes important 
human, animal, and plant pathogens. While the principles underlying the 
structures of their protein capsids are generally well understood, much less is 
known about the organization of their encapsulated genomic RNAs. Cryo-electron 
microscopy and x-ray crystallography have revealed striking evidence of order in 
the packaged genomes of a number of ssRNA viruses. The physical determinants of 
such order, however, are largely unknown. We study here the relative effect of 
different energetic contributions, as well as the role of confinement, on the 
genome packaging of a representative ssRNA virus, the bacteriophage MS2, via a 
series of biomolecular simulations in which different energy terms are 
systematically switched off. We show that the bimodal radial density profile of 
the packaged genome is a consequence of RNA self-repulsion in confinement, 
suggesting that it should be similar for all ssRNA viruses with a comparable 
ratio of capsid size/genome length. In contrast, the detailed structure of the 
outer shell of the RNA density depends crucially on steric contributions from 
the capsid inner surface topography, implying that the various different 
polyhedral RNA cages observed in experiment are largely due to differences in 
the inner surface topography of the capsid.

Simulated sunlight action spectra for inactivation of MS2 and PRD1 
bacteriophages in clear water.

Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720-1710, United States.

Action spectra for simulated sunlight were measured in clear water for two 
viruses: PRD1, a double-stranded DNA bacteriophage, and MS2, a single-stranded 
RNA bacteriophage. Viruses were diluted into phosphate buffered saline (20 mM 
PBS, pH 7.5) and exposed for 22 h to simulated sunlight either directly or 
through one of six glass filters with 50% cutoff wavelengths ranging from 280 to 
350 nm. Virus survival was measured using the double agar layer plaque method. 
Both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) light were found to contribute to 
PRD1 inactivation, while only UVB inactivated MS2. A computational model was 
developed for interpreting these action spectra with 3-nm resolution. Using 
these methods, we provide detailed estimates of the sensitivity of MS2 and PRD1 
to photoinactivation from 285 to 345 nm. The resulting sensitivity coefficients 
can be combined with solar spectra to estimate inactivation rates in clear water 
under different sunlight conditions. This approach will be useful for modeling 
the inactivation of viruses and other microorganisms in sunlit natural and 
engineered systems.

Based on their extremely high mutation rates, RNA viruses have been 
traditionally considered as the fastest evolving entities in nature. However, 
recent work has revealed that, despite their greater replication fidelity, 
single-stranded (ss) DNA viruses can evolve fast in a similar way. To further 
investigate this issue, we have compared the rates of adaptation and molecular 
evolution of ssRNA and ssDNA viruses under highly controlled laboratory 
conditions using the bacteriophages ΦX174, G4, f1, Qβ, SP, and MS2 as model 
systems. Our results indicate that ssRNA phages evolve faster than ssDNA phages 
under strong selective pressure, and that their extremely high mutation rates 
appear to be optimal for this kind of scenario. However, their performance 
becomes similar to that of ssDNA phages over the longer term or when the 
population is moderately well-adapted. Interestingly, the roughly 100-fold 
difference between the mutation rates of ssRNA and ssDNA phages yields less than 
a fivefold difference in adaptation and nucleotide substitution rates. The 
results are therefore consistent with the observation that, despite their lower 
mutation rates, ssDNA viruses can sometimes match the evolvability of RNA 
viruses.

Four icosahedral RNA viruses are considered: the cowpea chlorotic mottle virus, 
the satellite tobacco mosaic virus, the pariacoto virus and the MS2 
bacteriophage. The validity of the phenomenological rules derived in previous 
publications (crystallographic scaling, indexed forms enclosing axial-symmetric 
clusters, packing lattices of viral crystals) is confirmed and shown to apply 
equally well to the coat proteins as to the (ordered) RNA chains.

The RNA viruses cowpea chlorotic mottle, satellite tobacco mosaic, pariacoto and 
MS2, already considered in part IV of this series of papers [Janner, A. (2011a), 
Acta Cryst. A67, 517-520], are investigated further, with the aim to arrive at a 
possible physical basis for their structural properties. The shell structure of 
the filled capsid is analyzed in terms of successive spherical boundaries of the 
sets of icosahedral equivalent chains. By inversion in the sphere enclosing the 
capsid, the internal boundaries are transformed into external ones, which are 
more easily visualized. This graphical procedure reveals the presence of 
regularly spaced shells with boundaries fitting with anti-nodal surfaces of the 
virus considered as an elastic resonator. The centers of gravity of the various 
chains occur in the nodal regions of eigenvibrations with wavelength λ = 
R(0)/K(0), where R(0) is the radius of the virus and K(0) takes one of the 
values 12, 6, 4, 3, depending on the mode. The resonator model is consistent 
with practically all spherical shell boundaries, whereas deviations are observed 
for the icosahedral axial modes, which apparently play a secondary role with 
respect to the spherical ones. Both the spherical and the axial anti-nodal 
surfaces fit very well with the packed structure of the viruses in the crystal 
which, accordingly, is expected to have eigenfrequencies related to those of the 
virus. These results open the way to a better understanding of the possibility 
of breaking the capsid using resonant forced oscillations excited, for example, 
by an applied elastic shock or by irradiation with femtosecond laser pulses, as 
already realised by K.-T. Tsen and co-workers. An alternative `plywood' model 
connected to the extreme elastic properties of the capsid is also considered.

Role of temperature and Suwannee River natural organic matter on inactivation 
kinetics of rotavirus and bacteriophage MS2 by solar irradiation.

United States.

Although the sunlight-mediated inactivation of viruses has been recognized as an 
important process that controls surface water quality, the mechanisms of virus 
inactivation by sunlight are not yet clearly understood. We investigated the 
synergistic role of temperature and Suwannee River natural organic matter 
(SRNOM), an exogenous sensitizer, for sunlight-mediated inactivation of porcine 
rotavirus and MS2 bacteriophage. Upon irradiation by a full spectrum of 
simulated sunlight in the absence of SRNOM and in the temperature range of 14-42 
°C, high inactivation rate constants, k(obs), of MS2 (k(obs) ≤ 3.8 h(-1) or 
1-log(10) over 0.6 h) and rotavirus (k(obs) ≤ 11.8 h(-1) or ∼1-log(10) over 0.2 
h) were measured. A weak temperature (14-42 °C) dependence of k(obs) values was 
observed for both viruses irradiated by the full sunlight spectrum. Under the 
same irradiation condition, the presence of SRNOM reduced the inactivation of 
both viruses due to attenuation of lower wavelengths of the simulated sunlight. 
For rotavirus and MS2 solutions irradiated by only UVA and visible light in the 
absence of SRNOM, inactivation kinetics were slow (k(obs) < 0.3 h(-1) or 
<1-log(10) unit reduction over 7 h) and temperature-independent for the range 
considered. Conversely, under UVA and visible light irradiation and in the 
presence of SRNOM, temperature-dependent inactivation of MS2 was observed. For 
rotavirus, the SRNOM-mediated exogenous inactivation was only important at 
temperatures >33 °C, with low rotavirus k(obs) values (k(obs) ≈ 0.2 h(-1); 
1-log(10) unit reduction over 12 h) for the temperature range of 14-33 °C. These 
k(obs) values increased to 0.5 h(-1) at 43 °C and 1.5 h(-1) (1-log(10) reduction 
over 1.6 h) at 50 °C. While SRNOM-mediated exogenous inactivation of MS2 was 
triggered by singlet oxygen, the presence of hydrogen peroxide was important for 
rotavirus inactivation in the 40-50 °C range.

Optimization study of a hybrid alum coagulation-membrane filtration system for 
virus removal.

Singapore, 1 Engineering Drive 1, Singapore 117576, Singapore.

Due to the intrinsically small sizes of enteric viruses (20-100 nm) and their 
relatively high resistance to most disinfectants, detection of viruses in 
treated drinking water is not a rare phenomenon. This study therefore evaluates 
various aspects involved in a hybrid alum coagulation-ultrafiltration (UF) 
system for virus removal. Coagulant doses (0, 1 and 10 mg Al(3+)/L) and pH 
conditions relevant to drinking water (pH 6-8) were investigated. With this 
hybrid system, removal was not attributable merely to MS2 adsorption to flocs 
and subsequent retention by UF membranes. MS2 removal comprises of inactivation 
by the effect of pH and coagulant and subsequently, rejection of 
virus-associated flocs by UF membrane. Coagulation with 1 mg Al(3+)/L at pH 6 
and 7 resulted in an overall reduction brought about by an average of 0.62 log 
inactivation via the pH effect, 1.2 log inactivation by alum coagulant, and >5.4 
log rejection by the 100 kDa polyethersulfone UF membrane. In contrast, 
negligible upstream inactivation was noted with a coagulant dose of 1 mg 
Al(3+)/L at pH 8, but 5.8 log rejection was attained with downstream UF 
filtration. By optimizing the conditions appropriate for upstream inactivation 
and subsequent membrane rejection, virus removal efficiencies can be enhanced.

Microbial water quality before and after the repair of a failing onsite 
wastewater treatment system adjacent to coastal waters.

AIMS: The objective was to assess the impacts of repairing a failing onsite 
wastewater treatment system (OWTS, i.e., septic system) as related to coastal 
microbial water quality.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Wastewater, groundwater and surface water were monitored 
for environmental parameters, faecal indicator bacteria (total coliforms, 
Escherichia coli, enterococci) and the viral tracer MS2 before and after 
repairing a failing OWTS. MS2 results using plaque enumeration and quantitative 
reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) often agreed, but 
inhibition limited the qRT-PCR assay sensitivity. Prerepair, MS2 persisted in 
groundwater and was detected in the nearby creek; postrepair, it was not 
detected. In groundwater, total coliform concentrations were lower and E. coli 
was not detected, while enterococci concentrations were similar to prerepair 
levels. E. coli and enterococci surface water concentrations were elevated both 
before and after the repair.
CONCLUSIONS: Repairing the failing OWTS improved groundwater microbial water 
quality, although persistence of bacteria in surface water suggests that the 
OWTS was not the singular faecal contributor to adjacent coastal waters. A suite 
of tracers is needed to fully assess OWTS performance in treating microbial 
contaminants and related impacts on receiving waters. Molecular methods like 
qRT-PCR have potential but require optimization.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: This is the first before and after study of a 
failing OWTS and provides guidance on selection of microbial tracers and 
methods.

parasites from reclaimed water.

Hollow-fiber ultrafiltration (UF) is a technique that has been reported to be 
effective for recovering a diverse array of microbes from water, and may also be 
potentially useful for microbial monitoring of effluent from water reclamation 
facilities. However, few data are available to indicate the potential 
limitations and efficacy of the UF technique for treated wastewater. In this 
study, recovery efficiencies were determined for various options available for 
performing the tangential-flow UF technique, including hollow-fiber ultrafilter 
(i.e., dialyzer) type, ultrafilter pre-treatment (i.e., blocking), and elution. 
MS2 and ΦX174 bacteriophages, Clostridium perfringens spores, Escherichia coli, 
and Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts were seeded into 10-L reclaimed water samples 
to evaluate UF options. Then a single UF protocol was established and studied 
using seeded and non-seeded 100-L samples from two water reclamation facilities 
in Georgia, USA. Baxter Exeltra Plus 210 and Fresenius F200NR dialyzers were 
found to provide significantly higher microbial recovery than Minntech HPH 1400 
hemoconcentrators. The selected final UF method incorporated use of a 
non-blocked ultrafilter for UF followed by elution using a surfactant-based 
solution. For 10-L samples, this method achieved recovery efficiencies of 
greater than 50% recovery of seeded viruses, bacteria, and parasites. There was 
no significant difference in overall microbial recovery efficiency when the 
method was applied to 10- and 100-L samples. In addition, detection levels for 
pathogens in seeded 100-L reclaimed water samples were 1000 PFU HAV, 10,000 GI 
norovirus particles, <500 Salmonella and <200 Cryptosporidium oocysts. These 
data demonstrate that UF can be an effective technique for recovering diverse 
microbes in reclaimed water to monitor and improve effluent water quality in 
wastewater treatment plants.

The main objective of this study was to evaluate the combined effects of grain 
size and pore water velocity on the transport in water saturated porous media of 
three waterborne fecal indicator organisms (Escherichia coli, MS2, and ΦX174) in 
laboratory-scale columns packed with clean quartz sand. Three different grain 
sizes and three pore water velocities were examined and the attachment behavior 
of Escherichia coli, MS2, and ΦX174 onto quartz sand was evaluated. The mass 
recoveries of the biocolloids examined were shown to be highest for Escherichia 
coli and lowest for MS2. However, no obvious relationships between mass 
recoveries and water velocity or grain size could be established from the 
experimental results. The observed mean dispersivity values for each sand grain 
size were smaller for bacteria than coliphages, but higher for MS2 than ΦX174. 
The single collector removal and collision efficiencies were quantified using 
the classical colloid filtration theory. Furthermore, theoretical collision 
efficiencies were estimated only for E. coli by the 
Interaction-Force-Boundary-Layer, and Maxwell approximations. Better agreement 
between the experimental and Maxwell theoretical collision efficiencies were 
observed.

inactivation.

A composting toilet using sawdust as a matrix has the potential to trap 
pathogens that might occasionally be contained in human feces. Therefore, care 
should be taken when handling the sawdust. It should also be noted that 
pathogenic viruses tend to have stronger tolerance than pathogenic bacteria. The 
fates of several species of coliphages, T4, lambda, Qbeta and MS2, in sawdust 
were investigated as a viral model. The fates of coliphages were significantly 
different among them, and they changed in response to temperature and the water 
content of the sawdust. As the results, T4 coliphage had the strongest tolerance 
and Qbeta had the weakest one in sawdust. It was estimated the days required to 
decrease virus to a safe level based on a risk assessment. According to the 
rates of Qbeta and T4, 15 days and 167 days were required respectively for a 
safe level of infection risk based on actually operated composting toilet 
condition. Thus, it was significantly different depending on the species and 
sawdust conditions.

Removal of bacteriophage MS2 from aqueous solution using Mg-Fe layered double 
hydroxides.

The objective of this study was to investigate the removal of bacteriophage MS2 
from aqueous solution using Mg-Fe layered double hydroxides (LDHs). Batch 
experiments were performed under various experimental conditions to examine 
bacteriophage removal with LDHs. The bacteriophage was enumerated by the plaque 
assay method. Results showed that among the Mg-Fe LDHs calcined at different 
temperatures (105, 300, 500, 700 ° C), Mg-Fe-300 LDH had the highest removal 
capacity at (2.34 ± 0.01) × 10(8) pfu/g with a removal percent of 99.44 ± 0.48 
%. This result could be attributed to the fact that calcination could alter 
chemical compositions and physical properties of Mg-Fe LDHs. Kinetic experiments 
indicated that the removal of MS2 by Mg-Fe-300 LDH was a fast process, reaching 
equilibrium within 60 min. Results also showed that the effect of solution pH on 
MS2 removal by Mg-Fe-300 LDH was minimal at pH 4.0-9.0. The influence of anions 
(NO(3)(-), SO(4)(2-), CO(3)(2-), HPO(4(2-); concentrations 1-100 mg/L) on the 
removal of bacteriophage was important. SO(4)(2-), CO(3)(2-), and HPO(4)(2-) 
influenced removal due to their competition with bacteriophage at the sorption 
sites, while the effect of NO(3)(-) was negligible. Generally, the impact of the 
anions was in the order of NO(3)(-) < SO(4)(2-) < CO(3) (2-) < HPO(4)(4) (2-). 
This study improves our knowledge of potential applications of LDHs as 
adsorbents for virus removal in water treatment.

Reaerosolization of MS2 bacteriophage from an N95 filtering facepiece respirator 
by simulated coughing.

Protective Technology Laboratory, Pittsburgh, PA 15236, USA.

The supply of N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) may not be adequate to 
match demand during a pandemic outbreak. One possible strategy to maintain 
supplies in healthcare settings is to extend FFR use for multiple patient 
encounters; however, contaminated FFRs may serve as a source for the airborne 
transmission of virus particles. In this study, reaerosolization of virus 
particles from contaminated FFRs was examined using bacteriophage MS2 as a 
surrogate for airborne pathogenic viruses. MS2 was applied to FFRs as droplets 
or droplet nuclei. A simulated cough (370 l min(-1) peak flow) provided reverse 
airflow through the contaminated FFR. The number and size of the reaerosolized 
particles were measured using gelatin filters and an Andersen Cascade Impactor 
(ACI). Two droplet nuclei challenges produced higher percentages of 
reaerosolized particles (0.21 and 0.08%) than a droplet challenge (<0.0001%). 
Overall, the ACI-determined size distribution of the reaerosolized particles was 
larger than the characterized loading virus aerosol. This study demonstrates 
that only a small percentage of viable MS2 viruses was reaerosolized from FFRs 
by reverse airflow under the conditions evaluated, suggesting that the risks of 
exposure due to reaerosolization associated with extended use can be considered 
negligible for most respiratory viruses. However, risk assessments should be 
updated as new viruses emerge and better workplace exposure data becomes 
available.

11794-3400, United States.

A multilayered nanofibrous microfiltration (MF) membrane system with high flux, 
low pressure drop, and high retention capability against both bacteria and 
bacteriophages (a virus model) was developed by impregnating ultrafine cellulose 
nanowhiskers (diameter about 5 nm) into an electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) 
nanofibrous scaffold (fiber diameter about 150 nm) supported by a poly(ethylene 
terephthalate) (PET) nonwoven substrate (fiber diameter about 20 μm). The 
cellulose nanowhiskers were anchored on the PAN nanofiber surface, forming a 
cross-linked nanostructured mesh with very high surface-to-volume ratio and a 
negatively charged surface. The mean pore size and pore size distribution of 
this MF system could be adjusted by the loading of cellulose nanowhiskers, where 
the resulting membrane not only possessed good mechanical properties but also 
high surface charge density confirmed by the conductivity titration and zeta 
potential measurements. The results indicated that a test cellulose 
nanowhisker-based MF membrane exhibited 16 times higher adsorption capacity 
against a positively charged dye over a commercial nitrocellulose-based MF 
membrane. This experimental membrane also showed full retention capability 
against bacteria, for example, E. coli and B. diminuta (log reduction value 
(LRV) larger than 6) and decent retention against bacteriophage MS2 (LRV larger 
than 2).

Attachment of bacteriophages MS2 and ΦX174 onto kaolinite and montmorillonite: 
extended-DLVO interactions.

This study aims to gain insights into the interaction of virus particles with 
clay colloids. Bacteriophages MS2 and ΦX174 were used as model viruses and 
kaolinite (KGa-1b) and montmorillonite (STx-1b) as model colloids. The 
experimental data obtained from batch experiments of MS2 and ΦX174 attachment 
onto KGa-1b and STx-1b suggested that virus attachment is adequately described 
by the Freundlich isotherm equation. Both MS2 and ΦX174 were attached in greater 
amounts onto KGa-1b than STx-1b with MS2 having greater affinity than ΦX174 for 
both clays. Furthermore, extended-DLVO interaction energy calculations explained 
that the attachment of viruses onto model clay colloids was primarily caused by 
hydrophobic interaction. The theoretical and experimental results of this study 
were found to be in good agreement with previous findings.

Ceramic filter candles, based on the natural material diatomaceous earth, are 
widely used to purify water at the point-of-use. Although such depth filters are 
known to improve drinking water quality by removing human pathogenic protozoa 
and bacteria, their removal regarding viruses has rarely been investigated. 
These filters have relatively large pore diameters compared to the physical 
dimension of viruses. However, viruses may be retained by adsorption mechanisms 
due to intermolecular and surface forces. Here, we use three types of 
bacteriophages to investigate their removal during filtration and batch 
experiments conducted at different pH values and ionic strengths. Theoretical 
models based on DLVO-theory are applied in order to verify experimental results 
and assess surface forces involved in the adsorptive process. This was done by 
calculation of interaction energies between the filter surface and the viruses. 
For two small spherically shaped viruses (MS2 and PhiX174), these filters showed 
no significant removal. In the case of phage PhiX174, where attractive 
interactions were expected, due to electrostatic attraction of oppositely 
charged surfaces, only little adsorption was reported in the presence of 
divalent ions. Thus, we postulate the existence of an additional repulsive force 
between PhiX174 and the filter surface. It is hypothesized that such an 
additional energy barrier originates from either the phage's specific knobs that 
protrude from the viral capsid, enabling steric interactions, or hydration 
forces between the two hydrophilic interfaces of virus and filter. However, a 
larger-sized, tailed bacteriophage of the family Siphoviridae was removed by log 
2 to 3, which is explained by postulating hydrophobic interactions.

Performance of conventional and antimicrobial-treated filtering facepiece 
respirators challenged with biological aerosols.

Author information:
(1)Department of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical 
Center, Omaha, NE, Nebraska, USA.

This study evaluated the filtration performance of four commercially available 
models of National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified 
filtering facepiece respirators (FFR) against both biological and inert aerosols 
at a flow rate of 85 L/min. Conventional N95 and P100 FFRs and two antimicrobial 
(AM)-treated FFRs (an N95 and a P95, both with iodine-based AM treatments) were 
tested for both physical penetration (PEN(P)) and viable penetration (PEN(V)) 
with three different bioaerosols, including MS2 bacteriophage virus, and the 
spores and vegetative cells of Bacillus atrophaeus bacteria, in addition to 
inert sodium chloride (NaCl) aerosol. For each FFR model, the PEN(P) measured 
with NaCl was predictive of its MS2 PEN(P), and it was observed that spores and 
bacteria aerosols were also filtered similarly to the inert aerosol. For both 
conventional FFRs, up to a 1-log reduction in PEN(V) in comparison with PEN(P) 
was observed and attributed to the experimental variability of the test system. 
For both models of AM-FFRs, no statistically significant differences between 
PEN(V) and PEN(P) for any of the three different bioaerosol challenges were 
observed. Thus, no bioaerosol filtration enhancement over the conventional FFRs 
was detected for either iodine-based AM-FFR. In the absence of any standardized 
test methods, we recommend that future studies evaluating the filtration 
performance of AM-treated FFRs incorporate the experimental best practices 
described herein.

The inactivation of phages MS2, ΦX174 and PR772 using UV and solar 
photocatalysis.

College, Dublin 2, Ireland. missted@tcd.ie

The photolytic and photocatalytic disinfection of three bacteriophages (MS2, 
ΦX174 and PR772) under both artificial UV irradiation and natural sunlight was 
studied. A large variation was seen in the relative responses of phages to the 
two light sources, while solar photocatalysis showed promising disinfection 
capabilities for all three phages. Under artificial UV, the resistance of phages 
to both photolytic and artificial treatment was found to decrease in the 
following order: PR772>ΦX174>MS2. Indeed, 3-log inactivation of PR772 was not 
achieved after 25 h of illumination in either the absence or presence of 
catalyst. Under solar treatment, PR772 was inactivated far more readily, 3-log 
inactivation being achieved within an hour in the presence of catalyst in two 
trials. It is thought that the variation in solar intensity during the trials 
had a major effect on disinfection rates, as kinetics for phages varied 
considerably under different weather conditions.

The deposition of bacteriophage MS2 on bare and clay-coated silica surfaces was 
examined in both monovalent (NaCl) and divalent (CaCl(2) and MgCl(2)) solutions 
under a wide range of environmentally relevant ionic strength and pH conditions 
by utilizing a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D). Two types 
of clay, bentonite and kaolinite, were concerned in this study. To better 
understand MS2 deposition mechanisms, QCM-D data were complemented by zeta 
potentials measurements and Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) interaction 
forces calculation. In both monovalent and divalent solutions, deposition 
efficiencies of MS2 increased with increasing ionic strength both on bare and 
clay-coated surfaces, which agreed with the trends of interaction forces between 
MS2 and solid surface and thus was consistent with DLVO theory. The presence of 
divalent ions (Ca(2+) and Mg(2+)) in solutions greatly increased virus 
deposition on both silica and clay deposited surfaces. Coating silica surfaces 
with clay minerals, either kaolinite or bentonite, could significantly increase 
MS2 deposition.

[Water treatment from viruses using heterogeneous sensitizer based on 
polycationic aluminum phthalocyanine].

[Article in Russian]

Nedachin AE, Kuznetsova NA, Dmitrieva RA, Doskina TV, Iuzhakova OA, Kaliia OL, 
Maksimkina TN.

The authors propose a new heterogeneous photo sensitizer containing aluminum 
tetrakis [bis(cholinyl)phenylthio)] phthalocyanine grafted onto silica as an 
active phase. A poliovirus type 1 LSc2ab and RNA-containing phage MS2 model was 
used to show that the sensitizer had photo decontaminating activity against 
viruses and may be used to purify water from viral contamination. The mechanism 
for removal of viruses from water is two-step and involves the adsorption of the 
virus on the heterogeneous sensitizer particles and the photodynamic 
inactivation of the adsorbed virus.

Solar water disinfection (SODIS) of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., and MS2 
coliphage: effects of additives and alternative container materials.

Berkeley, CA 94720-1710, USA. mbfisher@gmail.com

The use of alternative container materials and added oxidants accelerated the 
inactivation of MS2 coliphage and Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp. 
bacteria during solar water disinfection (SODIS) trials. Specifically, bottles 
made from polypropylene copolymer (PPCO), a partially UVB-transparent plastic, 
resulted in three-log inactivation of these organisms in approximately half the 
time required for disinfection in bottles made from PET, polycarbonate, or 
Tritan(®), which absorb most UVB light. Furthermore, the addition of 125 mg/L 
sodium percarbonate in combination with either citric acid or copper plus 
ascorbate tended to accelerate inactivation by factors of 1.4-19. Finally, it 
was observed that the inactivation of E. coli and enterococci derived from local 
wastewater was far slower than the inactivation of laboratory-cultured E. coli 
and Enterococcus spp., while the inactivation of MS2 was slowest of all. These 
results highlight the importance of UVB in SODIS under certain conditions, and 
also the greater sunlight resistance of some viruses and of bacteria of fecal 
origin, as compared to the laboratory-cultured bacteria commonly used to model 
their inactivation. Furthermore, this study illustrates promising new avenues 
for accelerating the inactivation of bacteria and viruses by solar disinfection.

Photoinactivation of virus on iron-oxide coated sand: enhancing inactivation in 
sunlit waters.

Adsorption onto iron oxides can enhance the removal of waterborne viruses in 
constructed wetlands and soils. If reversible adsorption is not coupled with 
inactivation, however, infective viruses may be released when changes in 
solution conditions cause desorption. The goals of this study were to 
investigate the release of infective bacteriophages MS2 and ΦX174 (two human 
viral indicators) after adsorption onto an iron oxide coated sand (IOCS), and to 
promote viral inactivation by exploiting the photoreactive properties of the 
IOCS. The iron oxide coating greatly enhanced viral adsorption (adsorption 
densities up to ≈ 10(9) infective viruses/g IOCS) onto the sand, but had no 
affect on infectivity. Viruses that were adsorbed onto IOCS under control 
conditions (pH 7.5, 10 mM Tris, 1250 μS/cm) were released into solution in an 
infective state with increases in pH and humic acid concentrations. The exposure 
of IOCS-adsorbed MS2 to sunlight irradiation caused significant inactivation via 
a photocatalytic mechanism in both buffered solutions and in wastewater samples 
(4.9 log(10) and 3.3 log(10) inactivation after 24-h exposure, respectively). 
Unlike MS2, ΦX174 inactivation was not enhanced by photocatalysis. In summary, 
IOCS enhanced the separation of viruses from the water column, and additionally 
provided a photocatalytic mechanism to promote inactivation of one of the 
surrogates studied. These qualities make it an attractive option for improving 
viral control strategies in constructed wetlands.

Microorganisms are retained by ultrafiltration (UF) membranes mainly due to size 
exclusion. The sizes of viruses and membrane pores are close to each other and 
retention of viruses can be guaranteed only if the precise pore diameter is 
known. Unfortunately and rather surprisingly, there is no direct method to 
determine the membrane pore size. As a result, the UF membranes are not trusted 
to remove the viruses, and the treatment plants are required to enhance viral 
disinfection. Here we propose a new, simple and effective method for UF pore 
size determination using aquasols of gold and silver nanoparticles. We 
synthesized highly monodispersed suspensions ranging in diameter from 3 to 50 
nm, which were later transferred through polymer and ceramic UF membranes. The 
retention percentage was plotted against the particle diameter to determine the 
pore size for which a membrane has a retention capability of 50, 90 and 100%. 
The d(50), d(90) and d(100) values were compared with data obtained from 
conventional transmembrane flux, polyethylene glycol, and dextran tests, and 
with the retention of phi X 174 and MS2 bacteriophages. The absolute pore size, 
d(100), for the majority of tested UF membranes is within 40-50 nm, and can only 
be detected with the new tests. The average 1.2 log retention of hydrophilic phi 
X 174 was predicted accurately by models based on the virus hydrodynamic radii 
and d(100) pore size. The 2.5 log MS2 retention suggests hydrophobic 
interactions in addition to simple ball-through-cylinder geometry.

highly permeable subsoils.

Environmental Engineering, University of Dublin, Trinity College, Dublin 2,

An extensive field study on percolation areas receiving both septic tank and 
secondary treated on-site effluents from single houses in Ireland was carried 
out to investigate the attenuation capacity of highly permeable subsoils with 
respect to E. coli bacteria and spiked bacteriophages (MS2, ΦX174 and PR772). 
The development of biomats across the percolation areas receiving the secondary 
effluent was restricted compared to the percolation area receiving septic tank 
effluent, promoting a much higher areal hydraulic loading which created 
significant differences in the potential microbiological loading to groundwater. 
Greatest E. coli removal in the subsoil occurred within the first 0.35 m of 
unsaturated subsoil for all effluent types. Analysis showed, however, that more 
evidence of faecal contamination occurred at depth in the subsoils receiving 
secondary treated effluents than that receiving septic tank effluent, despite 
the lower bacterial influent load. All three bacteriophages were reduced to 
their minimum detection limit (<10 PFU/mL) at a depth of 0.95 m below the 
percolation trenches receiving septic tank effluent, although isolated 
incidences of ΦX174 and PR772 were measured below one trench. However again, 
slightly higher breakthroughs of MS2 and PR772 contamination were detected at 
the same depth under the trenches receiving secondary treated effluent.

Development of a microRNA delivery system based on bacteriophage MS2 virus-like 
particles.

Sciences, Beijing, China.

Recently, microRNA (miRNA)-mediated RNA interference has been developed as a 
useful tool in gene function analysis and gene therapy. A major obstacle in 
miRNA-mediated RNAi is cellular delivery, which requires an efficient and 
flexible delivery system. The self-assembly of the MS2 bacteriophage capsids has 
been used to develop virus-like particles (VLPs) for RNA and drug delivery. 
However, MS2 VLP-mediated miRNA delivery has not yet been reported. We therefore 
used an Escherichia coli expression system to produce the pre-miR 146a contained 
MS2 VLPs, and then conjugated these particles with HIV-1 Tat(47-57) peptide. The 
conjugated MS2 VLPs effectively transferred the packaged pre-miR146a RNA into 
various cells and tissues, with 0.92-14.76-fold higher expression of miR-146a in 
vitro and about two-fold higher expression in vivo, and subsequently suppressed 
its targeting gene. These findings suggest that MS2 VLPs can be used as a novel 
vehicle in miRNA delivery systems, and may have applications in gene therapy.

A comparison of different concentration methods for the detection of viruses 
present in bottled waters and those adsorbed to water bottle surfaces.

France.

This study aimed to provide a tool for selecting the best approach to 
virological testing of bottled waters. Different methods were investigated. 
Method A examined the recovery of virus RNA following in situ lysis of virus 
particles in the aqueous phase and of those adhered to the bottle wall, method B 
examined the recovery of virus RNA following lysis of virus particles in the 
aqueous phase, and method C examined the recovery of intact virus particles. 
Method C generated the lowest genome recovery rate regardless of the water and 
virus type used, therefore comparison was mainly conducted between methods A and 
B.The effects of independent variables on the viral RNA recovery rate were 
determined by full factorial design. These independent variables included three 
waters (differing in mineral composition), four viruses (poliovirus 1, hepatitis 
A virus, Norovirus, and the MS2 phage), three incubation times (0, 10, and 20 
days), and two methods (A and B). According to the results, each factor 
influenced the recovery rate of viral RNA with the exception of incubation time. 
Statistical analysis identified interactions between the factors. The strongest 
interactions involved the water and virus types, as well as the methods. The 
results suggested that method A should be used for the concentration and 
detection of hepatitis A virus, regardless of the divalent cation concentration 
of the bottled water. Method A was most suitable for water with the highest 
mineral content (divalent cation concentration of 250 mgL(-1)) and for the 
analysis of viruses capable of adsorbing onto the bottle walls (Poliovirus 1). 
Method B could be recommended for the analysis of water whose cation 
concentration is unknown.

Mechanisms of virus control during iron electrocoagulation--microfiltration of 
surface water.

Tanneru CT(1), Chellam S.

77204-4003, USA.

Results from a laboratory-scale study evaluating virus control by a hybrid iron 
electrocoagulation - microfiltration process revealed only 1.0-1.5 log MS2 
bacteriophage reduction even at relatively high iron dosages (≈ 13 mg/L as Fe) 
for natural surface water containing moderate natural organic matter (NOM) 
concentrations (4.5 mg/L dissolved organic carbon, DOC). In contrast, much 
greater reductions were measured (6.5-log at pH 6.4 and 4-log at pH 7.5) at 
similar iron dosages for synthetic water that was devoid of NOM. Quantitative 
agreement with Faraday's law with 2-electron transfer and speciation with 
phenanthroline demonstrated electrochemical generation of soluble ferrous iron. 
Near quantitative extraction of viruses by dissolving flocs formed in synthetic 
water provided direct evidence of their removal by sorption and enmeshment onto 
iron hydroxide flocs. In contrast, only approximately 1% of the viruses were 
associated with the flocs formed in natural water consistent with the measured 
poor removals. 1-2 logs of virus inactivation were also observed in the 
electrochemical cell for synthetic water (no NOM) but not for surface water (4.5 
mg/L DOC). Sweep flocculation was the dominant destabilization mechanism since 
the ζ potential did not reach zero even when 6-log virus reductions were 
achieved. Charge neutralization only played a secondary role since ζ potential → 
0 with increasing iron electrocoagulant dosage. Importantly, virus removal from 
synthetic water decreased when Suwanee River Humic Acid was added. Therefore, 
NOM present in natural waters appears to reduce the effectiveness of iron 
electrocoagulation pretreatment to microfiltration for virus control by 
complexing ferrous ions. This inhibits (i) Fe(2+) oxidation, precipitation, and 
virus destabilization and (ii) virus inactivation through reactive oxygen 
species intermediates or by direct interactions with Fe(2+) ions.

Contamination of food contact surfaces with pathogens is considered an important 
vehicle for the indirect transmission of food-borne diseases. Five different 
cleaning cloths were assessed for the ability to remove viruses from food 
contact surfaces (stainless steel surface and nonporous solid surface) and to 
transfer viruses back to these surfaces. Cleaning cloths evaluated include two 
different cellulose/cotton cloths, one microfiber cloth, one nonwoven cloth, and 
one cotton terry bar towel. Four viral surrogates (murine norovirus [MNV], 
feline calicivirus [FCV], bacteriophages PRD1 and MS2) were included. Removal of 
FCV from stainless steel was significantly greater (P ≤ 0.05) than that from 
nonporous solid surface, and overall removal of MNV from both surfaces was 
significantly less (P ≤ 0.05) than that of FCV and PRD1. Additionally, the terry 
towel removed significantly fewer total viruses (P ≤ 0.05) than the microfiber 
and one of the cotton/cellulose cloths. The cleaning cloth experiments were 
repeated with human norovirus. For transfer of viruses from cloth to surface, 
both cellulose/cotton cloths and microfiber transferred an average of 3.4 and 
8.5 total PFU, respectively, to both surfaces, and the amounts transferred were 
significantly different (P ≤ 0.05) from those for the nonwoven cloth and terry 
towel (309 and 331 total PFU, respectively). There was no statistically 
significant difference (P > 0.05) in the amount of virus transfer between 
surfaces. These data indicate that while the cleaning cloths assessed here can 
remove viruses from surfaces, some cloths may also transfer a significant amount 
of viruses back to food contact surfaces.

Effective sanitization is important in viral epizootic outbreaks to avoid 
further spread of the pathogen. This study examined thermal inactivation as a 
sanitizing treatment for manure inoculated with highly pathogenic avian 
influenza virus H7N1 and bacteriophages MS2 and 6. Rapid inactivation of highly 
pathogenic avian influenza virus H7N1 was achieved at both mesophilic (35°C) and 
thermophilic (45 and 55°C) temperatures. Similar inactivation rates were 
observed for bacteriophage 6, while bacteriophage MS2 proved too thermoresistant 
to be considered a valuable indicator organism for avian influenza virus during 
thermal treatments. Guidelines for treatment of litter in the event of emergency 
composting can be formulated based on the inactivation rates obtained in the 
study.

We investigated the resistance of murine norovirus (MNV) and coliphage MS2, a 
culturable human norovirus surrogate, to temperature, salt, and pH. Virus 
inactivation was measured by plaque, real-time TaqMan reverse transcription (RT) 
PCR, and long-template RT-PCR assays. Both MNV and MS2 were rapidly inactivated 
at temperatures above 60°C. Similarly, MNV tolerated low salt concentrations 
(0.3% NaCl) to a greater degree than high salt concentrations (3.3 to 6.3% 
NaCl). MNV was relatively resistant to strong acidic conditions (pH 2) and was 
more tolerant of slightly acidic (pH 4) or neutral (pH 7) conditions. In 
contrast, MS2 was resistant to high salinity. Overall, temperature had a greater 
effect on infectivity than salt or low pH. Additionally, temperature and low pH 
had a synergistic effect on MNV infectivity. Both real-time and long-template 
RT-PCR assays significantly underestimated the inactivation by temperature, 
salt, and pH. The inactivation kinetics of both MNV and MS2 under various 
environmental conditions gave a good fit by the Weibull model (R² > 0.9). This 
study suggests both the capacity of infectious human norovirus to persist in the 
face of various environmental conditions and its sensitivity to high 
temperatures, which may provide a mechanism of protection against this virus.

Much research has been dedicated to understanding the molecular basis of UV 
damage to biomolecules, yet many questions remain regarding the specific 
pathways involved. Here we describe a genome-mediated mechanism that causes 
site-specific virus protein cleavage upon UV irradiation. Bacteriophage MS2 was 
disinfected with 254 nm UV, and protein damage was characterized with ESI- and 
MALDI-based FT-ICR, Orbitrap, and TOF mass spectroscopy. Top-down mass 
spectrometry of the products identified the backbone cleavage site as 
Cys46-Ser47 in the virus capsid protein, a location of viral genome-protein 
interaction. The presence of viral RNA was essential to inducing backbone 
cleavage. The similar bacteriophage GA did not exhibit site-specific protein 
cleavage. Based on the major protein fragments identified by accurate mass 
analysis, a cleavage mechanism is proposed by radical formation. The mechanism 
involves initial oxidation of the Cys46 side chain followed by hydrogen atom 
abstraction from Ser47 C(α). Computational protein QM/MM studies confirmed the 
initial steps of the radical mechanism. Collectively, this study describes a 
rare incidence of genome-induced protein cleavage without the addition of 
sensitizers.

The removal of MS2, Qβ and GA, F-specific RNA bacteriophages, potential 
surrogates for pathogenic waterborne viruses, was investigated during a 
conventional drinking water treatment at pilot scale by using river water, 
artificially and independently spiked with these bacteriophages. The objective 
of this work is to develop a standard system for assessing the effectiveness of 
drinking water plants with respect to the removal of MS2, Qβ and GA 
bacteriophages by a conventional pre-treatment process 
(coagulation-flocculation-settling-sand filtration) followed or not by an 
ultrafiltration (UF) membrane (complete treatment process). The specific 
performances of three UF membranes alone were assessed by using (i) pre-treated 
water and (ii) 0.1 mM sterile phosphate buffer solution (PBS), spiked with 
bacteriophages. These UF membranes tested in this work were designed for 
drinking water treatment market and were also selected for research purpose. The 
hypothesis serving as base for this study was that the interfacial properties 
for these three bacteriophages, in terms of electrostatic charge and the degree 
of hydrophobicity, could induce variations in the removal performances achieved 
by drinking water treatments. The comparison of the results showed a similar 
behaviour for both MS2 and Qβ surrogates whereas it was particularly atypical 
for the GA surrogate. The infectious character of MS2 and Qβ bacteriophages was 
mostly removed after clarification followed by sand filtration processes (more 
than a 4.8-log reduction) while genomic copies were removed at more than a 
4.0-log after the complete treatment process. On the contrary, GA bacteriophage 
was only slightly removed by clarification followed by sand filtration, with 
less than 1.7-log and 1.2-log reduction, respectively. After the complete 
treatment process achieved, GA bacteriophage was removed with less than 2.2-log 
and 1.6-log reduction, respectively. The effectiveness of the three UF membranes 
tested in terms of bacteriophages removal showed significant differences, 
especially for GA bacteriophage. These results could provide recommendations for 
drinking water suppliers in terms of selection criteria for membranes. MS2 
bacteriophage is widely used as a surrogate for pathogenic waterborne viruses in 
Europe and the United States. In this study, the choice of MS2 bacteriophage as 
the best surrogate to be used for assessment of the effectiveness of drinking 
water treatment in removal of pathogenic waterborne viruses in worst conditions 
is clearly challenged. It was shown that GA bacteriophage is potentially a 
better surrogate as a worst case than MS2. Considering GA bacteriophage as the 
best surrogate in this study, a chlorine disinfection step could guaranteed a 
complete removal of this model and ensure the safety character of drinking water 
plants.

Intramolecular regulation of the sequence-specific mRNA interferase activity of 
MazF fused to a MazE fragment with a linker cleavable by specific proteases.

The genomes of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and hepatitis C virus 
(HCV) consist of single-stranded RNA encoding polyproteins, which are processed 
to individual functional proteins by virus-encoded specific proteases. These 
proteases have been used as targets for drug development. Here, instead of 
targeting these proteases to inhibit viral infection, we utilized the protease 
activity to activate a toxic protein to prevent viral infection. We engineered 
the MazE-MazF antitoxin-toxin system of Escherichia coli to fuse a C-terminal 
41-residue fragment of antitoxin MazE to the N-terminal end of toxin MazF with a 
linker having a specific protease cleavage site for either HIV PR (HIV-1 
protease), NS3 protease (HCV protease), or factor Xa. These fusion proteins 
formed a stable dimer (instead of the MazF(2)-MazE(2)-MazF(2) heterohexamer in 
nature) to inactivate the ACA (sequence)-specific mRNA interferase activity of 
MazF. When the fusion proteins were incubated with the corresponding proteases, 
the MazE fragment was cleaved from the fusion proteins, releasing active MazF, 
which then acted as an ACA-specific mRNA interferase cleaving single-stranded 
MS2 phage RNA. The intramolecular regulation of MazF toxicity by proteases as 
demonstrated may provide a novel approach for preventive and therapeutic 
treatments of infection by HIV-1, HCV, and other single-stranded RNA viruses.

We investigated the use of psoralens and limes to enhance solar disinfection of 
water (SODIS) using an UV lamp and natural sunlight experiments. SODIS 
conditions were replicated using sunlight, 2 L polyethylene terephthalate (PET) 
bottles, and tap water with Escherichia coli, MS2 bacteriophage, and murine 
norovirus (MNV). Psoralens and lime acidity both interact synergistically with 
UV radiation to accelerate inactivation of microbes. Escherichia coli was 
ablated > 6.1 logs by SODIS + Lime Slurry and 5.6 logs by SODIS + Lime Juice in 
30-minute solar exposures, compared with a 1.5 log reduction with SODIS alone (N 
= 3; P < 0.001). MS2 was inactivated > 3.9 logs by SODIS + Lime Slurry, 1.9 logs 
by SODIS + Lime Juice, and 1.4 logs by SODIS in 2.5-hour solar exposures (N = 3; 
P < 0.05). MNV was resistant to SODIS, with < 2 log reductions after 6 hours. 
Efficacy of SODIS against human norovirus should be investigated further.

process-controlled deep sequencing.

BACKGROUND: Animal faeces comprise a community of many different microorganisms 
including bacteria and viruses. Only scarce information is available about the 
diversity of viruses present in the faeces of pigs. Here we describe a protocol, 
which was optimized for the purification of the total fraction of viral 
particles from pig faeces. The genomes of the purified DNA and RNA viruses were 
simultaneously amplified by PCR and subjected to deep sequencing followed by 
bioinformatic analyses. The efficiency of the method was monitored using a 
process control consisting of three bacteriophages (T4, M13 and MS2) with 
different morphology and genome types. Defined amounts of the bacteriophages 
were added to the sample and their abundance was assessed by quantitative PCR 
during the preparation procedure.
RESULTS: The procedure was applied to a pooled faecal sample of five pigs. From 
this sample, 69,613 sequence reads were generated. All of the added 
bacteriophages were identified by sequence analysis of the reads. In total, 7.7% 
of the reads showed significant sequence identities with published viral 
sequences. They mainly originated from bacteriophages (73.9%) and mammalian 
viruses (23.9%); 0.8% of the sequences showed identities to plant viruses. The 
most abundant detected porcine viruses were kobuvirus, rotavirus C, astrovirus, 
enterovirus B, sapovirus and picobirnavirus. In addition, sequences with 
identities to the chimpanzee stool-associated circular ssDNA virus were 
identified. Whole genome analysis indicates that this virus, tentatively 
designated as pig stool-associated circular ssDNA virus (PigSCV), represents a 
novel pig virus.
CONCLUSION: The established protocol enables the simultaneous detection of DNA 
and RNA viruses in pig faeces including the identification of so far unknown 
viruses. It may be applied in studies investigating aetiology, epidemiology and 
ecology of diseases. The implemented process control serves as quality control, 
ensures comparability of the method and may be used for further method 
optimization.

Inactivation rates of the MS2 bacteriophage and (1)O(2) generation rates by four

aqu-nC(60) < C(60)(OH)(6) ≈ C(60)(OH)(24) < C(60)(NH(2))(6). Alterations to 
capsid protein secondary structures and protein oxidation were inferred by 
detecting changes in infrared vibrational frequencies and carbonyl groups 
respectively. MS2 inactivation appears to be the result of loss of capsid 
structural integrity (localized deformation) and the reduced ability to eject 
genomic RNA into its bacterial host. Evidence is also presented for possible 
capsid rupture in MS2 exposed to UV-A illuminated C(60)(NH(2))(6) through TEM 
imagery and detection of RNA infrared fingerprints in ATR-FTIR spectra. 
Fullerene-virus mixtures were also directly visualized in the aqueous phase 
using a novel enhanced darkfield transmission optical microscope fitted with a 
hyperspectral imaging (HSI) spectrometer. Perturbations in intermolecular 
extended chains, HSI, and electrostatic interactions suggest that inactivation 
is a function of the relative proximity between nanoparticles and viruses and 
(1)O(2) generation rate. MS2 log survival ratios were linearly related to CT 
(product of (1)O(2) concentration C and exposure time T) demonstrating the 
applicability of classical Chick-Watson kinetics for all fullerenes employed in 
this study. Results suggest that antiviral properties of fullerenes can be 
increased by adjusting the type of surface functionalization and extent of cage 
derivatization thereby increasing the (1)O(2) generation rate and facilitating 
closer association with biological targets.

in embryonic stem cells.

Single cell imaging studies suggest that transcription is not continuous and 
occurs as discrete pulses of gene activity. To study mechanisms by which 
retroviral transgenes can transcribe to high levels, we used the MS2 system to 
visualize transcriptional dynamics of high expressing proviral integration sites 
in embryonic stem (ES) cells. We established two ES cell lines each bearing a 
single copy, self-inactivating retroviral vector with a strong ubiquitous human 
EF1α gene promoter directing expression of mRFP fused to an MS2-stem-loop array. 
Transfection of MS2-EGFP generated EGFP focal dots bound to the mRFP-MS2 stem 
loop mRNA. These transcription foci colocalized with the transgene integration 
site detected by immunoFISH. Live tracking of single cells for 20 minutes 
detected EGFP focal dots that displayed frequent and rapid fluctuations in 
transcription over periods as short as 25 seconds. Similarly rapid fluctuations 
were detected from focal doublet signals that colocalized with replicated 
proviral integration sites by immunoFISH, consistent with transcriptional pulses 
from sister chromatids. We concluded that retroviral transgenes experience rapid 
transcriptional pulses in clonal ES cell lines that exhibit high level 
expression. These events are directed by a constitutive housekeeping gene 
promoter and may provide precedence for rapid transcriptional pulsing at 
endogenous genes in mammalian stem cells.

Incorporating global features of RNA motifs in predictions for an ensemble of 
secondary structures for encapsidated MS2 bacteriophage RNA.

Plant Biology, University of Oklahoma, Norman, Oklahoma 73019, USA.

The secondary structure of encapsidated MS2 genomic RNA poses an interesting RNA 
folding challenge. Cryoelectron microscopy has demonstrated that encapsidated 
MS2 RNA is well-ordered. Models of MS2 assembly suggest that the RNA 
hairpin-protein interactions and the appropriate placement of hairpins in the 
MS2 RNA secondary structure can guide the formation of the correct icosahedral 
particle. The RNA hairpin motif that is recognized by the MS2 capsid protein 
dimers, however, is energetically unfavorable, and thus free energy predictions 
are biased against this motif. Computer programs called Crumple, Sliding 
Windows, and Assembly provide useful tools for prediction of viral RNA secondary 
structures when the traditional assumptions of RNA structure prediction by free 
energy minimization may not apply. These methods allow incorporation of global 
features of the RNA fold and motifs that are difficult to include directly in 
minimum free energy predictions. For example, with MS2 RNA the experimental data 
from SELEX experiments, crystallography, and theoretical calculations of the 
path for the series of hairpins can be incorporated in the RNA structure 
prediction, and thus the influence of free energy considerations can be 
modulated. This approach thoroughly explores conformational space and generates 
an ensemble of secondary structures. The predictions from this new approach can 
test hypotheses and models of viral assembly and guide construction of complete 
three-dimensional models of virus particles.

Accidental release of biological agents from a bioweapon facility may 
contaminate large areas, possibly causing disastrous environmental consequences. 
To address this issue, novel halogen-containing reactive materials are being 
designed with the added capability to inactivate viable airborne microorganisms. 
This study determined the efficiency of combustion products of such materials to 
inactivate aerosolized bacteria and viruses. Spores of Bacillus atrophaeus and 
MS2 viruses dispersed in dry air were exposed for subsecond time intervals to 
hydrocarbon flames seeded with different reactive powders so that bioaerosol 
particles interacted with the combustion products in a controlled 
high-temperature environment. The experiments were designed to quantify 
differences in the biocidal effects of different reactive material powders 
including Al and Mg, a B•Ti nanocomposite, an 8Al•MoO(3) nanothermite, and a 
novel Al•I(2) nanocomposite. Compared to pure hydrocarbon flame, powder-seeded 
flame (with no iodine) produced about an order of magnitude greater inactivation 
of bacterial spores. The iodine-containing material increased the spore 
inactivation by additional 2 orders of magnitude. The aerosolized MS2 viruses 
(generally not as stress-resistant as spores) were fully inactivated when 
exposed to combustion of either the iodinated or noniodinated powders. Overall, 
the study suggests a great biocidal potential of combustion products generated 
by novel iodine-containing nanocomposite materials.

Viral metagenomic libraries are a promising but previously untapped source of 
new reagent enzymes. Deep sequencing and functional screening of viral 
metagenomic DNA from a near-boiling thermal pool identified clones expressing 
thermostable DNA polymerase (Pol) activity. Among these, 3173 Pol demonstrated 
both high thermostability and innate reverse transcriptase (RT) activity. We 
describe the biochemistry of 3173 Pol and report its use in single-enzyme 
reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Wild-type 3173 Pol contains a proofreading 
3'-5' exonuclease domain that confers high fidelity in PCR. An easier-to-use 
exonuclease-deficient derivative was incorporated into a PyroScript RT-PCR 
master mix and compared to one-enzyme (Tth) and two-enzyme (MMLV RT/Taq) RT-PCR 
systems for quantitative detection of MS2 RNA, influenza A RNA, and mRNA 
targets. Specificity and sensitivity of 3173 Pol-based RT-PCR were higher than 
Tth Pol and comparable to three common two-enzyme systems. The performance and 
simplified set-up make this enzyme a potential alternative for research and 
molecular diagnostics.

Removal of bacteriophages with different surface charges by diverse ceramic 
membrane materials in pilot spiking tests.

This study examines mechanisms for removal of bacteriophages (MS2 and phiX174) 
by ceramic membranes without application of flocculants. The ceramic membranes 
considered included ultra- and microfiltration membranes of different materials. 
Phages were spiked into the feed water in pilot scale tests in a waterworks. The 
membranes with pore sizes of 10 nm provided a 2.5-4.0 log removal of the phages. 
For pore sizes of 50 nm, the log removal dropped to 0.96-1.8. The membrane with 
a pore size of 200 nm did not remove phages. So, the removal of both MS2- and 
phiX174-phages depended on the pore size of the membranes. But apart from pore 
size also other factors influence the removal of phages. Removal was 0.5-0.9 log 
higher for MS2-phages compared with phiX174-phages. Size exclusion seems to be 
the major but not the only mechanism which influences the efficiency of phage 
removal by ceramic membranes.

Effects of relative humidity and spraying medium on UV decontamination of 
filters loaded with viral aerosols.

Gainesville, Florida, USA.

Although respirators and filters are designed to prevent the spread of 
pathogenic aerosols, a stockpile shortage is anticipated during the next flu 
pandemic. Contact transfer and reaerosolization of collected microbes from used 
respirators are also a concern. An option to address these potential problems is 
UV irradiation, which inactivates microbes by dimerizing thymine/uracil in 
nucleic acids. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of 
transmission mode and environmental conditions on decontamination efficiency by 
UV. In this study, filters were contaminated by different transmission pathways 
(droplet and aerosol) using three spraying media (deionized water [DI], beef 
extract [BE], and artificial saliva [AS]) under different humidity levels (30% 
[low relative humidity {LRH}], 60% [MRH], and 90% [HRH]). UV irradiation at 
constant intensity was applied for two time intervals at each relative humidity 
condition. The highest inactivation efficiency (IE), around 5.8 logs, was seen 
for DI aerosols containing MS2 on filters at LRH after applying a UV intensity 
of 1.0 mW/cm(2) for 30 min. The IE of droplets containing MS2 was lower than 
that of aerosols containing MS2. Absorption of UV by high water content and 
shielding of viruses near the center of the aggregate are considered responsible 
for this trend. Across the different media, IEs in AS and in BE were much lower 
than in DI for both aerosol and droplet transmission, indicating that solids 
present in AS and BE exhibited a protective effect. For particles sprayed in a 
protective medium, RH is not a significant parameter.

AIMS: The ability to distinguish between viable and/or infectious 
micro-organisms and inactivated cells is extremely important for correctly 
performing microbial risk assessments. In this study, we evaluated whether 
propidium monoazide (PMA)-qPCR could distinguish between viable and nonviable 
bacteria and viruses.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A PMA-qPCR combined assay was applied to viable and 
inactivated bacteria (Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis) and viruses (MS2 
and murine norovirus [MNV]). PMA, a DNA-intercalating agent, in combination with 
PCR was better able to distinguish between viable and nonviable bacteria and 
viruses than conventional PCR.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a combined PMA-qPCR assay can be used to 
measure the viability of bacterial cells and bacteriophage MS2, but not MNV.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: PMA-qPCR could potentially be used to 
measure the viability of some micro-organisms, including virus. However, a 
thorough evaluation should be performed prior to measuring the viability of 
micro-organisms by PMA-qPCR in a quantitative way.

F-RNA coliphages, part of the gut flora and likely to be deposited on meat along 
with other enteric organisms during carcass dressing and processing, may be 
regarded as an indicator and/or surrogate for potential zoonotic enteric 
viruses. There is no recommended sampling method for viruses on meats and there 
is a lack of information on the attachment of enteric viruses or F-RNA 
coliphages to gauze swabs, cellulose sponges and muscle and fat tissue. The 
objective of this work was to optimize the recovery of MS2 from muscle and fat 
tissue of meat by comparing phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 10% beef extract pH 
7.2, and tryptose phosphate (2.9%) glycine (6%) broth pH 9.5 as eluants. The 
sampling techniques of excision, swabbing with gauze or cellulose sponges were 
compared with homogenizing the inoculated entire muscle or fat surface area. The 
recovery of MS2 from cellulose sponges using beef extract was significantly 
higher (P=0.001) than tryptose phosphate glycine broth which was significantly 
higher (P=0.0001) than PBS. There was no significant difference in the recovery 
between tryptose phosphate glycine broth and beef extract (P=0.92) and there was 
no significant difference between PBS and beef extract (P=0.10) when MS2 was 
recovered from gauze. No significant differences were observed between the 
different eluants with muscle tissue (P=0.91). When MS2 was recovered from 
muscle tissue with beef extract significant differences were observed (P=0.002); 
the sampling techniques of homogenizing the entire sample (56%) was equal to 
excision (43%) (P=0.23) and swabbing with a cellulose sponge (38%) (P=0.06) 
which were significantly higher than swabbing with gauze (28%), a second 
grouping of means indicated that homogenizing the entire sample was 
significantly higher than the other three sampling techniques. When MS2 was 
recovered from fat, significant differences were observed (P=0.000); 
homogenizing the entire sample (78%) was equal to excision (74%), which were 
significantly higher than swabbing with gauze (49%) or cellulose sponge (29%). 
The recovery of MS2 from meat is affected by the sampling technique. When 
choosing a nondestructive sampling method such as a cellulose sponge, a higher 
recovery can be obtained with beef extract as an eluant.

The objective of this study was to investigate the removal of bacteriophages in 
Mg/Al layered double hydroxide (LDH). Batch experiments were performed with 
bacteriophage MS2 in a powder form of Mg/Al LDH under various LDH doses. Column 
experiments were also performed under flow-through condition with bacteriophages 
MS2 and phiX174 in Mg/Al LDH immobilized on sand surfaces. Batch tests 
demonstrated that the powder form of Mg/Al LDH was effective in removing MS2 
with the removal capacity of 2.2 × 10(8) plaque forming unit (pfu)/g under the 
given experimental conditions (LDH dose = 2 g/L; initial MS2 concentration = 
4.61 × 10(5) pfu/mL). Column experiments showed that the log removal of phiX174 
was 4.40 in columns containing 100% Mg/Al LDH-coated sand while it was 0.05 in 
100% quartz sand. These findings indicated that Mg/Al LDH-coated sand was 
effective in removing bacteriophages compared with sand. A more than 4 log 
removal (=5.44) of MS2 was achieved in 100% Mg/Al LDH-coated sand. This study 
demonstrates the potential application of Mg/Al LDH for virus removal in water 
treatment.

Nine different membrane bioreactor (MBR) systems with different process 
configurations (submerged and external), membrane geometries (hollow-fiber, 
flat-sheet, and tubular), membrane materials (polyethersulfone (PES), 
polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)) and membrane 
nominal pore sizes (0.03-0.2 μm) were evaluated to assess the impact of influent 
microbial concentration, membrane pore size and membrane material and geometries 
on removal of microbial indicators by MBR technology. The log removal values 
(LRVs) for microbial indicators increased as the influent concentrations 
increased. Among the wide range of MBR systems evaluated, the total and fecal 
coliform bacteria and indigenous MS-2 coliphage were detected in 32, 9 and 15% 
of the samples, respectively; the 50th percentile LRVs were measured at 6.6, 5.9 
and 4.5 logs, respectively. The nominal pore sizes of the membranes, membrane 
materials and geometries did not show a strong correlation with the LRVs.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), once relegated to junk products of the genome, 
are becoming better appreciated for the myriad functions they play in cellular 
processes. It is clear that for most of the cases studied, lncRNAs carry out 
their functions at least in part through interactions with proteins. Here we 
present two complementary biochemical methods for the analysis of 
lncRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein complexes, hereafter referred to as RNPs. 
The first strategy offers users the ability to purify RNPs based on a protein 
component and to analyze the spectrum of lncRNAs, other proteins, and, if 
present, other types of RNAs that are bound to it. The second makes use of a 
bacteriophage MS2 binding-site affinity-handle grafted onto an lncRNA of 
interest to investigate the proteins and RNAs that co-purify with the tagged 
RNA.

Knowing when, and to what extent co-extracted inhibitors interfere with 
molecular RNA diagnostic assays is of utmost importance. The QIAamp Viral RNA 
Mini Kit (A); MagNA Pure LC2.0 Automatic extractor (B); KingFisher (C); and 
NucliSENS EasyMag (D) RNA extraction systems were evaluated for extraction 
efficiency and co-purification of inhibitors from stool suspensions. Real-Time 
Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) of MS-2 coliphage 
spiked into each system's lysis buffer served as an external control for both. 
Cycle thresholds (Cts) of the MS2 were determined for RNA extracted from stool 
suspensions containing unknown (n = 93) or varying amounts of inhibitors 
(n = 92). Stool suspensions from the latter group were also used to determine 
whether MS-2 and enterovirus rRT-PCR inhibitions were correlated. Specifically 
23 RNA extracts from stool suspensions were spiked with enterovirus RNA after 
extraction and 13 of these stool suspension were spiked with intact enterovirus 
before extraction. MS2 rRT-PCR inhibition varied for RNAs extracted by the 
different systems. Inhibition was noted in 12 (13.0%), 26 (28.3%), 7 (7.6%), and 
7 (7.6%) of the first 93 RNA extracts, and 58 (63.0%), 55 (59.8%), 37 (40.2%) 
and 30 (32.6%) of the second 92 extracts for A, B, C, and D, respectively. 
Furthermore, enterovirus rRT-PCR inhibition correlated with MS2 rRT-PCR 
inhibition for added enterovirus RNA or virus particles. In conclusion, rRT-PCR 
for MS-2 RNA is a good predictor of inhibition of enterovirus RNA extracted from 
stool suspensions. EasyMag performed the best, however all four extraction 
methods were suitable provided that external controls identified problematic 
samples.

Virus inactivation is one of the most important factors that controls virus fate 
and transport in the subsurface. In this study the inactivation of viruses in 
the presence of quartz sand was examined. The bacteriophages MS2 and ΦX174 were 
used as model viruses. Experiments were performed at 4°C and 20°C, under 
constant controlled conditions, to investigate the effect of virus type, 
temperature, sand size, and initial virus concentration on virus inactivation. 
The experimental virus inactivation data were satisfactorily represented by a 
pseudo-first order expression with time-dependent rate coefficients. 
Furthermore, the results indicated that virus inactivation was substantially 
affected by the ambient temperature and initial virus concentration. The 
inactivation rate of MS2 was shown to be greater than that of ΦX174. However, 
the greatest inactivation was observed for MS2 without the presence of sand, at 
20°C. Sand surfaces offered protection against inactivation especially under 
static conditions. However, no obvious relationship between sand particle size 
and virus inactivation could be established from the experimental data. 
Moreover, the inactivation rates were shown to increase with decreasing virus 
concentration.

To determine the removal efficiency of ultrafiltration (UF) membranes for 
nano-particles in the size range of viruses the state of the art uses challenge 
tests with virus-spiked water. This work focuses on bench-scale and 
semi-technical scale experiments. Different experimental parameters influencing 
the removal efficiency of the tested UF membrane modules were analyzed and 
evaluated for bench- and semi-technical scale experiments. Organic matter in the 
water matrix highly influenced the removal of the tested bacteriophages MS2 and 
phiX174. Less membrane fouling (low ΔTMP) led to a reduced phage reduction. 
Increased flux positively affected phage removal in natural waters. The tested 
bacteriophages MS2 and phiX174 revealed different removal properties. MS2, which 
is widely used as a model organism to determine virus removal efficiencies of 
membranes, mostly showed a better removal than phiX174 for the natural water 
qualities tested. It seems that MS2 is possibly a less conservative surrogate 
for human enteric virus removal than phiX174. In bench-scale experiments log 
removal values (LRV) for MS2 of 2.5-6.0 and of 2.5-4.5 for phiX174 were obtained 
for the examined range of parameters. Phage removal obtained with differently 
fabricated semi-technical modules was quite variable for comparable parameter 
settings, indicating that module fabrication can lead to differing results. 
Potting temperature and module size were identified as influencing factors. In 
conclusion, careful attention has to be paid to the choice of experimental 
settings and module potting when using bench-scale or semi-technical scale 
experiments for UF membrane challenge tests.

Elimination of pathogens and emerging pollutants represents a key factor in 
integrated water resources management in arid regions. Within the SMART Jordan 
Valley project it is the objective of this study to assess the occurrence and 
examine the elimination of selected emerging pollutants and pathogens in waste 
water treatment and aquifer recharge. In batch and soil column studies 
non-chlorinated organophosphorous compounds (tri-n-butylphosphate, 
triphenylphosphate) and endocrine disruptors (e.g. 17-ß-estradiol, bisphenol A) 
proved to be biodegradable, while the X-ray contrast agents iomeprol and 
iopromide were eliminated in the soil columns only, and the chlorinated 
trialkylphosphates showed persistency. Treating waste water in a membrane 
bioreactor (MBR) in combination with powdered activated carbon (PAC) resulted in 
considerable removal rates also for the more persistent compounds such as the 
antiepileptic carbamazepine. Viruses were shown to be present in most of the 
Jordan Valley surface water samples. MBR treatment resulted in a decrease of MS2 
bacteriophages used as model viruses.

AIMS: To develop an anti-microbial filter media using an attached quaternary 
ammonium compound (QAC) and evaluate its performance under conditions relevant 
to household drinking water treatment in developing countries.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Silica sand was coated with dimethyloctadecyl 
[3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl] ammonium chloride via covalent silane chemistry. 
Filter columns packed with coated media were challenged with micro-organisms 
under different water quality conditions. The anti-bacterial properties were 
investigated by visualizing Escherichia coli (E. coli) attachment to coated 
media under fluorescence microscopy combined with a live/dead stain. A 9-cm 
columns with a filtration velocity of 18 m h(-1) achieved log(10) removals of 
1·7 for E. coli, 1·8 for MS2 coliphage, 1·9 for Poliovirus type 3 and 0·36 for 
Adenovirus type 2, compared to 0·1-0·3 log(10) removals of E. coli and MS2 by 
uncoated sand. Removal scaled linearly with column length and decreased with 
increasing ionic strength, flow velocity, filtration time and humic acid 
presence. Escherichia coli attached to QAC-coated sand were observed to be 
membrane-permeable, providing evidence of inactivation.
CONCLUSIONS: Filtration with QAC-coated sand provided higher removal of bacteria 
and viruses than filtration with uncoated sand. However, major limitations 
included rapid fouling by micro-organisms and natural organic matter and low 
removal of viruses PRD1 and Adenovirus 2.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: QAC-coated media may be promising for 
household water treatment. However, more research is needed on long-term 
performance, options to reduce fouling and inactivation mechanisms.

Enteric viruses, particularly human Noroviruses (NoV) and hepatitis A virus 
(HAV), are key food-borne pathogens. The attachment of these pathogens to 
foodstuff and food-contact surfaces is an important mechanism in the human 
contamination process. Studies were done to investigate the nature of the 
physicochemical forces, such as hydrophobic and electrostatic ones, involved in 
the interaction virus/matrix but, at this day, only few data are available 
concerning surface properties of viruses and prediction of the adhesion capacity 
of one specific virus onto matrices is still very difficult. The purpose of this 
study was to propose a reference system, including a representative virus 
surrogate, able to predict as close as possible behaviour of pathogenic viruses 
in term of adhesion on inert (stainless steel and polypropylene) and food 
surfaces (lettuce leaves, strawberries and raspberries). The adhesion of human 
pathogenic enteric viruses, cultivable strain of HAV and non-cultivable strains 
of human NoV (genogroups I and II), have been quantified and compared to these 
of human enteric viruses surrogates, included the MNV-1 and three F-specific RNA 
bacteriophages (MS2, GA and Qβ). A standardized approach was developed to assess 
and quantify viral adhesion on tested matrices after a contact time with each 
virus using real-time RT-PCR. Methods used for virus recovery were in accordance 
with the CEN recommendations, including a bovine Enterovirus type 1 as control 
to monitor the efficiency of the extraction process and amplification procedure 
from directly extracted or eluted samples. The adhesion of human pathogenic 
viruses, ranging from 0.1 to 2%, could be comparable for all matrices studied, 
except for NoV GII on soft fruits. Adhesion percentages obtained for the studied 
surrogate virus and phages were shown to be comparable to those of HAV and NoV 
on inert and lettuce surfaces. The MNV-1 appeared as the best candidate to 
simulate adhesion phenomena of all human pathogenic enteric viruses on all 
studied surfaces, while MS2 and GA bacteriophages could be a good alternative as 
model of viral adhesion on inert and lettuce surfaces. These results will be 
usable to design relevant experimental systems integrating adhesion behaviour of 
enteric viruses in the assessment of the efficiency of a technological or 
hygienic industrial process.

Knoxville, TN 37996, USA.

Chitosan is known to have bactericidal and antifungal activity. Although human 
noroviruses are the leading cause of non-bacterial gastroenteritis, information 
on the efficacy of chitosan against foodborne viruses is very limited. The 
objective of this work was to determine the effectiveness of different molecular 
weight chitosans against the cultivable human norovirus and enteric virus 
surrogates, feline calicivirus, FCV-F9, murine norovirus, MNV-1, and 
bacteriophages, MS2 and phiX174. Five purified chitosans (53, 222, 307, 421, 
~1150 kDa) were dissolved in water, 1% acetic acid, or aqueous HCl pH = 4.3, 
sterilized by membrane filtration, and mixed with equal volume of virus to 
obtain a final concentration of 0.7% chitosan and 5 log(10) PFU/ml virus. 
Virus-chitosan suspensions were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. Untreated viruses in 
PBS, in PBS with acetic acid, and in PBS with HCl were tested as controls. Each 
experiment was run in duplicate and replicated at least twice. Water-soluble 
chitosan (53 kDa) reduced phiX174, MS2, FCV-F9 and MNV-1 titers by 0.59, 2.44, 
3.36, and 0.34 log(10) PFU/ml respectively. Chitosans in acetic acid decreased 
phiX174 by 1.19-1.29, MS2 by 1.88-5.37, FCV-F9 by 2.27-2.94, and MNV-1 by 
0.09-0.28 log(10) PFU/ml, respectively. Increasing the MW of chitosan 
corresponded with an increasing antiviral effect on MS2, but did not appear to 
play a role for the other three tested viral surrogates. Overall, chitosan 
treatments showed the greatest reduction for FCV-F9, and MS2 followed by 
phiX174, and with no significant effect on MNV-1.

Alumoxane/ferroxane nanoparticles for the removal of viral pathogens: the 
importance of surface functionality to nanoparticle activity.

University, Houston, Texas 77005, USA.

A bi-functional nano-composite coating has been created on a porous Nomex® 
fabric support as a trap for aspirated virus contaminated water. Nomex® fabric 
was successively dip-coated in solutions containing cysteic acid functionalized 
alumina (alumoxane) nanoparticles and cysteic acid functionalized iron oxide 
(ferroxane) nanoparticles to form a nanoparticle coated Nomex® (NPN) fabric. 
From SEM and EDX the nanoparticle coating of the Nomex® fibers is uniform, 
continuous, and conformal. The NPN was used as a filter for aspirated 
bacteriophage MS2 viruses using end-on filtration. All measurements were 
repeated to give statistical reliability. The NPN fabrics show a large decrease 
as compared to Nomex® alone or alumoxane coated Nomex®. An increase in the 
ferroxane content results in an equivalent increase in virus retention. This 
suggests that it is the ferroxane that has an active role in deactivating and/or 
binding the virus. Heating the NPN to 160 °C results in the loss of cysteic acid 
functional groups (without loss of the iron nanoparticle's core structure) and 
the resulting fabric behaves similar to that of untreated Nomex®, showing that 
the surface functionalization of the nanoparticles is vital for the surface 
collapse of aspirated water droplets and the absorption and immobilization of 
the MS2 viruses. Thus, for virus immobilization, it is not sufficient to have 
iron oxide nanoparticles per se, but the surface functionality of a nanoparticle 
is vitally important in ensuring efficacy.

Bacteriophage removal by Ni/Al layered double hydroxide in batch and 
flow-through column experiments.

Seoul, Korea.

The objective of this study was to investigate the removal of the bacteriophage 
MS2 by Ni/Al layered double hydroxide (LDH). Batch experiments were performed 
using a powder form of Ni/Al LDH under various conditions. Column experiments 
were also performed under flow-through conditions with Ni/Al LDH coated sand. 
Batch tests showed that the powder form of Ni/Al LDH was effective for 
bacteriophage removal under the given experimental conditions (LDH dose of 2.5 g 
L(-1); initial MS2 concentration of 1.35 × 10(5) plaque forming unit (pfu) 
mL(-1)) with a removal capacity of 5.5 × 10(7) pfu g(-1). The results also 
indicated that the effect of the solution pH on the bacteriophage removal was 
minimal at pH 4.3-9.4. The influence of divalent anions (SO(2-) (4), CO(2-) (3), 
HPO(2-) (4); concentrations 1-100 mM) on the removal of the bacteriophage was 
significant, while the effects of monovalent anions (NO(-) (3), Cl(-)) were 
negligible. Column experiments showed that the log removal of MS2 was 4.51 in 
columns containing 100% Ni/Al LDH-coated sand, while it was 0.02 in columns 
containing 100% quartz sand (initial MS2 concentration of approximately 7.0 × 
10(5) pfu mL(-1); flow rate of 0.5 mL min(-1)). These findings indicated that 
Ni/Al LDH-coated sand was far more effective at removing bacteriophage than sand 
alone. This study demonstrates that Ni/Al LDH can be used for virus removal in 
water treatment and filtration applications.

Novel methods to effectively disinfect contact surfaces and prevent human 
norovirus transmission are essential. The effect of benzalkonium chloride (BAC), 
potassium peroxymonosulfate (KPMS), tannic acid (TA), and gallic acid (GA) on 
enteric virus surrogates, murine norovirus (MNV-1), feline calicivirus (FCV-F9), 
and bacteriophage MS2 was studied. Viruses at high (∼7 log₁₀ PFU/mL) or low (∼5 
log₁₀ PFU/mL) titers were mixed with equal volumes of BAC (0.2, 0.5, and 
1 mg/mL), KPMS (5, 10, and 20 mg/mL), TA (0.02 and 0.2 mg/mL), GA (0.2, 0.4, and 
0.8 mg/mL), or water and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Viral 
infectivity after triplicate treatments was evaluated using plaque assays in 
duplicate. Low titers of FCV-F9 and MNV-1 were completely reduced, while 
low-titer MS2 was reduced by 1.7-1.8 log₁₀ PFU/mL with BAC at all three 
concentrations. High-titer FCV-F9 was reduced by 2.87, 3.08, and 3.25 log₁₀ 
PFU/mL, and high-titer MNV-1 was reduced by 1.55, 2.32, and 2.75 log₁₀ PFU/mL 
with BAC at 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/mL, respectively. High-titer MS2 was reduced 
by ∼2 log₁₀ PFU/mL with BAC at all three concentrations. KPMS at all three 
concentrations reduced high and low titers of FCV-F9 and MS2 and low-titer MNV-1 
to undetectable levels, while high-titer MNV-1 was reduced by 0.92 and 3.44 
log₁₀ PFU/mL with KMPS at 2.5 and 5 mg/mL, respectively. TA at 0.2 mg/mL only 
reduced high-titer FCV-F9 by 0.98 log₁₀ PFU/mL and low-titer FCV-F9 by 1.95 
log₁₀ PFU/mL. GA at 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mg/mL reduced low-titer FCV-F9 by 2.50, 
2.36, and 0.86 log₁₀ PFU/mL, respectively with negligible effects against 
high-titer FCV-F9. BAC and KPMS show promise to be used as broad-spectrum 
contact surface disinfectants for prevention of noroviral surrogate 
contamination.

MS2 phage (MS2 Ø) is a coli phage, non-pathogenic to eukaryotic cells, which has 
been used as a simulant for viral biothreats, such as those causing smallpox and 
hemorrhagic fever. MS2 Ø consists of an icosahedral capsid, 28nm in diameter, 
and a single stranded RNA genome; the viral capsid is composed of 180 copies of 
coat protein (CP). In this study, we isolated anti-MS2 Ø single domain 
antibodies (sdAbs) for the sensitive detection of the MS2 Ø. To achieve this, a 
first immune sdAb library was prepared from llamas immunized with purified coat 
protein and a second from animals immunized with MS2 Ø. By panning the two 
libraries against CP, MS2 Ø, or alternating between the two targets, anti-MS2 Ø 
and anti-CP sdAbs were selected, sequenced, and characterized for their binding 
affinity. Both direct binding assays and capture sandwich assays were performed 
on the MAGPIX platform. One of the best anti-MS2 Ø sdAb, Lib2CP12H, could detect 
MS2 Ø concentrations as low as 1.45ng/mL (∼5.0E+6pfu/mL), providing equivalent 
detection to conventional antibodies. This sdAb is thermally stable with a 
melting temperature around 60°C and recovered 80% of its secondary structure 
after heat denaturation.

Inactivation and tailing during UV254 disinfection of viruses: contributions of 
viral aggregation, light shielding within viral aggregates, and recombination.

Environmental Engineering (ENAC), École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne 
(EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland.

UV disinfection of viruses frequently leads to tailing after an initial 
exponential decay. Aggregation, light shielding, recombination, or resistant 
virus subpopulations have been proposed as explanations; however, none of these 
options has been conclusively demonstrated. This study investigates how 
aggregation affects virus inactivation by UV(254) in general, and the tailing 
phenomenon in particular. Bacteriophage MS2 was aggregated by lowering the 
solution pH before UV(254) disinfection. Aggregates were redispersed prior to 
enumeration to obtain the remaining fraction of individual infectious viruses. 
Results showed that initial inactivation kinetics were similar for viruses 
incorporated in aggregates (up to 1000 nm in radius) and dispersed viruses; 
however, aggregated viruses started to tail more readily than dispersed ones. 
Neither light shielding, nor the presence of resistant subpopulations could 
account for the tailing. Instead, tailing was consistent with recombination 
arising from the simultaneous infection of the host by several impaired viruses. 
We argue that UV(254) treatment of aggregates permanently fused a fraction of 
viruses, which increased the likelihood of multiple infection of a host cell and 
ultimately enabled the production of infective viruses via recombination.

We present a rapid and effective adsorption-elution method based on monolithic 
affinity filtration (MAF) for the concentration and purification of waterborne 
viruses. The MAF column consists of a hydrolyzed macroporous epoxy-based 
polymer. High recoveries were achieved by columns for the bacterial virus 
(bacteriophage) MS2 110 (±19)%, as model organism, as well as for human 
adenoviruses 42.4 (±3.4)% and murine noroviruses 42.6 (±1.9)%. This new 
concentration and purification method was combined with crossflow 
ultrafiltration (CUF). Because of the adsorption of the examined viruses to the 
macroporous surface of the MAF column at pH 3, concentrated matrix components by 
CUF can be removed. Bacteriophages MS2 were spiked in tap water and concentrated 
with the new CUF-MAF concentration method by a volumetric factor of 10(4) within 
33 min. Furthermore, the detection limit for quantification of bacteriophage MS2 
by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) could be improved from 79.47 
to 0.0056 GU mL(-1) by a factor of 1.4 × 10(4). In a first study, we have shown 
that this method could also be applied for river water containing naturally MS2 
and MS2-like phages.

Testing linen disinfection procedures in practice with 
phage-charged-bioindicators.

(1)Hohenstein Institute, Institute for Hygiene and Biotechnology, Boennigheim, 
Germany.

PURPOSE: Disinfecting laundry processes are essential to avoid contamination of 
laundering machines and linen during commercial laundry reprocessing in the 
health care sector. Recently a bacteriophage-charged bioindicator has been 
developed using MS2 as surrogate virus for testing of low-temperature 
disinfecting laundry processing on efficacy against viruses related to practice. 
This paper therefore aims to investigate application of MS2-bioindicators in 
chemothermal processes under practical conditions (phase 2/step 2) and in 
practice (phase 3).
DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The experimental design was developed and modified 
according to the German Society for Hygiene and Microbiology (DGHM) Standard 
Methods for Testing Chemical Disinfection Processes. Tests under practical 
conditions were performed at 60 degrees C and 70 degrees C. Additional tests in 
tunnel washers were carried out at 60 degrees C and 70 degrees C. In all 
experiments validated disinfecting laundry processes, recommended for 
bactericidal and virucidal performance (categories A and B), were applied.
FINDINGS: The results show a temperature-dependent gradual efficacy against the 
test virus MS2 up to reduction values of more than 8 log10-steps. Therefore 
MS2-bioindicators prove to be suitable as a tool to determine the performance of 
disinfection procedures against viruses in practice.
ORIGINALITY/VALUE: Phage-charged bioindicators may be a tool to provide further 
insights into the reliability of antiviral laundry processes for health care 
quality management and for infection control.

targeted airborne microorganisms.

Bioaerosols could cause various severe human and animal diseases and their 
opportune and qualitative precise detection and control is becoming a 
significant scientific and technological topic for consideration. Over the last 
few decades bioaerosol detection has become an important bio-defense related 
issue. Many types of portable and stationary bioaerosol samplers have been 
developed and, in some cases, integrated into automated detection systems 
utilizing various microbiological techniques for analysis of collected microbes. 
This paper describes a personal sampler used in conjunction with a portable 
real-time PCR technique. It was found that a single fluorescent dye could be 
successfully used in multiplex format for qualitative detection of numerous 
targeted bioaerosols in one PCR tube making the suggested technology a reliable 
"first alert" device. This approach has been specifically developed and 
successfully verified for rapid detection of targeted microorganisms by portable 
PCR devices, which is especially important under field conditions, where the 
number of microorganisms of interest usually exceeds the number of available PCR 
reaction tubes. The approach allows detecting targeted microorganisms and 
triggering some corresponding sanitary and quarantine procedures to localize 
possible spread of dangerous infections. Following detailed analysis of the 
sample under controlled laboratory conditions could be used to exactly identify 
which particular microorganism out of a targeted group has been rapidly detected 
in the field. It was also found that the personal sampler has a collection 
efficiency higher than 90% even for small-sized viruses (>20 nm) and stable 
performance over extended operating periods. In addition, it was found that for 
microorganisms used in this project (bacteriophages MS2 and T4) elimination of 
nucleic acids isolation and purification steps during sample preparation does 
not lead to the system sensitivity reduction, which is extremely important for 
development of miniature bioaerosol monitoring instrumentation in the future.

Osmolyte-mediated encapsulation of proteins inside MS2 viral capsids.

94720, USA.

The encapsulation of enzymes in nanometer-sized compartments has the potential 
to enhance and control enzymatic activity, both in vivo and in vitro. Despite 
this potential, there is little quantitative data on the effect of encapsulation 
in a well-defined compartment under varying conditions. To gain more insight 
into these effects, we have characterized two improved methods for the 
encapsulation of heterologous molecules inside bacteriophage MS2 viral capsids. 
First, attaching DNA oligomers to a molecule of interest and incubating it with 
MS2 coat protein dimers yielded reassembled capsids that packaged the tagged 
molecules. The addition of a protein-stabilizing osmolyte, 
trimethylamine-N-oxide, significantly increased the yields of reassembly. 
Second, we found that expressed proteins with genetically encoded negatively 
charged peptide tags could also induce capsid reassembly, resulting in high 
yields of reassembled capsids containing the protein. This second method was 
used to encapsulate alkaline phosphatase tagged with a 16 amino acid peptide. 
The purified encapsulated enzyme was found to have the same K(m) value and a 
slightly lower k(cat) value than the free enzyme, indicating that this method of 
encapsulation had a minimal effect on enzyme kinetics. This method provides a 
practical and potentially scalable way of studying the complex effects of

Accumulation of enteric viruses on surfaces within a drinking water distribution 
system was investigated in a reactor using three F-specific RNA bacteriophages 
(MS2, GA, and Qβ) as models of human pathogenic viruses. The influence of 
hydrodynamic versus hydrostatic conditions and the effect of the colonization of 
HDPE surfaces with two-month-old biofilms were assessed for virus accumulation 
on surfaces. In order to work under controlled laminar conditions and to study 
various wall shear stresses at the same time, a new rotating disc reactor was 
designed. Among the wall shear rates applied in the reactor (450 to 1640 s(-1)) 
no significant differences were observed concerning both the total number of 
bacteria, which was found to be around 1.7 × 10(7) cells/cm(2) and the virus 
concentrations on surfaces were about 3 × 10(4), 5 × 10(5) and 3 × 10(5) eq 
PFU/cm(2) for MS2, GA and Qβ phages, respectively. Comparison between static 
versus dynamic conditions revealed that both Brownian diffusion and convective 
diffusion were involved in the transport of these soft colloidal particles and 
an increase reaching about 1 log in virus concentrations measured on surfaces 
appeared when hydrodynamic conditions where applied. Our results also showed the 
influence of the colonization by two-month-old drinking water biofilms which led 
to a change in the level of virus adhesion. The implication of the 
physico-chemical properties was also underlined since different adhesion 
profiles were obtained for the three bacteriophages and MS2 phage was found to 
be the less adherent one whatever the conditions applied.

Protein profiling is an increasingly valuable tool for the characterization of 
protein populations and has been used to identify microorganisms, most often 
using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry. We 
present a rapid method for the identification of viruses using microfluidic chip 
gel electrophoresis (CGE) of high-copy number proteins to generate unique 
protein profiles. Viral proteins are solubilized, fluorescently labeled and then 
analyzed using the μChemLab™ CGE system (∼10 min overall). A Bayesian 
classification approach is used to classify the reproducible and visually 
distinct protein profiles of MS2 bacteriophage, Epstein-Barr, Respiratory 
Syncytial, and Vaccinia viruses as well as discriminate between closely related 
T2 and T4 bacteriophage.

Evidence that viral RNAs have evolved for efficient, two-stage packaging.

Sciences, University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom.

Genome packaging is an essential step in virus replication and a potential drug 
target. Single-stranded RNA viruses have been thought to encapsidate their 
genomes by gradual co-assembly with capsid subunits. In contrast, using a single 
molecule fluorescence assay to monitor RNA conformation and virus assembly in 
real time, with two viruses from differing structural families, we have 
discovered that packaging is a two-stage process. Initially, the genomic RNAs 
undergo rapid and dramatic (approximately 20-30%) collapse of their solution 
conformations upon addition of cognate coat proteins. The collapse occurs with a 
substoichiometric ratio of coat protein subunits and is followed by a gradual 
increase in particle size, consistent with the recruitment of additional 
subunits to complete a growing capsid. Equivalently sized nonviral RNAs, 
including high copy potential in vivo competitor mRNAs, do not collapse. They do 
support particle assembly, however, but yield many aberrant structures in 
contrast to viral RNAs that make only capsids of the correct size. The collapse 
is specific to viral RNA fragments, implying that it depends on a series of 
specific RNA-protein interactions. For bacteriophage MS2, we have shown that 
collapse is driven by subsequent protein-protein interactions, consistent with 
the RNA-protein contacts occurring in defined spatial locations. Conformational 
collapse appears to be a distinct feature of viral RNA that has evolved to 
facilitate assembly. Aspects of this process mimic those seen in ribosome 
assembly.

Ferrate [Fe(VI); FeO(4)(2-)] is an emerging oxidizing agent capable of 
controlling chemical and microbial water contaminants. Here, inactivation of MS2 
coliphage by Fe(VI) was examined. The inactivation kinetics observed in 
individual batch experiments was well described by a Chick-Watson model with 
first-order dependences on disinfectant and infective phage concentrations. The 
inactivation rate constant k(i) at a Fe(VI) dose of 1.23 mgFe/L (pH 7.0, 25 °C) 
was 2.27(±0.05) L/(mgFe × min), corresponding to 99.99% inactivation at a Ct of 
~4 (mgFe × min)/L. Measured k(i) values were found to increase with increasing 
applied Fe(VI) dose (0.56-2.24 mgFe/L), increasing temperature (5-30 °C), and 
decreasing pH conditions (pH 6-11). The Fe(VI) dose effect suggested that an 
unidentified Fe byproduct also contributed to inactivation. Temperature 
dependence was characterized by an activation energy of 39(±6) kJ mol(-1), and 
k(i) increased >50-fold when pH decreased from 11 to 6. The pH effect was 
quantitatively described by parallel reactions with HFeO(4)(-) and FeO(4)(2-). 
Mass spectrometry and qRT-PCR analyses demonstrated that both capsid protein and 
genome damage increased with the extent of inactivation, suggesting that both 
may contribute to phage inactivation. Capsid protein damage, localized in the 
two regions containing oxidant-sensitive cysteine residues, and protein cleavage 
in one of the two regions may facilitate genome damage by increasing Fe(VI) 
access to the interior of the virion.

Mineral pot filters (MPFs) are household water treatment (HWT) devices that are 
manufactured and distributed by the private sector, with millions of users in 
Southeast Asia. Their effectiveness in reducing waterborne microbes has not been 
previously investigated. We purchased three types of MPFs available on the 
Cambodian market for systematic evaluation of bacteria, virus, and protozoan 
surrogate microbial reduction in laboratory challenge experiments following WHO 
recommended performance testing protocols. Results over the total 1500 L testing 
period per filter indicate that the devices tested were highly effective in 
reducing Esherichia coli (99.99%+), moderately effective in reducing 
bacteriophage MS2 (99%+), and somewhat effective against Bacillus atrophaeus, a 
spore-forming bacterium we used as a surrogate for protozoa (88%+). Treatment 
mechanisms for all filters included porous ceramic and activated carbon 
filtration. Our results suggest that these commercially available filters may be 
at least as effective against waterborne pathogens as other, locally available 
treatment options such as ceramic pot filters or boiling. More research is 
needed on the role these devices may play as interim solutions to the problem of 
unsafe drinking water in Cambodia and globally.

The performance of ozonation in wastewater depends on water quality and the 
ability to form hydroxyl radicals (·OH) to meet disinfection or contaminant 
transformation objectives. Since there are no on-line methods to assess ozone 
and ·OH exposure in wastewater, many agencies are now embracing indicator 
frameworks and surrogate monitoring for regulatory compliance. Two of the most 
promising surrogate parameters for ozone-based treatment of secondary and 
tertiary wastewater effluents are differential UV(254) absorbance (ΔUV(254)) and 
total fluorescence (ΔTF). In the current study, empirical correlations for 
ΔUV(254) and ΔTF were developed for the oxidation of 18 trace organic 
contaminants (TOrCs), including 1,4-dioxane, atenolol, atrazine, bisphenol A, 
carbamazepine, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, meprobamate, naproxen, 
N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), para-chlorobenzoic acid (pCBA), phenytoin, 
primidone, sulfamethoxazole, triclosan, trimethoprim, and 
tris-(2-chloroethyl)-phosphate (TCEP) (R(2) = 0.50-0.83) and the inactivation of 
three microbial surrogates, including Escherichia coli, MS2, and Bacillus 
subtilis spores (R(2) = 0.46-0.78). Nine wastewaters were tested in laboratory 
systems, and eight wastewaters were evaluated at pilot- and full-scale. A 
predictive model for OH exposure based on ΔUV(254) or ΔTF was also proposed.

[Construction and expression of virus-like particles containing rotavirus NSP3 
gene].

OBJECTIVE: To construct and express ribonuclease-resistant virus-like particles 
containing rotavirus NSP3 gene by changing the affinity of MS2 bacteriophage 
coat protein pac site and to discuss the stability.
METHODS: In the study, 1 049 bp rotavirus NSP3 gene fragments were amplified by 
PCR using the primers containing PvuI and KpnI restriction enzyme sites and the 
uridine at position -5 in the pac site was replaced with cytosine to increase 
the affinity. The gel-purified PCR-amplified DNA fragments and pACYC-MS2 vector 
were digested with PvuI and KpnI and then ligated to generate recombinant 
plasmid pACYC-MS2-NSP3. The expression vector was transformed into competent 
Escherichia coli strain TOP 10, and was verified by PCR and sequencing. The 
positive bacteria were transformed into competent E.coli strain BL21(DE3). Then 
the cells were lysed by ultrasonic disruption, virus like particles (VLPs) were 
harvested after purification and their stability was discussed.
RESULTS: The expression plasmid containing mutant pac site (uridine at position 
-5 in the pac site replaced with cytosine) was constructed successfully and the 
ribonuclease-resistant virus-like particles containing rotavirus NSP3 gene were 
expressed successfully. The VLPs were resistant to ribonuclease and 
deoxyribonuclease, and were stable at -20 °C, 4 °C and room temperature(25 °C), 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: The methods used to increase the affinity of pac site could 
successfully construct and express the VLPs. The VLPs containing rotavirus NSP3 
gene are stable and could be used as surrogates for positive controls and 
standards in rotavirus real time fluorescent quantitative reverse 
transcription-PCR kits.

Oxidative processes are often harnessed as tools for pathogen disinfection. 
Although the pathways responsible for bacterial inactivation with various 
biocides are fairly well understood, virus inactivation mechanisms are often 
contradictory or equivocal. In this study, we provide a quantitative analysis of 
the total damage incurred by a model virus (bacteriophage MS2) upon inactivation 
induced by five common virucidal agents (heat, UV, hypochlorous acid, singlet 
oxygen, and chlorine dioxide). Each treatment targets one or more virus 
functions to achieve inactivation: UV, singlet oxygen, and hypochlorous acid 
treatments generally render the genome nonreplicable, whereas chlorine dioxide 
and heat inhibit host-cell recognition/binding. Using a combination of 
quantitative analytical tools, we identified unique patterns of molecular level 
modifications in the virus proteins or genome that lead to the inhibition of 
these functions and eventually inactivation. UV and chlorine treatments, for 
example, cause site-specific capsid protein backbone cleavage that inhibits 
viral genome injection into the host cell. Combined, these results will aid in 
developing better methods for combating waterborne and foodborne viral pathogens 
and further our understanding of the adaptive changes viruses undergo in 
response to natural and anthropogenic stressors.

Survival of murine norovirus and F-RNA coliphage MS2 on pork during storage and 
retail display.

The existence of animal strains of norovirus (NV) that are closely related to 
human strains raises concerns about interspecies recombination and the potential 
for zoonotic transmission through undercooked meat products. Contamination of 
meat with NV can occur both via meat processing operations and poor food handler 
hygiene. There is a lack of knowledge on the survival of NV on raw meat because 
NV cannot be effectively cultivated and its detection is limited to molecular 
methods. The survival of murine norovirus (MNV) and MS2, as surrogates for NV, 
was determined on pork chops by plaque assay and real time RT-PCR. Both MNV and 
MS2 displayed very high survival rates on vacuum packaged raw pork chops that 
were stored at 2°C for up to 7 weeks and numbers declined little during 
subsequent retail display for 7 days. Maximum reductions for MNV and MS2 were 
1.0 log PFU/cm(2) and 0.6 log genome copies(GC)/cm(2) or 1.1 log PFU/cm(2) and 
1.2 log GC/cm(2), respectively. The viability of MS2 and MNV was not affected by 
the proteolytic enzymes present in the meat nor by numbers of bacteria that 
increased with time during storage in vacuum packs and while on retail display. 
MNV and MS2 can be considered as good surrogates for NV on raw meat. The 
findings of this study indicate that potentially pathogenic NV will likely 
survive extremely well on fresh meat and consumers could potentially be at risk 
when consuming undercooked meat that is contaminated with NV.

MS2 viruslike particles: a robust, semisynthetic targeted drug delivery 
platform.

LS2 9JT, UK.

We show that viruslike particles (VLPs) reassembled in vitro with the RNA 
bacteriophage MS2 coat protein and an RNA conjugate encompassing a siRNA and a 
known capsid assembly signal can be targeted to HeLa cells by covalent 
attachment of human transferrin. The siRNA VLPs protect their cargoes from 
nuclease, have a double-stranded conformation in the capsid and carry multiple 
drug and targeting ligands. The relative efficiency of VLP reassembly has been 
assessed, and conditions have been determined for larger scale production. 
Targeted VLPs have been purified away from unmodified VLPs for the first time 
allowing improved analysis of the effects of this synthetic virion system. The 
particles enter cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis and produce siRNA 
effects at low nanomolar concentrations. Although less effective than a 
commercial cationic lipid vector at siRNA delivery, the smaller amounts of 
internalized RNA with VLP delivery had an effect as good as if not better than 
the lipid transfection route. This implies that the siRNAs delivered by this 
route are more accessible to the siRNA pathway than identical RNAs delivered in 
complex lipid aggregates. The data suggest that the MS2 system continues to show 
many of the features that will be required to create an effective targeted drug 
delivery system. The fluorescence assays of siRNA effects described here will 
facilitate the combinatorial analysis of both future formulations and dosing 
regimes.

high-pressure homogenization.

Human noroviruses (HNoV) have been implicated in gastrointestinal outbreaks 
associated with fresh produce, juices, and ready-to-eat foods. In order to 
determine the risk of HNoV transmission by contaminated blueberry juice, 
survival characteristics of cultivable HNoV surrogates (murine norovirus, MNV-1; 
feline calicivirus, FCV-F9; and bacteriophage MS2) in blueberry juice (pH = 
2.77) after 0, 1, 2, 7, 14, and 21 days at refrigeration temperatures (4°C) were 
studied. High-pressure homogenization (HPH) was studied as a novel processing 
method for noroviral surrogate inactivation in blueberry juice. Blueberry juice 
or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2 as control) was inoculated with each 
virus, stored over 21 days at 4°C or subjected to HPH, and plaque assayed. 
FCV-F9 (∼5 log(10) PFU/mL) was undetectable after 1 day in blueberry juice at 
4°C. MNV-1 (∼4 log(10) PFU/ml) showed minimal reduction (1 log(10) PFU/mL) after 
14 days, with greater reduction (1.95 log(10) PFU/mL; p < 0.05) after 21 days in 
blueberry juice at 4°C. Bacteriophage MS2 (∼6 log(10) PFU/mL) showed significant 
reduction (1.93 log(10) PFU/mL; p < 0.05) after 2 days and was undetectable 
after 7 days in blueberry juice at 4°C. FCV-F9 remained viable in PBS for up to 
21 days (2.28 log(10) PFU/mL reduction), while MNV-1 and MS2 survived after 21 
days (1.08 and 0.56 log(10) PFU/mL reduction, respectively). Intriguingly, 
FCV-F9 and bacteriophage MS2 showed reduction after minimal homogenization 
pressures in blueberry juice (pH = 2.77), possibly due to the combination of 
juice pH, juice components, and mechanical effects. MNV-1 in blueberry juice was 
only slightly reduced at 250 (0.33 log(10) PFU/mL) and 300 MPa (0.71 log(10) 
PFU/mL). Virus surrogate survival in blueberry juice at 4°C correlates well with 
the ease of HNoV transmission via juices. HPH for viral inactivation in juices 
is dependent on virus type, and higher homogenization pressures may be needed 
for MNV-1 inactivation.

Recently RNA localization has been appreciated as an essential 
post-transcriptional mechanism to program local proteome composition and 
function. Although RNA has been visualized using diverse techniques, the use of 
the bacteriophage MS2 method to encode genetically fluorescent RNA has 
revolutionized the study of RNA dynamics in living cells. Here, I highlight the 
strength of MS2 compared to other techniques, and how further evolution of this 
system will enable the visualization of RNA in the context of complex live-cell 
dynamics. Although the generation of MS2-fluorescence resonance energy transfer 
(FRET) and MS2-bifluorescence complementation (BiFC) will require further 
development, it has the potential to increase significantly the signal-to-noise 
ratio, which is the major obstacle to rapid live-cell imaging of RNA.

Modeling bacteriophage amplification as a predictive tool for optimized 
MALDI-TOF MS-based bacterial detection.

CO 80401, USA.

Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry 
(MALDI-TOF MS) is a valuable tool for rapid bacterial detection and 
identification but is limited by the need for relatively high cell count 
samples, which have been grown under strictly controlled conditions. These 
requirements can be eliminated by the natural infection of a viable bacterial 
species of interest with a host-specific phage. This produces a rapid increase 
in phage protein concentrations in comparison to bacterial concentrations, which 
can in turn be exploited as a method for signal amplification during MALDI-TOF 
MS. One drawback to this approach is the requirement for repetitive, 
time-consuming sample preparation and analysis applied over the course of a 
phage infection to monitor phage concentrations as a function of time to 
determine the MALDI-TOF MS detection limit. To reduce the requirement for 
repeated preparation and analysis, a modified phage therapy model was 
investigated as a means for predicting the time during a given phage infection 
when a detectable signal would occur. The modified model used a series of three 
differential equations composed of predetermined experimental parameters 
including phage burst size and burst time to predict progeny phage 
concentrations as a function of time. Using Yersinia pestis with plague 
diagnostic phage φA1122 and Escherichia coli with phage MS2 as two separate, 
well-characterized model phage-host pairs, we conducted in silico modeling of 
the infection process and compared it with experimental infections monitored in 
real time by MALDI-TOF MS. Significant agreement between mathematically 
calculated phage growth curves and those experimentally obtained by MALDI-TOF MS 
was observed, thus verifying this method's utility for significant time and 
labor reduction.

Visualizing and quantifying dose distribution in a UV reactor using 
three-dimensional laser-induced fluorescence.

Technology , 200 Bobby Dodd Way, Atlanta, Georgia 30332-0373, USA.

Evaluating the performance of typical water treatment UV reactors is challenging 
due to the complexity in assessing spatial and temporal variation of UV fluence, 
resulting from highly unsteady, turbulent nature of flow and variation in UV 
intensity. In this study, three-dimensional laser-induced fluorescence (3DLIF) 
was applied to visualize and quantitatively analyze a lab-scale UV reactor 
consisting of one lamp sleeve placed perpendicular to flow. Mapping the spatial 
and temporal fluence delivery and MS2 inactivation revealed the highest local 
fluence in the wake zone due to longer residence time and higher UV exposure, 
while the lowest local fluence occurred in a region near the walls due to 
short-circuiting flow and lower UV fluence rate. Comparing the tracer based 
decomposition between hydrodynamics and IT revealed similar coherent structures 
showing the dependency of fluence delivery on the reactor flow. The location of 
tracer injection, varying the height and upstream distance from the lamp center, 
was found to significantly affect the UV fluence received by the tracer. A 
Lagrangian-based analysis was also employed to predict the fluence along 
specific paths of travel, which agreed with the experiments. The 3DLIF technique 
developed in this study provides new insight on dose delivery that fluctuates 
both spatially and temporally and is expected to aid design and optimization of 
UV reactors as well as validate computational fluid dynamics models that are 
widely used to simulate UV reactor performances.

The response of a representative virus and indicator bacteria to heating, solar 
irradiation, or their combination, was investigated in a controlled solar 
simulator and under real sun conditions. Heating showed higher inactivation of 
Escherichia coli compared to the bacteriophage MS2. Heating combined with 
natural or simulated solar irradiation demonstrated a synergistic effect on the 
inactivation of E. coli, with up to 3-log difference for 50 °C and natural sun 
insolation of 2,000 kJ m(-2) (compared to the sum of the separate treatments). 
Similar synergistic effect was also evident when solar-UV induced DNA damage to 
E. coli was assessed using the endonuclease sensitive site assay (ESS). MS2 was 
found to be highly resistant to irradiation and heat, with a slightly 
synergistic effect observed only at 59 °C and natural sun insolation of 5,580 kJ 
m(-2). Heat treatment also hindered light-dependent recovery of E. coli making 
the treatment much more effective.

Waste disposal on land and the consequent transport of bacterial and viral 
pathogens in soils and aquifers are of major concern worldwide. Pathogen 
transport can be enhanced in the presence of organic matter due to occupation of 
attachment sites in the aquifer materials thus preventing pathogen attachment 
leading to their faster transport for longer distances. Laboratory column 
studies were carried out to investigate the effect of organic matter, in the 
form of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), on the transport of Escherichia coli and 
MS2 phage in saturated clean silica sand. Transport rates of these microbial 
tracers were also studied in a contaminated field site. Laboratory column 
studies showed that low concentrations (0.17 mg L(-1)) of DOC had little effect 
on E. coli J6-2 removal and slightly reduced the attachment of MS2 phage. After 
progressive conditioning of the column with DOC (1.7 mg L(-1) and 17 mg L(-1)), 
neither E. coli J6-2 nor MS2 phage showed any attachment and recovery rates 
increased dramatically (up to 100%). The results suggest that DOC can affect the 
transport rates of microbial contaminants. For E. coli J6-2 the predominant 
effect appeared to be an increase in the secondary energy minimum leading to an 
increase in E. coli attachment initially. However, after 17 mg L(-1) DOC 
conditioning of the silica sand no attachment of E. coli was observed as the DOC 
took up attachment sites in the porous media. MS2 phage appeared to be affected 
predominantly by out-competition of binding sites in the clean silica sand and a 
steady reduction in attachment was observed as the DOC conditioning increased. 
Field study showed a high removal of both E. coli and MS2 phage, although E. 
coli was removed at a lower rate than MS2 phage. In the field it is likely that 
a combination of effects are seen as the aquifer material will be heterogeneous 
in its surface nanoscale properties, demonstrated by the differing removal of E. 
coli and MS2 phage compared to the laboratory scale experiments. This research 
demonstrates the importance of combining laboratory scale and field scale 
studies to fully understand removal of microbes in groundwater aquifers affected 
by organic matter (DOC).

BACKGROUND: Virus-like Particles (VLPs) display can be used to increase the 
immunogenicity of heterologous antigens. Here, we report the use of a 
bacteriophage MS2-based VLP display platform to develop a monovalent vaccine 
targeting a broadly neutralizing epitope in the minor capsid protein human 
papillomavirus (HPV) that provides broad protection from diverse HPV types in a 
mouse pseudovirus infection model.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Peptides spanning a previously described 
cross-neutralizing epitope from HPV type 16 were genetically inserted at the 
N-terminus of MS2 bacteriophage coat protein. Three of the four recombinant 
L2-coat proteins assembled into VLPs. L2-VLPs elicited high-titer anti-L2 
antibodies in mice, similar to recombinant VLPs that we had previously made in 
which the L2 peptide was displayed on a surface-exposed loop on VLPs of a 
related bacteriophage, PP7. Somewhat surprisingly, L2-MS2 VLPs elicited 
antibodies that were much more broadly cross-reactive with L2 peptides from 
diverse HPV isolates than L2-PP7 VLPs. Similarly, mice immunized with L2-MS2 
VLPs were protected from genital and cutaneous infection by highly diverse HPV 
pseudovirus types.
CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: We show that peptides can be displayed in a highly 
immunogenic fashion at the N-terminus of MS2 coat protein VLPs. A VLP-based 
vaccine targeting HPV L2 elicits broadly cross-reactive and cross-protective 
antibodies to heterologous HPV types. L2-VLPs could serve as the basis of a 
broadly protective second generation HPV vaccine.

Four viral concentration methods were evaluated for their efficiency in 
recovering murine norovirus-1 (MNV-1) (surrogate for human noroviruses (NoV)) 
and MS2 bacteriophages from processing water (1L) and four different types of 
irrigation water (bore hole water, rain water, open well and river water) 
(2-5L). Three methods were based on the viral adsorption and elution principle, 
two methods using an electronegative HA-membrane (Katayama et al., 2002), one 
method using an electropositive Zetapor membrane according to CEN/TC275/WG6/TAG4 
and the fourth method was based on size exclusion using a tangential flow 
filtration system. Detection of MNV-1 was achieved by real-time RT-PCR and 
detection of MS2 by double-layer plaque assay. For the recovery of MNV-1, the 
method using an electronegative HA-filter in combination with an elution buffer 
earlier optimized by Hamza et al. (2009) (Method 1) performed best for all types 
of water (recovery: 5.8-21.9%). In case of MS2 detection, the best method 
depended upon the type of water although Method 1 provided the most consistent 
recovery. To complete this evaluation, the Method 1 was evaluated further for 
the concentration of human enteric viruses (GI and GII NoV, hepatitis A virus 
(HAV) and rotaviruses) in the same five types of water. Although detection of 
rotaviruses (RV) was somewhat less efficient, Method 1 proved reliable for the 
detection of NoV and HAV in all water types. Mean recovery efficiencies ranging 
from 4.8% for detection of GI NoV in open well water to 32.1% for detection of 
HAV in bore hole water, depending on the water type and the viral pathogen 
analyzed.

Human noroviruses (NoVs) are a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis and are 
frequently transmitted by contaminated food, water, hands, and environmental 
surfaces. Little is known about their environmental stability and/or which 
alternative microorganisms can serve as effective surrogates. To examine whether 
Escherichia coli and male-specific coliphage MS2 can be appropriate surrogates 
for NoVs, approximately 6.8 log genomic equivalent copies of Norwalk virus (NV), 
and 6.0 to 6.5 log PFU or CFU of MS2 and E. coli, respectively, were inoculated 
onto stainless steel coupons and held at 4°C, room temperature (RT), or 37°C 
over a period of 75 min (E. coli and MS2) to 4 weeks. These three microorganisms 
were also seeded into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and sampled at different 
time intervals for up to 6 weeks. MS2 and E. coli survived approximately 15 min 
at 37°C, 45 min at RT, and 60 min at 4°C on the stainless steel surfaces. In 
contrast, NV RNA titers were reduced by only 2.4 log at 37°C, 1.5 log at RT, and 
0.9 log at 4°C after 4 weeks. MS2 and E. coli were able to survive at least 5 
weeks in PBS at 4°C and RT, and NV was stable in PBS at 4°C and RT for at least 
6 weeks. However, E. coli, MS2, and NV were completely inactivated after 1-, 4-, 
and 5-week incubations in PBS at 37°C, respectively. These findings indicate 
that NoVs are highly persistent on environmental surfaces and in PBS solution at 
different temperatures. While E. coli does not appear to be an appropriate 
surrogate for NoVs, MS2 could be more relevant for modeling the environmental 
persistence of NoVs under wet conditions, but not under dry conditions.

The fields of nanotechnology and medicine have merged in the development of new 
imaging and drug delivery agents based on nanoparticle platforms. As one 
example, a mutant of bacteriophage MS2 can be differentially modified on the 
exterior and interior surfaces for the concurrent display of targeting 
functionalities and payloads, respectively. In order to realize their potential 
for use in in vivo applications, the biodistribution and circulation properties 
of this class of agents must first be investigated. A means of modulating and 
potentially improving the characteristics of nanoparticle agents is the 
appendage of PEG chains. Both MS2 and MS2-PEG capsids possessing interior DOTA 
chelators were labeled with (64)Cu and injected intravenously into mice 
possessing tumor xenografts. Dynamic imaging of the agents was performed using 
PET-CT on a single animal per sample, and the biodistribution at the terminal 
time point (24 h) was assessed by gamma counting of the organs ex vivo for 3 
animals per agent. Compared to other viral capsids of similar size, the MS2 
agents showed longer circulation times. Both MS2 and MS2-PEG bacteriophage 
behaved similarly, although the latter agent showed significantly less uptake in 
the spleen. This effect may be attributed to the ability of the PEG chains to 
mask the capsid charge. Although the tumor uptake of the agents may result from 
the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect, selective tumor imaging may 
be achieved in the future by using exterior targeting groups.

MS2 VLP-based delivery of microRNA-146a inhibits autoantibody production in 
lupus-prone mice.

BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease 
characterized by the presence of pathogenic autoantibodies. Recent studies 
suggest that microRNAs (miRNAs) play an essential role in immunoregulation and 
may be involved in the pathogenesis of SLE. Therefore, it was of interest to 
investigate the potential therapeutic application of miRNAs in SLE, a concept 
that has not been thoroughly investigated thus far. Virus-like particles (VLPs) 
are a type of recombinant nanoparticle enveloped by certain proteins derived 
from the outer coat of a virus. Herein, we describe a novel miRNA-delivery 
approach via bacteriophage MS2 VLPs and investigate the therapeutic effects of 
miR-146a, a well-studied and SLE-related miRNA, in BXSB lupus-prone mice.
METHODS: VLPs containing miR-146a, and the control VLPs, were prepared using an 
Escherichia coli expression system and then administered to lupus-prone mice 
over a 12-day period. We performed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to 
evaluate the anti-dsDNA antibody, autoantibody to nuclear antigen (ANA), total 
IgG and total IgM levels in serum. The expression of miR-146a was analyzed by 
qRT-PCR. SLE-related cytokines as well as some toll-like receptor signaling 
pathway molecules were also measured.
RESULTS: Treatment with MS2-miR146a VLP showed profound effects on lupus-prone 
BXSB mice, including an increased level of mature miR-146a, which led to a 
significant reduction in the expression of autoantibodies and total IgG. 
Remarkably, these mice also exhibited reduced levels of proinflammatory 
cytokines, including IFN-Interferon-α (IFN-α), Interleukin-1β (Il-1β) and 
Interleukin-6 (Il-6). Moreover, we showed that the toll-like receptor pathway 
was involved in this regulation.
CONCLUSION: Restoring the loss of miR-146a was effective in eliminating the 
production of autoantibodies and ameliorating SLE progression in lupus-prone 
mice. Thus, the induction of dysregulated miRNAs by an MS2 VLP-based delivery 
system may lead to novel therapies.

Live-cell imaging of mRNA yields important insights into gene expression, but it 
has generally been limited to the labeling of one RNA species and has never been 
used to count single mRNAs over time in yeast. We demonstrate a two-color 
imaging system with single-molecule resolution using MS2 and PP7 RNA labeling. 
We use this methodology to measure intrinsic noise in mRNA levels and RNA 
polymerase II kinetics at a single gene.

Ceramic filters, working on the depth filtration principle, are known to improve 
drinking water quality by removing human pathogenic microorganisms from 
contaminated water. However, these microfilters show no sufficient barrier for 
viruses having diameters down to 20 nm. Recently, it was shown that the addition 
of positively charged materials, for example, iron oxyhydroxide, can improve 
virus removal by adsorption mechanisms. In this work, we modified a common 
ceramic filter based on diatomaceous earth by introducing a novel virus 
adsorbent material, magnesium oxyhydroxide, into the filter matrix. Such filters 
showed an improved removal of about 4-log in regard to bacteriophages MS2 and 
PhiX174. This is explained with the electrostatic enhanced adsorption approach 
that is the favorable adsorption of negatively charged viruses onto positively 
charged patches in an otherwise negatively charged filter matrix. Furthermore, 
we provide theoretical evidence applying calculations according to 
Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek theory to strengthen our experimental results. 
However, modified filters showed a significant variance in virus removal 
efficiency over the course of long-term filtration experiments with virus 
removal increasing with filter operation time (or filter aging). This is 
explained by transformational changes of MgO in the filter upon contact with 
water. It also demonstrates that filter history is of great concern when filters 
working on the adsorption principles are evaluated in regard to their retention 
performance as their surface characteristics may alter with use.

Ecological sanitation technologies can be effective in providing health and 
environmental pollution control if they can efficiently reduce the pathogenicity 
of microorganisms carried in fecal material to safe levels. This study evaluated 
the sanitizing effects of different additives for dry treatment of feces from 
urine-diverting dry toilets, based on inactivation of Enterococcus faecalis, 
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, bacteriophages MS2 and ΦX, and Ascaris 
suum. The additives, ash (A) and oyster shell (O) in different amounts and urea 
(U) to optimize the process, were compared with no additive, solely urea, and 
sawdust as controls (C) and were covered ([x%O:A]) or uncovered (x%O:A). The 
main inactivation factors found were desiccation, ammonia content, and pH. S. 
Typhimurium and E. faecalis were more affected by the ammonia content. A 
combination of neutral to high pH and desiccation was most effective for 
inactivation of MS2, and desiccation was most effective for inactivation of ΦX 
and A. suum. The inactivation rate was modeled for all combinations studied. The 
most promising treatments were [150%O:A+U], 150%O:A+U, and 150%O:A. According to 
the models, these could inactivate, for example, 7 log(10) units of all bacteria 
and bacteriophages within 83, 125, and 183 days, respectively. The inactivation 
of A. suum was modeled, albeit the measured decay in egg viability was low.

Tracer experiments were carried out in a naturally discrete-fractured chalk core 
with solute tracers Li(+) and Br(-), and colloidal tracers of two 
origins-bacteriophages (MS2, ϕX174 and T4) and fluorescent latex microspheres. 
The colloidal tracers were either ∼20 nm (MS2, ϕX174 and microspheres) or ∼200 
nm (T4 and microspheres) in size. Both solute and colloidal tracers were 
injected at a constant flux at the fracture inlet and collected at the outlet to 
evaluate the form of their breakthrough curves (BTCs). The BTCs of all tracers 
were compared and analyzed. The BTC analysis displayed significant differences 
in recovery as a function of tracer size and type. Even within the same colloid 
size, transport of the microspheres and bacteriophages was dissimilar, likely 
due to minor differences in density, surface chemistry and shape. More 
pronounced peaks and recoveries were observed with ∼200 nm compared to ∼20 nm 
microspheres and phages. Arrival time at the outlet was also size-dependent, 
with larger microspheres and phages having longer residence times than smaller 
ones, and solutes being 5-15 times slower than colloids of both sizes. The 
observed differences were explained by a combination of size and electrostatic 
interactions that facilitates entrance and transport within the pores in the 
chalk matrix. Overall, our results clearly demonstrate that fractures are 
favorable carriers for viruses of different sizes with different surface 
properties. The viruses' properties were also shown to govern their transport 
through the fractures.

Sunlight inactivation of human viruses and bacteriophages in coastal waters 
containing natural photosensitizers.

Berkeley, Berkeley, California, USA.

Sunlight inactivation of poliovirus type 3 (PV3), adenovirus type 2 (HAdV2), and 
two bacteriophage (MS2 and PRD1) was investigated in an array of coastal waters 
to better understand solar inactivation mechanisms and the effect of natural 
water constituents on observed inactivation rates (k(obs)). Reactor scale 
inactivation experiments were conducted using a solar simulator, and k(obs) for 
each virus was measured in a sensitizer-free control and five unfiltered surface 
water samples collected from different sources. k(obs) values varied between 
viruses in the same water matrix, and for each virus in different matrices, with 
PV3 having the fastest and MS2 the slowest k(obs) in all waters. When exposed to 
full-spectrum sunlight, the presence of photosensitizers increased k(obs) of 
HAdV2, PRD1 and MS2, but not PV3, which provides evidence that the exogenous 
sunlight inactivation mechanism, involving damage by exogenously produced 
reactive intermediates, played a greater role for these viruses. While PV3 
inactivation was observed to be dominated by endogenous mechanisms, this may be 
due to a masking of exogenous k(obs) by significantly faster endogenous k(obs). 
Results illustrate that differences in water composition can shift absolute and 
relative inactivation rates of viruses, which has important implications for 
natural wastewater treatment systems, solar disinfection (SODIS), and the use of 
indicator organisms for monitoring water quality.

A laboratory system for exposing aerosol particles to ozone and rapidly 
measuring the subsequent changes in their single-particle fluorescence is 
reported. The system consists of a rotating drum chamber and a single-particle 
fluorescence spectrometer (SPFS) utilizing excitation at 263 nm. Measurements 
made with this system show preliminary results on the ultra-violet 
laser-induced-fluorescence (UV-LIF) spectra of single aerosolized particles of 
Yersinia rohdei, and of MS2 (bacteriophage) exposed to ozone. When bioparticles 
are exposed in the chamber the fluorescence emission peak around 330 nm: i) 
decreases in intensity relative to that of the 400-550 nm band; and ii) shifts 
slightly toward shorter-wavelengths (consistent with further drying of the 
particles). In these experiments, changes were observed at exposures below the 
US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) limits for ozone.

Controlled integration of gold nanoparticles and organic fluorophores using 
synthetically modified MS2 viral capsids.

94720-1460, USA.

The placement of fluorophores in close proximity to metal nanoparticle surfaces 
is proposed to enhance several photophysical properties of the dyes, potentially 
leading to improved quantum yields and decreased photobleaching. It is difficult 
in practice, however, to establish and maintain the nanoscale distances that are 
required to maximize these effects. The type of metal, size, and shape of the 
nanoparticle, the physical distance separating the metal nanoparticle from the 
organic dye, and the spectral properties of the fluorophore itself are all 
proposed to influence the quantum yield and lifetime. This results in a complex 
behavior that can lead to either enhanced or quenched fluorescence in different 
contexts. In this report, we describe a well-defined system that can be used to 
explore these effects, while physically preventing the fluorophores from 
contacting the nanoparticle surfaces. The basis of this system is the spherical 
protein capsid of bacteriophage MS2, which was used to house gold particles 
within its interior volume. The exterior surface of each capsid was then 
modified with Alexa Fluor 488 (AF 488) labeled DNA strands. By placing AF 488 
dyes at distances of 3, 12, and 24 bp from the surface of capsids containing 10 
nm gold nanoparticles, fluorescence intensity enhancements of 2.2, 1.2, and 1.0 
were observed, respectively. A corresponding decrease in fluorescence lifetime 
was observed for each distance. Because of its well-defined and modular nature, 
this architecture allows the rapid exploration of the many variables involved in 
metal-controlled fluorescence, leading to a better understanding of this 
phenomenon.

Environmental Protection Agency, National Science Foundation and the World 
Health Organization. The device was found capable of inactivating at least 4 
log₁₀ of poliovirus type 1, rotavirus SA-11 and MS-2 virus in 500 mL volumes of 
general case test water. But in the presence of high turbidity and organic 
matter, filtration was necessary to achieve a 4 log₁₀ reduction of the test 
viruses.

Noroviruses are responsible for approximately 44 % of outbreaks involving dairy 
products for which causative agents are reported. Recovery of viruses from milk 
and dairy products is a difficult task. The role of different components of milk 
in the recovery of viral RNA was evaluated in this study. Four model milk 
formulations (A-D) were prepared by mixing different combinations of lactose, 
whey protein, casein, and fat in water. Each model formulation was spiked with 
five concentrations of bacteriophage MS2. The phenol-guanidine 
thiocyanate-chloroform protocol was used for extracting viral RNA from the model 
milk formulations and then extracted RNA was measured by a nanodrop 
spectrophotometer in ng/μl. The results showed that casein and whey protein had 
the highest negative impact on RNA yield, especially when the number of MS2 was 
less than 1.3 pfu/ml. The highest RNA recovery was obtained from the model milk 
formulation containing all four components; lactose, whey protein, casein, and 
fat. The amount of extracted RNA was closely correlated with the dry matter 
content of each formulation and the spiked concentration of coliphage using 
response surface modeling (R²:0.93). It was determined that milk fat is the most 
effective component in facilitating RNA extraction and the highest RNA yield can 
be achieved via elimination of whey protein and casein from milk by 
centrifugation at 40,000×g for 60 min. To achieve the highest viral RNA recovery 
efficiency by the proposed method, milk fat must be recombined with the 
supernatant of the centrifuged sample and then homogenized before performing the 
extraction protocol.

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has become an essential method for the 
detection of viruses in tissue specimens. However, it is well known that the 
presence of PCR inhibitors in tissue samples may cause false-negative results. 
Hence the identification of PCR inhibitors and evaluation and optimization of 
nucleic acid extraction and preservation methods is of prime concern in virus 
discovery programs dealing with animal tissues. Accordingly, to monitor and 
remove inhibitors we have performed comparative analyses of two commonly used 
tissue storage methods and five RNA purification techniques using a variety of 
animal tissues, containing quantified levels of added MS2 bacteriophages as the 
indicator of inhibition. The results showed (i) no significant difference 
between the two methods of sample preservation, viz. direct storage at -80°C or 
4°C in RNAlater, (ii) lung rodent tissues contained lower levels of inhibitor 
than liver, kidney and spleen, (iii) RNA extraction using the EZ1+PK RNA kit was 
the most effective procedure for removal of RT-PCR inhibitors.

Impact of the virus purification protocol on aggregation and electrokinetics of 
MS2 phages and corresponding virus-like particles.

Microbiologie pour l'Environnement), UMR 7564, Nancy, France.

Previous experimental and theoretical studies have established that 
electrokinetic and aggregation properties of soft MS2 phages are not only 
governed by the physico-chemical features of their proteinaceous outer surface 
but are also significantly impacted by those of their inner RNA component (Dika 
et al. Appl. Environ. Microbiol., 2011, 14, 4939-4948). These conclusions 
contradict the recent findings of Nguyen et al. (Soft Matter, 2011, 7, 
10449-10456) who reported identical electrokinetic and aggregation 
characteristics for MS2 and corresponding virus like particles (VLPs) that lack 
the internal RNA component. We demonstrate here that this contradiction 
originates from the different purification methods adopted prior to 
measurements. More generally, we show that stability and electrohydrodynamics of 
viruses differ according to purification by (i) dialysis, (ii) isopycnic 
centrifugation in the cesium chloride gradient, and (iii) precipitation using 
polyethylene glycol (PEG). Methods (i) and (iii) lead to aggregation of MS2 
phages at pH ≤ 4 and pH ≤ 6 in 1-100 mM NaNO3 solutions, respectively, while 
under such conditions aggregation is not observed for MS2 and VLP suspensions 
prepared according to (ii). In addition, VLPs prepared following methods (i) and 
(iii) aggregate only at the isoelectric point (pH ~ 3-4) in 1 mM NaNO3 solution. 
Electrophoretic mobility data of stable MS2 and VLP particles were further 
examined using a recent formalism for electrokinetics of soft multilayered 
colloids. The analysis qualitatively shows how the purification protocol may 
affect either the outer particle surface properties and/or the inner particle 
content. Finally, the non-DLVO aggregation behavior of MS2 and VLPs purified via 
the above protocols is discussed in terms of the possible change in 
corresponding interparticular interactions.

The antiviral activity of several cationic compounds - cetyltrimethylammonium 
bromide (CTAB), chitosan, nisin, and lysozyme - was investigated on the 
bacteriophage c2 (DNA head and non-contractile tail) infecting Lactococcus 
strains and the bacteriophage MS2 (F-specific RNA) infecting E. coli. Firstly, 
these activities were evaluated in a phosphate buffer pH 7 - 10 mM. The CTAB had 
a virucidal effect on the Lactococcus bacteriophages, but not on the MS2. After 
1 min of contact with 0.125 mM CTAB, the c2 population was reduced from 6 to 1.5 
log(pfu)/mL and completely deactivated at 1 mM. On the contrary, chitosan 
inhibited the MS2 more than it did the bacteriophages c2. No antiviral effect 
was observed for the nisin or the lysozyme on bacteriophages after 1 min of 
treatment. A 1 and 2.5 log reduction was respectively observed for nisin and 
lysozyme when the treatment time increased (5 or 10 min). These results showed 
that the antiviral effect depended both on the virus and structure of the 
antimicrobial compounds. The antiviral activity of these compounds was also 
evaluated in different physico-chemical conditions and in complex matrices. The 
antiviral activity of CTAB was impaired in acid pH and with an increase of the 
ionic strength. These results might be explained by the electrostatic 
interactions between cationic compounds and negatively charged particles such as 
bacteriophages or other compounds in a matrix. Milk proved to be protective 
suggesting the components of food could interfere with antimicrobial compounds.

Slow sand filtration (SSF) in drinking water production removes pathogenic 
microorganisms, but detection limits and variable operational conditions 
complicate assessment of removal efficiency. Therefore, a model was developed to 
predict removal of human pathogenic viruses and bacteria as a function of the 
operational conditions. Pilot plant experiments were conducted, in which 
bacteriophage MS2 and Escherichia coli WR1 were seeded as model microorganisms 
for pathogenic viruses and bacteria onto the filters under various temperatures, 
flow rates, grain sizes and ages of the Schmutzdecke. Removal of MS2 was 
0.082-3.3 log10 and that of E. coli WR1 0.94-4.5 log10 by attachment to the sand 
grains and additionally by processes in the Schmutzdecke. The contribution of 
the Schmutzdecke to the removal of MS2 and E. coli WR1 increased with its 
ageing, with sticking efficiency and temperature, decreased with grain size, and 
was modelled as a logistic growth function with scale factor f0 and rate 
coefficient f1. Sticking efficiencies were found to be microorganism and filter 
specific, but the values of f0 and f1 were independent of microorganism and 
filter. Cross-validation showed that the model can be used to predict log 
removal of MS2 and ECWR1 within ±0.6 log. Within the range of operational 
conditions, the model shows that removal of microorganisms is most sensitive to 
changes in temperature and age of the Schmutzdecke.

Materials that interact in a controlled manner with viruses attract increasing 
interest in biotechnology, medicine, and environmental technology. Here, we show 
that virus-material interactions can be guided by intrinsic material surface 
chemistries, introduced by tailored surface functionalizations. For this 
purpose, colloidal alumina particles are surface functionalized with amino, 
carboxyl, phosphate, chloropropyl, and sulfonate groups in different surface 
concentrations and characterized in terms of elemental composition, 
electrokinetic, hydrophobic properties, and morphology. The interaction of the 
functionalized particles with hepatitis A virus and phages MS2 and PhiX174 is 
assessed by virus titer reduction after incubation with particles, activity of 
viruses conjugated to particles, and imaged by electron microscopy. Type and 
surface density of particle functional groups control the virus titer reduction 
between 0 and 99.999% (5 log values). For instance, high sulfonate surface 
concentrations (4.7 groups/nm(2)) inhibit attractive virus-material interactions 
and lead to complete virus recovery. Low sulfonate surface concentrations (1.2 
groups/nm(2)), native alumina, and chloropropyl-functionalized particles induce 
strong virus-particle adsorption. The virus conformation and capsid amino acid 
composition further influence the virus-material interaction. Fundamental 
interrelations between material properties, virus properties, and the complex 
virus-material interaction are discussed and a versatile pool of surface 
functionalization strategies controlling virus-material interactions is 
presented.

light.

University of Patras, Patras 26500, Greece. gios@upatras.gr

In this study, the effects of high frequency ultrasound (US) and visible light 
(VL) on virus inactivation were investigated. The bacteriophages ΦX174 and MS2 
were used as model viruses. The experiments were performed at room temperature 
at three different, relatively high US frequencies (i.e., 582, 862, and 1142 
kHz) with and without the use of VL, and different initial virus concentrations. 
The two bacteriophages were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline solution to a 
titer of 10(3)-10(4)pfu/mL. The experimental virus inactivation data were 
satisfactorily represented by a simple first-order kinetic expression. Virus 
inactivation was faster at the lower frequencies (582 and 862 kHz). Furthermore, 
it was observed that MS2 was inactivated faster than ΦX174. The simultaneous use 
of US and VL was found to be more effective than US alone for MS2 inactivation, 
indicating the existence of a synergistic effect. However, the use of VL in 
conjunction with high frequency US hindered the inactivation of ΦX174.

PRR1 coat protein binding to its RNA translational operator.

3, Box 596, S-751 24 Uppsala, Sweden.

In small RNA bacteriophages, the genomic RNA binds to the coat proteins when the 
viral capsid assembles. This is achieved through sequence-specific interactions 
between a coat-protein dimer and an RNA stem-loop that includes the start codon 
for the replicase gene. The structure of virus-like particles of the small RNA 
phage PRR1 bound to an RNA segment corresponding to this stem-loop has been 
solved and the binding was compared with the related, and better investigated, 
phage MS2. The overall conformation of the RNA is found to be similar and the 
residues that are involved in RNA binding in PRR1 are the same as in MS2. The 
arrangement of the nucleotide bases in the loop of the stem-loop is different, 
leading to a difference in the stacking at the conserved Tyr86, which is 
equivalent to Tyr85 in MS2.

In this study, we introduce a Bayesian approach to address uncertainty of 
microbial recoveries from hollow-fiber ultrafilters (HFUF) and to determine any 
sources of uncertainty. Microbial recoveries were measured under twenty 
conditions, including two types of water, two types of ultrafilters, and five 
types of microorganisms. The probability distributions of the recoveries were 
approximated using Bayesian statistics with Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling 
after integrating the likelihood function of the recovery data and prior 
information about the data. Then a variance-decomposition method was used for 
examining influential factors on microbial recovery by HFUF. The results 
revealed that HFUF efficiently recovered Escherichia coli KO11, E. coli O157:H7 
and bacteriophage MS2, but recoveries for Bacillus atrophaeus spores and 
adenovirus 41 were markedly different between source and treated waters. The 
uncertainty analysis indicated that the probability distributions for recoveries 
had dissimilar patterns under different conditions. Among these test factors, 
the type of microorganisms and associated interaction effects had great impacts 
on the recovery. To sum up, the Bayesian approach to uncertainty analysis shows 
advantages in evaluating the recovery of HFUF by providing its full probability 
distribution.

Inactivation of bacteriophages by high levels of dissolved CO2.

We developed a system with high levels of dissolved CO2 for water disinfection. 
Bacteriophages MS2, Qbeta and phiX174 were selected as the inactivation targets. 
A relatively mild inactivation effect was observed on MS2 and Qbeta at different 
initial concentrations of dissolved CO2 at 0.3 MPa in 20-30 min. When the 
pressure was increased to 0.6 MPa, the inactivation of MS2 and Qbeta was 
differentially improved. However, this system was less effective for the 
inactivation of phiX174. The capsid surface property is a probable reason for 
the low inactivation of phiX174. The pH was not a key factor in the inactivation 
of bacteriophages; moreover, the results obtained using alternative gases 
(pressurized air and O2) indicated that only CO2 inactivated these 
bacteriophages. A comparison between the results of real time polymerase chain 
reaction (RT-PCR) and plaque assay showed that some RNA moved out from the 
capsid after treatment. Capsid damage by CO2 expansion was the likely mechanism 
of inactivation with our method.

Viral disinfection kinetics have been studied in depth, but the molecular-level 
inactivation mechanisms are not understood. Consequently, it is difficult to 
predict the disinfection behavior of nonculturable viruses, even when related, 
culturable viruses are available. The objective of this work was to determine 
how small differences in the composition of the viral genome and proteins impact 
disinfection. To this end, we investigated the inactivation of three related 
bacteriophages (MS2, fr, and GA) by UV254, singlet oxygen ((1)O2), free chlorine 
(FC), and chlorine dioxide (ClO2). Genome damage was quantified by PCR, and 
protein damage was assessed by quantitative matrix-assisted laser desorption 
ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry. ClO2 caused great variability in the 
inactivation kinetics between viruses and was the only treatment that did not 
induce genome damage. The inactivation kinetics were similar for all viruses 
when treated with disinfectants possessing a genome-damaging component (FC, 
(1)O2, and UV254). On the protein level, UV254 subtly damaged MS2 and fr capsid 
proteins, whereas GA's capsid remained intact. (1)O2 oxidized a methionine 
residue in MS2 but did not affect the other two viruses. In contrast, FC and 
ClO2 rapidly degraded the capsid proteins of all three viruses. Protein 
composition alone could not explain the observed degradation trends; instead, 
molecular dynamics simulations indicated that degradation is dictated by the 
solvent-accessible surface area of individual amino acids. Finally, despite the 
similarities of the three viruses investigated, their mode of inactivation by a 
single disinfectant varied. This explains why closely related viruses can 
exhibit drastically different inactivation kinetics.

AIMS: Virus detection has often been difficult due to a low concentration in 
water. In this study, we developed a new procedure based on concentration of 
virus particles on an innovative support: poly-L-lysine dendrigrafts (DGL), 
coupled with directed nucleic acid extraction and real-time PCR quantification.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This method was evaluated using the bacteriophage MS2 as a 
model virus. This virus exhibited the size and structural properties of human 
pathogenic enteric viruses and has often been used to assess new supports of 
concentration. Moreover, this bacteriophage is also a faecal contamination 
indicator. In this study, many water filtration conditions were tested (volume 
of water, concentration, etc.), and more than 80% of bacteriophage were 
recovered after filtration on polymer, in most conditions. We demonstrated that 
the method was linear (slope = 0·99 ± 0·04 and Y intercept when x = -0·02 ± 
0·28), valid (as manipulators, tested concentrations, volumes of sample and 
batch of polymer did not have any influence on concentration) and sensitive 
(allowing to concentrate up to 16,600-fold 1 l of sample and to detect and 
quantify down to 750 GC l(-1) and 7500 GC l(-1), respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: To conclude, this support exhibits high interest to retain viruses 
and to allow to detect low concentration of virus in water.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study gives valuable advance in the 
methods of concentration and diagnosis of virus in water.

Sweep flocculation and adsorption of viruses on aluminum flocs during 
electrochemical treatment prior to surface water microfiltration.

Tanneru CT(1), Rimer JD, Chellam S.

(1)Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Houston, 
Texas 77204-4003, USA.

Bench-scale experiments were performed to evaluate virus control by an 
integrated electrochemical-microfiltration (MF) process from turbid (15 NTU) 
surface water containing moderate amounts of dissolved organic carbon (DOC, 5 mg 
C/L) and calcium hardness (50 mg/L as CaCO3). Higher reductions in MS2 
bacteriophage concentrations were obtained by aluminum electrocoagulation and 
electroflotation compared with conventional aluminum sulfate coagulation. This 
was attributed to electrophoretic migration of viruses, which increased their 
concentrations in the microenvironment of the sacrificial anode where coagulant 
precursors are dissolved leading to better destabilization during electrolysis. 
In all cases, viruses were not inactivated implying measured reductions were 
solely due to their removal. Sweep flocculation was the primary virus 
destabilization mechanism. Direct evidence for virus enmeshment in flocs was 
provided by two independent methods: quantitative elution using beef extract at 
elevated pH and quantitating fluorescence from labeled viruses. Atomic force 
microscopy studies revealed a monotonically increasing adhesion force between 
viruses immobilized on AFM tips and floc surfaces with electrocoagulant dosage, 
which suggests secondary contributions to virus uptake on flocs from adsorption. 
Virus sorption mechanisms include charge neutralization and hydrophobic 
interactions with natural organic matter removed during coagulation. This also 
provided the basis for interpreting additional removal of viruses by the thick 
cake formed on the surface of the microfilter following electrocoagulation. 
Enhancements in virus removal as progressively more aluminum was electrolyzed 
therefore embodies contributions from (i) better encapsulation onto greater 
amounts of fresh Al(OH)3 precipitates, (ii) increased adsorption capacity 
associated with higher available coagulant surface area, (iii) greater 
virus-floc binding affinity due to effective charge neutralization and 
hydrophobic interactions, and/or (iv) additional removal by a dynamic membrane 
if a thick cake layer of flocs is deposited.

Single domain antibody (sdAb)-alkaline phosphatase (AP) fusion proteins have 
been demonstrated to be useful immunodiagnostic reagents for bio-threat agent 
detection. The bivalent nature of sdAb-AP fusion proteins significantly 
increases effective affinity and thus the sensitivity of detection, but the 
thermal stability of the fusion protein had not been explored. This property is 
critical for the development of immunoassays for use in austere environments. In 
this study four sdAbs with specificity for MS2 phage coat protein (CP) were 
expressed as fusions with AP in order to evaluate the thermal stability and 
affinity of the resulting constructs. The melting temperature (Tm) of the sdAb 
and sdAb-AP fusion proteins was measured by a combination of Circular Dichroism 
(CD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fluorescence-based Thermal 
Shift assay. Binding kinetics were assessed using surface plasmon resonance 
(SPR). Our results indicated that the AP fusion protein did not increase the Tm 
or enhance thermal stability of the sdAb, but did provide the expected increase 
in binding affinity as compared to the original sdAb.

Until now, little is known about the influence of food additives on heat 
inactivation of noroviruses. Only a few studies have shown a protective or 
inhibiting effect on virus infectivity caused by the food matrix. Therefore, the 
aim of this study was to examine the influence of sodium chloride, sucrose and 
milk on heat stability of the surrogates murine norovirus (MNV) and MS2 phage at 
60 °C for 1-5 min in PBS for MNV and for 5-120 min in suspension medium buffer 
for MS2 phage. Different concentrations of sodium chloride (5, 10 %) and sucrose 
(5, 50 %) were added to the respective buffers. In addition, commercially 
available milk with different fat concentrations (0.3, 1.5, 3.5 %) was 
investigated in this study. In general, a linear titre reduction for MNV and MS2 
phage could be observed, except for the heat treatment of MNV in PBS with 50 % 
sucrose. A protective effect of PBS with 50 % sucrose and of the matrix milk on 
MNV could be concluded. All other tested conditions did not show any influence 
on virus inactivation. However, MS2 phage did show a higher heat resistance 
throughout the experiments compared to MNV. In future investigations, it should 
be tested, whether the achieved data may be considered in risk assessments of 
heat-treated food products with high concentrations of sugar. Furthermore, it 
should be clarified, whether these results can also be referred to complex food 
matrices.

Determining the stability, or persistence in an infectious state, of foodborne 
viral pathogens attached to surfaces of soft fruits and salad vegetables is 
essential to underpin risk assessment studies in food safety. Here, we evaluate 
the effect of temperature and sunlight on the stability of infectious human 
adenoviruses type 2 and MS2 bacteriophages on lettuce and strawberry surfaces as 
representative fresh products. Human adenoviruses have been selected because of 
their double role as viral pathogens and viral indicators of human fecal 
contamination. Stability assays were performed with artificially contaminated 
fresh samples kept in the dark or under sunlight exposure at 4 and 30°C over 
24h. The results indicate that temperature is the major factor affecting HAdV 
stability in fresh produce surfaces, effecting decay between 3 and 4 log after 
24h at 30°C. The inactivation times to achieve a reduction between 1 and 4-log 
are calculated for each experimental condition. This work provides useful 
information to be considered for improving food safety regarding the 
transmission of foodborne viruses through supply chains.

Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have emerged as a promising alternative to 
conventional disinfection methods to control microbial water quality, yet little 
is known about the fate of viruses in AOPs. In this study, we investigated the 
fate of MS2 coliphage in AOPs that rely on heterogeneous Fenton-like processes 
catalyzed by iron (hydr)oxide particles. Both physical removal of viruses from 
solution via adsorption onto particles as well as true inactivation were 
considered. Virus fate was studied in batch reactors at circumneutral pH, 
containing 200 mg L(-1) of four different commercial iron (hydr)oxide particles 
of similar mesh sizes: hematite (α-Fe2O3), goethite (α-FeOOH), magnetite (Fe3O4) 
and amorphous iron(iii) hydroxide (Fe(OH)3). The effect of adsorption and 
sunlight exposure on the survival of MS2 was considered. On a mass basis, all 
particles exhibited a similar virus adsorption capacity, whereas the rate of 
adsorption followed the order FeOOH > Fe2O3 > Fe3O4 ≈ Fe(OH)3. This adsorption 
behavior could not be explained by electrostatic considerations; instead, 
adsorption must be governed by other factors, such as hydrophobic interactions 
or van der Waals forces. Adsorption to three of the particles investigated 
(α-FeOOH, Fe3O4, Fe(OH)3) caused virus inactivation of 7%, 22%, and 14%, 
respectively. Exposure of particle-adsorbed viruses to sunlight and H2O2 
resulted in efficient additional inactivation, whereas inactivation was 
negligible for suspended viruses. The observed first-order inactivation rate 
constants were 6.6 × 10(-2), 8.7 × 10(-2), 0.55 and 1.5 min(-1) for α-FeOOH, 
α-Fe2O3, Fe3O4 and Fe(OH)3 respectively. In the absence of sunlight or H2O2, no 
inactivation was observed beyond that caused by adsorption alone, except for 
Fe3O4, which caused virus inactivation via a dark Fenton-like process. Overall 
our results demonstrate that heterogeneous Fenton-like processes can both 
physically remove viruses from water as well as inactivate them via adsorption 
and via a particle-mediated (photo-)Fenton-like process.

Molecular methods are increasingly applied for virus detection in environmental 
samples without rendering data on viral infectivity. Infectivity data are 
important for assessing public health risks from exposure to human pathogenic 
viruses in the environment. Here, treatment efficiencies of three (drinking) 
water treatment processes were estimated by quantification of the indicator 
virus bacteriophage MS2 with culture and real-time reverse transcription 
polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). We studied the virus reduction by slow sand 
filtration at a pilot plant. No decay of MS2 RNA was observed, whereas 
infectious MS2 particles were inactivated at a rate of 0.1 day(-1). Removal of 
MS2 RNA and infectious MS2 particles was 1.2 and 1.6 log10-units, respectively. 
Virus reduction by UV and gamma irradiation was determined in laboratory-scale 
experiments. The reduction of MS2 RNA based on qRT-PCR data was negligible. 
Reduction of infectious MS2 particles was estimated at 3.0-3.6 log10-units (UV 
dose up to 400 or 800 J/m(2)) and 4.7-7 log10-units (gamma dose up to 200 Gray). 
As shown in this study, estimations of viral reduction, both inactivation and 
removal, obtained by molecular methods should be interpreted carefully when 
considering treatment options to provide virus-safe drinking water. Combining 
culture-based methods with molecular methods may provide supplementary 
information on mechanisms of virus reduction.

Obtaining an accurate assessment of a treatment system's antimicrobial efficacy 
in recreational water is difficult given the large scale and high flow rates of 
the water systems. A laboratory test system was designed to mimic the water 
conditions and potential microbial contaminants found in swimming pools. This 
system was utilized to evaluate the performance of an in situ ozone disinfection 
device against four microorganisms: Cryptosporidium parvum, bacteriophage MS2, 
Enterococcus faecium, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The sampling regimen evaluated 
the antimicrobial effectiveness in a single pass fashion, with samples being 
evaluated initially after exposure to the ozone unit, as well as at points 
downstream from the device. Based on the flow dynamics and log reductions, cycle 
threshold (Ct) values were calculated. The observed organism log reductions were 
as follows: >6.7 log for E. faecium and P. aeruginosa; >5.9 log for 
bacteriophage MS2; and between 2.7 and 4.1 log for C. parvum. The efficacy 
results indicate that the test system effectively functions as a secondary 
disinfection system as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention's Model Aquatic Health Code.

Australia.

AIMS: Rapid and precise bioaerosol detection in different environments has 
become an important research and technological issue over last decades. 
Previously, we employed a real-time PCR protocol in conjunction with personal 
bioaerosol sampler for rapid detection of airborne viruses. The approach has 
been proved to be specific and sensitive. However, a period of time required for 
entire procedure was in manner of hours. Some new developments are required to 
decrease the detection time down to real-time protocols.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Presently, a surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based 
immunosensor that coupled with a specific antigen-antibody reaction could offer 
sensitive, specific, rapid and label-free detection. This study describes the 
possibility of combining the personal sampler with SPR technology for 
qualitative and extremely rapid detection of airborne micro-organisms. Common 
viral surrogate MS2 bacteriophage, frequently used in bioaerosol studies, was 
employed as a model organism. The results of the sensor functionalizing 
procedure with monoclonal anti-MS2 antibody and optimization of the chip 
performance are presented. The SPR-based detection of the airborne virus was 
found to be very fast; the viral presence was detected in less than 2 min, and 
the entire procedure (sampling and analysis) was undertaken in 6 min, which 
could be considered as real-time detection for this type of measurements.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of SPR with the personal sampler targeted towards 
bioaerosol detection was proven to be feasible. The SPR sensor was found to be 
highly stable and suitable for multiple utilizations without significant 
decrease in response. The suggested approach opens new possibilities for the 
development of portable and rapid (almost real time) bioaerosol monitors.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This technology is the first in the world 
real-time bioaerosol monitor. This outcome would be of strong interest to 
individuals representing public health, biosecurity, defence forces, 
environmental sciences and many others.

Virus inactivation on hard surfaces or in suspension by chemical disinfectants: 
systematic review and meta-analysis of norovirus surrogates.

Norovirus (NoV) infections are the leading cause of foodborne illness in the 
United States. Effective disinfection is important for controlling outbreaks 
caused by this highly infectious virus but can be difficult to achieve because 
NoV is very resistant to many common disinfection protocols. The inability of 
human NoV to replicate in tissue culture complicates NoV research, generally 
necessitating genome copy quantification, the use of surrogate viruses, or the 
use of other substitutes such as virus-like particles. To date, comprehensive 
comparisons among NoV surrogates and between surrogates and human NoV are 
missing, and it is not clear how best to extrapolate information from surrogate 
data. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of comparisons of NoV 
surrogates with regard to their susceptibility to disinfection on hard surfaces 
or in suspension. Restricting our analysis to those studies in which two or more 
virus surrogates were compared allowed us to improve the signal-to-noise ratio 
in our analysis, similar to the epidemiological concept of matching. Using 
meta-analysis methods, our results indicate that hepatitis A virus, murine 
norovirus 1, and phage MS2 are significantly more resistant to disinfection than 
is feline calicivirus, but average differences in viral titer reduction appeared 
to be modest, 1.5 log PFU or less in all cases. None of the studies that 
compared surrogates and human NoV met our inclusion criteria, precluding a 
direct comparison between human NoV and NoV surrogates in this study. For all 
surrogates with sufficient data available to permit subgroup analyses, we 
detected strong evidence that the type of disinfectant impacted the relative 
susceptibility of the surrogates. Therefore, extrapolation of results between 
surrogates or from surrogates to human NoV must consider the type of 
disinfectant studied.

This study aimed to examine the susceptibility of indicator bacteriophages 
towards γ-radiation to evaluate their appropriateness as viral indicators for 
water quality control. The effects of γ-radiation on naturally occurring somatic 
coliphages, F-specific coliphages and Escherichia coli were examined in raw 
sewage and sewage sludge. As well, the effects of radiation on bacteriophages 
ΦX174 and MS2, and E. coli all grown in the laboratory and seeded in distilled 
water, autoclaved raw sewage and a 1% peptone solution were evaluated. The 
inactivation of E. coli was fairly similar in all matrices. In contrast, 
inactivation of bacteriophages was significantly greater in distilled water than 
in the other matrices. These results showed the great influence of the matrix 
characteristics on virus inactivation. Somatic coliphages in raw sewage and 
sewage sludge and ΦX174 in autoclaved sewage were inactivated similarly and were 
far more resistant than F-specific coliphages, MS2 and E. coli. As well, 
F-specific RNA bacteriophages in raw sewage and sewage sludge and MS2 in 
autoclaved sewage were inactivated similarly and were more resistant than E. 
coli. In contrast, MS2 was more susceptible to γ-radiation than E. coli in 
distilled water. Our results showed that ΦX174 is a suitable indicator for 
estimating virus inactivation by γ-irradiation and corroborate the use of 
somatic coliphages to survey the viral quality of treated water and sludges.

Packaging signals in two single-stranded RNA viruses imply a conserved assembly 
mechanism and geometry of the packaged genome.

Analysis, University of York, York YO10 5DD, UK.

The current paradigm for assembly of single-stranded RNA viruses is based on a 
mechanism involving non-sequence-specific packaging of genomic RNA driven by 
electrostatic interactions. Recent experiments, however, provide compelling 
evidence for sequence specificity in this process both in vitro and in vivo. The 
existence of multiple RNA packaging signals (PSs) within viral genomes has been 
proposed, which facilitates assembly by binding coat proteins in such a way that 
they promote the protein-protein contacts needed to build the capsid. The 
binding energy from these interactions enables the confinement or compaction of 
the genomic RNAs. Identifying the nature of such PSs is crucial for a full 
understanding of assembly, which is an as yet untapped potential drug target for 
this important class of pathogens. Here, for two related bacterial viruses, we 
determine the sequences and locations of their PSs using Hamiltonian paths, a 
concept from graph theory, in combination with bioinformatics and structural 
studies. Their PSs have a common secondary structure motif but distinct 
consensus sequences and positions within the respective genomes. Despite these 
differences, the distributions of PSs in both viruses imply defined 
conformations for the packaged RNA genomes in contact with the protein shell in 
the capsid, consistent with a recent asymmetric structure determination of the 
MS2 virion. The PS distributions identified moreover imply a preferred, 
evolutionarily conserved assembly pathway with respect to the RNA sequence with 
potentially profound implications for other single-stranded RNA viruses known to 
have RNA PSs, including many animal and human pathogens.

The asymmetric structure of an icosahedral virus bound to its receptor suggests 
a mechanism for genome release.

Simple, spherical RNA viruses have well-understood, symmetric protein capsids, 
but little structural information is available for their asymmetric components, 
such as minor proteins and their genomes, which are vital for infection. Here, 
we report an asymmetric structure of bacteriophage MS2, attached to its 
receptor, the F-pilus. Cryo-electron tomography and subtomographic averaging of 
such complexes result in a structure containing clear density for the packaged 
genome, implying that the conformation of the genome is the same in each virus 
particle. The data also suggest that the single-copy viral maturation protein 
breaks the symmetry of the capsid, occupying a position that would be filled by 
a coat protein dimer in an icosahedral shell. This capsomere can thus fulfill 
its known biological roles in receptor and genome binding and suggests an exit 
route for the genome during infection.

Virus-like particles (VLPs) generated by heterologous expression of viral 
structural genes have become powerful tools in vaccine development. Recently, we 
and others have reported on the assembly of VLPs of the RNA bacteriophages MS2, 
Qβ, and GA in yeast. Here, we investigate the formation of VLPs of five 
additional phages in the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris, 
namely, the coliphages SP and fr, Acinetobacter phage AP205, Pseudomonas phage 
PP7, and Caulobacter phage φCb5. In all cases except SP, particle formation was 
detected, although VLP outcome varied from 0.2 to 8 mg from 1 g of wet cells. We 
have found that phage φCb5 VLPs easily dissociate into coat protein dimers when 
applied to strong anion exchangers. Upon salt removal and the addition of 
nucleic acid or its mimics and calcium ions, the dimers re-assemble into VLPs 
with high efficiency. A variety of compounds, including RNA, DNA, and gold 
nanoparticles can be packaged inside φCb5 VLPs. The ease with which phage φCb5 
coat protein dimers can be purified in high quantities and re-assembled into 
VLPs makes them attractive for downstream applications including the internal 
packaging of nanomaterials and the chemical coupling of peptides of interest on 
the surface.

This paper demonstrates the additional benefit of the microbicidal efficacy of 
an ozonation plant implemented for micropollutant removal from tertiary 
effluent. Due to the low amount of viruses and protozoa in the tertiary 
effluent, bacteriophage MS2 and spores of Bacillus subtilis were dosed as 
surrogates. At specific ozone consumptions of 0.6 and 0.9 g O3/g dissolved 
organic carbon (DOC) a 2-log colony forming unit (CFU) reduction was achieved 
for indigenous Escherichia coli and enterococci, and the limits of the European 
bathing water directive for the excellent quality of inland waters were met. 
Higher removal was impeded by the shielding effect of suspended solids in the 
effluent, which implies the combination of ozonation with a preceding filtration 
step if higher microbicidal performances are required. The surrogate virus MS2 
was reduced by 4-5 log while no significant inactivation was detected for B. 
subtilis spores. Additionally, the impact of ozonation on the biochemical oxygen 
demand (BOD) was studied. The BOD5 measurement was not adversely affected 
despite the reduced concentration of microorganisms after ozonation. The 
intrinsic increase in BOD5 averaged 15% at 0.6-0.7 g O3/g DOC. The impact of the 
projected increase on the surface water quality is generally not considered a 
problem but has to be assessed on a case-by-case approach.

Inactivation of bacteriophage MS2 by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and triplet 
excited state of dissolved organic matter ((3)DOM*) produced by irradiation of 
natural and synthetic sensitizers with simulated sunlight of wavelengths greater 
than 320 nm was investigated. Natural sensitizers included purified DOM isolates 
obtained from wastewater and river waters, and water samples collected from 
Singapore River, Stamford Canal, and Marina Bay Reservoir in Singapore. Linear 
correlations were found between MS2 inactivation rate constants (kobs) and the 
photo-induced reaction rate constants of 2,4,6-trimethylphenol (TMP), a probe 
compound shown to react mainly with (3)DOM*. Linear correlations between MS2 
kobs and singlet oxygen ((1)O2) concentrations were also found for both purified 
DOM isolates and natural water samples. These correlations, along with data from 
quenching experiments and experiments with synthetic sensitizers, Rose Bengal 
(RB), 3'-methoxyacetophenone (3'-MAP), and nitrite [Formula: see text] , suggest 
that (1)O2, (3)DOM*, and hydroxyl radicals ((•)OH) could inactivate 
bacteriophage MS2. Linear correlations between MS2 kobs and Specific Ultraviolet 
Absorption determined at 254 nm (SUVA254) were also found for both purified DOM 
isolates and natural samples. These results suggest the potential use of TMP as 
a chemical probe and SUVA254 as an indicator for virus inactivation in natural 
and purified DOM water samples.

Germicidal ultraviolet, such as 254-nm UV-C, is a common method of disinfection 
of pathogenic enteric viruses. However, the disinfection efficacies of UV-A or 
-B in terms of inactivating waterborne viruses such as norovirus have not been 
characterized. We evaluated the inactivation kinetics of MS2 bacteriophage and 
murine norovirus (MNV), a surrogate of human norovirus (NoV), by UV-A and -B. In 
addition to UV disinfection, we further investigated whether the presence of 
TiO2 could enhance the virus inactivation kinetics of UV-A and -B. Both MS2 and 
MNV were highly resistant to UV-A. However, the addition of TiO2 enhanced the 
efficacy of UV-A for inactivating these viruses. UV-A dose of 1379 mJ/cm(2) 
resulted in a 4 log10 reduction. In comparison, UV-B alone effectively 
inactivated both MS2 and MNV, as evidenced by the 4 log10 reduction by 367 
mJ/cm(2) of UV-B. The addition of TiO2 increased the inactivation of MS2; 
however, it did not significantly increase the efficacy of UV-B disinfection for 
inactivating MNV. When these treatments were applied to field water such as 
groundwater, the results were generally consistent with the laboratory findings. 
Our results clearly indicated that UV-B is useful for the disinfection of 
waterborne norovirus. However, MNV was quite resistant to UV-A, and UV-A 
effectively inactivated the tested viruses only when used in combination with 
TiO2.

The removal of microorganisms by drinking water treatment processes has been 
widely investigated in laboratory-scale experiments using artificially 
propagated microorganisms. However, this approach cannot be applied to norovirus 
removal, because this virus does not grow in cell or organ culture, and this 
fact has hampered our ability to investigate its behavior during drinking water 
treatment. To overcome this difficulty, our research group previously used 
recombinant norovirus virus-like particles (rNV-VLPs), which consist of an 
artificially expressed norovirus capsid protein, in laboratory-scale drinking 
water treatment experiments. However, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) method generally used to detect rNV-VLPs is not sensitive enough to 
evaluate high removal ratios such as those obtained by ultrafiltration (UF). We 
therefore developed and applied a real-time immuno-polymerase chain reaction 
(iPCR) assay for rNV-VLP quantification to investigate norovirus removal by 
microfiltration (MF), UF, and hybrid precoagulation-MF processes. The rNV-VLP 
detection limit with the developed iPCR assay was improved at least 1000-fold 
compared with ELISA. Whereas MF with a nominal pore size of 0.1 μm could not 
eliminate NV-VLPs, a 4-log reduction was achieved by UF with a molecular weight 
cutoff of 1 kDa. When MF was combined with precoagulation (≥10 μmol-Fe/L for 
ferric chloride; ≥20 μmol-Al/L for polyaluminum chloride; ≥40 μmol-Al/L for 
alum), the performance of the hybrid process in eliminating rNV-VLPs was greater 
than that achieved by the 1 kDa UF. For all processes, the removal ratios of the 
bacteriophages MS2 and Qβ were greater than the rNV-VLP removal ratios by 1-2 
logs, so neither bacteriophage can be recommended as a possible conservative 
surrogate for predicting the behavior of native NV during these processes.

Two types of viral nanoparticles were functionalized with target-specific 
antibodies and multiple copies of an enzymatic reporter (horseradish 
peroxidase). The particles were successfully integrated into an 
immunochromatographic assay detecting MS2 bacteriophage, a model for viral 
pathogens. The sensitivity of the assay was greatly superior to conventional 
gold nanoparticle lateral flow assays, and results could easily be evaluated, 
even without advanced lab instruments.

Male specific RNA (F-RNA) coliphages are used as indicators of fecal 
contamination and for source tracking. However, collecting fecal samples for 
analysis from remote sites is problematic due to the need for an uninterrupted 
cold chain to guarantee sample suitability for downstream molecular detection of 
these coliphages. Here, we investigated the feasibility of using filter paper as 
a collection and storage vehicle for F-RNA coliphages. Various concentrations 
(10(1) to 10(4)pfu) of two F-RNA coliphages, MS2 and Qβ, were prepared in lambda 
buffer or a 10% bovine manure slurry, spotted onto filter paper disks, dried, 
and maintained at 37 °C for up to 37 days. Nucleic acids were extracted from the 
spotted filter paper disks at 0, 6, 13, and 37 days post inoculation and 
analyzed by real time RT-PCR. F-RNA coliphages at concentrations of 
10(2)pfu/filter paper unit were readily detected, and only a slight decrease in 
nucleic acid detection was observed over time. Furthermore, the sensitivity of 
real time RT-PCR detection of the F-RNA coliphage RNA was similar between the 
developed filter paper sampling methodology and traditional cold storage. These 
results indicate that filter paper is a suitable storage and transport medium 
for F-RNA coliphages when refrigeration is not possible.

Measuring transcription dynamics in living cells using fluctuation analysis.

Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.

Single-cell studies of gene regulation suggest that transcription dynamics play 
a fundamental role in determining expression heterogeneity within a population. 
In addition, the three-dimensional organization of the nucleus seems to both 
reflect and influence expression patterns in the cell. Therefore, to gain a 
holistic understanding of transcriptional regulation, it is necessary to develop 
methods for studying transcription of single genes in living cells with high 
spatial and temporal resolution. In this chapter, we describe a recently 
developed approach for visualizing and quantifying pre-mRNA synthesis at a 
single active gene in the nucleus. The approach is based on the high-affinity 
interaction between MS2/PP7 bacteriophage coat proteins and RNA hairpins which 
are transcribed by the gene of interest. The MS2/PP7 coat protein is fused to a 
fluorescent protein and binds the nascent mRNA, allowing for detection of single 
transcription events in the fluorescence microscope. By time-lapse fluorescence 
imaging and quantitative image analysis, one can generate a time trace of 
fluorescence intensity at the site of transcription. By temporal autocorrelation 
analysis, one can determine enzymatic activities of RNAP such as initiation rate 
and elongation rate. In this protocol, we summarize the experimental concept, 
design, and execution for real-time observation of transcription in living 
cells.

phyllosphere and stored grains of wheat (Triticum aestivum).

Cereal crops grown in the biosolids-amended soil can potentially become 
contaminated with pathogenic micro-organisms during growth and at the time of 
harvesting. There is small but unquantified potential risk of transfer of 
enteric pathogens to humans and animals from contaminated plants and grains. 
This study examined decay of Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar 
Typhimurium and bacteriophage MS2 on the wheat phyllosphere and on stored 
grains. This was done to assess the health implications of cereal crops 
contaminated from land application of biosolids. E. coli, S. enterica and MS2 
were inoculated onto the leaves, spikelets and grains of wheat. The change in 
the numbers of inoculated micro-organisms was determined over time to calculate 
the respective 90% reduction time (T90 ) in each of these environments. A rapid 
inactivation (T90 <1-3 days) of E. coli and S. enterica and MS2 from the plant 
phyllosphere was observed, particularly from the spikelets. The decay rates were 
influenced by micro-organism type and location on the plant phyllosphere. Decay 
times on the stored grains were longer (T90 9-71 days), with some observed 
influence of grain variety on pathogen decay times.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Results of this study suggest that there 
is very limited potential of enteric pathogens survival on wheat phyllosphere 
and grains. Therefore, the risk of transfer of enteric pathogens from 
biosolids-amended soil to consumers of grain products is considered to be low. 
This study has important implications for the grains industry, as the results 
suggest that chances of preharvest contamination of grains with enteric 
pathogens from biosolids-amended soil are low.

The coat proteins of single-stranded RNA bacteriophages specifically recognize 
and bind to a hairpin structure in their genome at the beginning of the 
replicase gene. The interaction serves to repress the synthesis of the replicase 
enzyme late in infection and contributes to the specific encapsidation of phage 
RNA. While this mechanism is conserved throughout the Leviviridae family, the 
coat protein and operator sequences from different phages show remarkable 
variation, serving as prime examples for the co-evolution of protein and RNA 
structure. To better understand the protein-RNA interactions in this virus 
family, we have determined the three-dimensional structure of the coat protein 
from bacteriophage Qβ bound to its cognate translational operator. The RNA 
binding mode of Qβ coat protein shares several features with that of the widely 
studied phage MS2, but only one nucleotide base in the hairpin loop makes 
sequence-specific contacts with the protein. Unlike in other RNA phages, the Qβ 
coat protein does not utilize an adenine-recognition pocket for binding a bulged 
adenine base in the hairpin stem but instead uses a stacking interaction with a 
tyrosine side chain to accommodate the base. The extended loop between β strands 
E and F of Qβ coat protein makes contacts with the lower part of the RNA stem, 
explaining the greater length dependence of the RNA helix for optimal binding to 
the protein. Consequently, the complex structure allows the proposal of a 
mechanism by which the Qβ coat protein recognizes and discriminates in favor of 
its cognate RNA.

Plaque analysis allows the determination of phage titer and multiplicity of 
infection. Yet, this overnight assay provides only endpoint results, ignoring 
kinetic aspects. We introduce an alternative high-throughput and rapid method 
for kinetic analysis of lytic coliphage activity. Escherichia coli was infected 
with serial dilutions of MS2 coliphage, and bacterial growth was monitored using 
a multi-well plate reader providing within hours the equivalent data as obtained 
overnight. Additional information is yielded, including phage replication rate, 
progeny size per cycle, and viral propagation during bacterial growth. This 
method offers further insights into physicochemical mechanisms of lytic 
coliphage infection and temporal control. It also provides a virus-host 
interaction acumen.

Iodinated polyurethane (IPU) sponges were prepared by immersing sponges in 
aqueous/organic solutions of iodine or exposing sponges to iodine vapors. Iodine 
was readily adsorbed into the polymers up to 100% (w/w). The adsorption of 
iodine on the surface was characterized by XPS and SEM analyses. The iodine 
loaded IPU sponges were coated with ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), in order to 
release iodine in a controlled rate for water decontamination combined with 
active carbon cartridge, which adsorbs the iodine residues after the microbial 
inactivation. The EVA coated IPU were incorporated in a water purifier and 
tested for iodine release to water and for microbial inactivation efficiency 
according to WQA certification program against P231/EPA for 250l, using 25l a 
day with flow rate of 6-8min/1l. The antimicrobial activity was also studied 
against Escherichia coli and MS2 phage. Bacterial results exceeded the minimal 
requirement for bacterial removal of 6log reduction throughout the entire 
lifespan. At any testing point, no bacteria was detected in the outlet achieving 
more than 7.1 to more than 8log reduction as calculated upon the inlet 
concentration. Virus surrogate, MS2, reduction results varied from 4.11log 
reduction under tap water, and 5.11log reduction under basic water (pH9) to 1.32 
for acidic water (pH5). Controlled and stable iodine release was observed with 
the EVA coated IPU sponges and was effective in deactivating the bacteria and 
virus present in the contaminated water and thus, these iodinated PU systems 
could be used in water purification to provide safe drinking water. These 
sponges may find applications as disinfectants in medicine.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most diagnosed cancer in the western male 
population with high mortality. Recently, alternative approaches based on 
immunotherapy including mRNA vaccines for PCa have shown therapeutic promise. 
However, for mRNA vaccine, several disadvantages such as the instability of 
mRNA, the high cost of gold particles, the limited production scale for 
mRNA-transfected dendritic cells in vitro, limit their development. Herein, 
recombinant bacteriophage MS2 virus-like particles (VLPs), which based on the 
interaction of a 19-nucleotide RNA aptamer and the coat protein of bacteriophage 
MS2, successfully addressed these questions, in which target mRNA was packaged 
by MS2 capsid. MS2 VLP-based mRNA vaccines were easily prepared by recombinant 
protein technology, nontoxic and RNase-resistant. We show the packaged mRNA was 
translated into protein as early as 12 hr after phagocytosed by macrophages. 
Moreover, MS2 VLP-based mRNA vaccines induced strong humoral and cellular immune 
responses, especially antigen-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) and balanced 
Th1/Th2 responses without upregulation of CD4(+) regulatory T cells, and 
protected C57BL/6 mice against PCa completely. As a therapeutic vaccine, MS2 
VLP-based mRNA vaccines delayed tumor growth. Our results provide proof of 
concept on the efficacy and safety of MS2 VLP-based mRNA vaccine, which provides 
a new delivery approach for mRNA vaccine and implies important clinical value 
for the prevention and therapy of PCa.

Chloroplast phosphoglycerate kinase is involved in the targeting of Bamboo 
mosaic virus to chloroplasts in Nicotiana benthamiana plants.

The Bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV) is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. 
Previously, we identified that the chloroplast phosphoglycerate kinase (chl-PGK) 
from Nicotiana benthamiana is one of the viral RNA binding proteins involved in 
the BaMV infection cycle. Because chl-PGK is transported to the chloroplast, we 
hypothesized that chl-PGK might be involved in viral RNA localization in the 
chloroplasts. To test this hypothesis, we constructed two green fluorescent 
protein (GFP)-fused mislocalized PGK mutants, the transit peptide deletion 
mutant (NO TRANSIT PEPTIDE [NOTP]-PGK-GFP) and the nucleus location mutant 
(nuclear location signal [NLS]-PGK-GFP). Using confocal microscopy, we 
demonstrated that NOTP-PGK-GFP and NLS-PGK-GFP are localized in the cytoplasm 
and nucleus, respectively, in N. benthamiana plants. When NOTP-PGK-GFP and 
NLS-PGK-GFP are transiently expressed, we observed a reduction in BaMV coat 
protein accumulation to 47% and 27% that of the wild-type PGK-GFP, respectively. 
To localize viral RNA in infected cells, we employed the interaction of 
NLS-GFP-MS2 (phage MS2 coat protein) with the modified BaMV RNA containing the 
MS2 coat protein binding sequence. Using confocal microscopy, we observed that 
BaMV viral RNA localizes to chloroplasts. Furthermore, elongation factor1a fused 
with the transit peptide derived from chl-PGK or with a Rubisco small subunit 
can partially restore BaMV accumulation in NbPGK1-knockdown plants by helping 
BaMV target chloroplasts.

Determining the composition of messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) particles is 
essential for a comprehensive understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying 
mRNA regulation, but is technically challenging. Here we present an RNA-based 
method to identify RNP components using a modified streptavidin (SA)-binding RNA 
aptamer termed S1m. By optimizing the RNA aptamer S1 in structure and repeat 
conformation, we improved its affinity for SA and found a 4-fold repeat of S1m 
(4×S1m) to be more efficient than the established MS2 and PP7 systems from 
bacteriophages. We then attached the AU-rich element (ARE) of tumor necrosis 
factor alpha (TNFα), a well-known RNA motif that induces mRNA degradation, via 
4×S1m to a SA matrix, and used the resulting RNA affinity column to purify 
ARE-binding proteins (BPs) from cellular extracts. By quantitative mass 
spectrometry using differential dimethyl labeling, we identified the majority of 
established ARE-BPs and detected several RNA-BPs that had previously not been 
associated with AREs. For two of these proteins, Rbms1 and Roxan, we confirmed 
specific binding to the TNFα ARE. The optimized 4×S1m aptamer, therefore, 
provides a powerful tool for the discovery of mRNP components in a single 
affinity purification step.

Considerations regarding the regulation of gene transcription and messenger 
translation.

of Wisconsin, 53706, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.

The RNA sequences in the region of the coat protein gene of MS2/R17 phage, of 
the maturation protein gene ofQβ and of a 6s-RNA transcribed from a presumptive 
gene ofλ were examined. All but five of the 61 amino acid codons are present in 
these messages and although there is some evidence of a bias in the frequency of 
utilization of the codons, there is little evidence to suggest that any codons 
may be forbidden. It is shown that selection has not reduced useless protein 
synthesis by minimizing the number of out of register AUG's or maximizing the 
number of out of register terminating codons in messenger RNA. Secondary 
structures of the RNA's were formulated using a modification of the diagonal 
method of Tinocoet al. (1971). Of the 12 AUG triplets considered in the 
sequences only one is a primary attachment site for ribosomes and it is the only 
one of the 12 that appears in end loops with none of the bases paired. A 
thirteenth AUG triplet appears at the beginning of the 6s-RNAλ gene. Its 
occurrence in an end loop free of base pairing suggests that this is a ribosome 
binding site. It is speculated (1), that transcriptase may recognize its binding 
site on the DNA by a procedure that is in part the analogue of the protein 
synthetase recognizing its binding-initiation site, namely that as the DNA 
strands are separated, a secondary structure forms in the sense strand with a 
CAT in the end loop; (2), that reverse transcriptase might be useful as a means 
of keeping multiple copies of a gene identical if it were to correct the sense 
strand DNA in a DNA-RNA hybrid; and (3), that processing of RNA in the 
intercistronic region normally occurs in the same manner as translation, namely, 
moving the RNA through, three nucleotides at a time.

Mechanisms of MS2 bacteriophage removal by fouled ultrafiltration membrane 
subjected to different cleaning methods.

Urbana-Champaign , Urbana, Illinois 61801, United States.

An ultrafiltration unit with a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane of 40 nm 
nominal pore size was used to study bacteriophage MS2 removal under different 
membrane conditions: pristine membrane, membrane fouled by soluble microbial 
product (SMP) extracted from membrane bioreactor (MBR) feedwater, backwashed 
membrane, and chemically cleaned membrane. The order of MS2 removal by these 
membranes was as follows: fouled membrane > backwashed membrane > chemically 
cleaned membrane ≈ pristine membrane. A linear correlation between membrane 
relative permeability and MS2 removal was found. Mass balance analysis showed a 
high percentage of MS2 in the concentrate for the fouled membrane as compared 
with the pristine membrane. Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) results showed 
faster kinetics of MS2 adhesion to the pristine membrane than to the SMP-fouled 
membrane. In agreement with QCM results, an attractive force between MS2 and the 
pristine membrane was detected using an atomic force microscope (AFM), whereas a 
repulsive force was detected for the interaction between MS2 and the fouled 
membrane. The presence of SMP on the membrane surface led to higher rejection of 
MS2 due to both pore blocking and repulsion between MS2 and the SMP layer. 
Chemical cleaning removed most of the SMP foulant and as a result led to a lower 
MS2 removal.

Microbial inactivation by cupric ion in combination with H2O2: role of reactive 
oxidants.

The cupric ion mediated inactivation of Escherichia coli was enhanced by the 
presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), with increasing inactivation efficacy 
observed in response to increasing concentrations of H2O2. The biocidal activity 
of the Cu(II)/H2O2 system is believed to result from the oxidative stress caused 
by reactive oxidants such as the hydroxyl radical ((•)OH), cupryl species 
(Cu(III)), and the superoxide radical (O2(•-)), which are produced via the 
catalytic decomposition of H2O2. In E. coli cells treated with Cu(II) and H2O2, 
the intracellular level of (•)OH and Cu(III) increased significantly, leading to 
complete disruption of cell membranes. On the basis of experimental observations 
made using an (•)OH scavenger, copper-chelating agents, and superoxide 
dismutase, it is concluded that Cu(III) is the predominant species responsible 
for the death of E. coli cells. It was also found that the production of Cu(III) 
was promoted by the reactions of copper with intracellular O2(•-). MS2 coliphage 
was found to be even more susceptible than E. coli to the oxidative stress 
induced by the Cu(II)/H2O2 system.

assay. Although current plaque assays work well in enumeration of MS2 in 
environmental samples, quantification of MS2 calls for better visibility and 
higher consistency. In an attempt to improve the visibility and consistency of 
the current plaque assay, spread plate technique was introduced, instead of the 
pour plate technique used commonly in existing methods. Other parameters that 
influence the outcome of the plaque assay were also compared. Using spread plate 
technique resulted in an increase of plaque size by approximately 50% and 
contributed to a better visibility. Addition of supplements (glucose, CaCl2 and 
thiamine); reduction of agar thickness and hardness, also contributed to 
enhanced plaque visibility and increased plaque count. Among all the conditions 
tested, a supplemented thin bottom agar (10ml 1% agar) and a supplemented thin 
top agar (10ml 0.45% agar) with spread plate technique gave the maximum 
countable plaques with a minimum standard deviation. When compared to other 
methods, it produced significantly higher plaque count and lower variation. The 
optimized plaque assay significantly improved visibility and consistency of the 
existing plaque assay methods and could be used in quantification of MS2.

The disinfection efficiency of performic acid (PFA) against various microbial 
contaminants has been studied in municipal secondary effluent. The study 
demonstrated that PFA provides rapid, efficient and safe disinfection, degrading 
both bacteria and viruses even at low doses. The resistance order starting from 
the most resistant microorganism is as follows: MS2-coliphages > DNA-coliphages 
> enterococci and Escherichia coli. PFA is also efficient in the elimination of 
Salmonella spp., Clostridium perfringens spores and Giardia cysts. The results 
showed that a PFA dose as low as 0.5-1 mg L(-1) with contact time of 10 min was 
efficient in achieving and maintaining for 72 h the disinfection level required 
for unrestricted agricultural water reuse (≤3 log units for faecal coliforms). 
However, the optimal dose will depend on the quality of wastewater. Regarding 
the formation of by-products during disinfection with PFA, very low amounts of 
hydrogen peroxide and organic per-acids were observed; active oxygen was not 
detected. The amounts of adsorbable organically bound halogens (AOX) compounds 
formed were significantly lower compared to the amounts generated during 
chlorine disinfection. This chlorine-free solution enables compliance with 
microbiological criteria for various water reuse applications and is already on 
the market for advanced disinfection.

Fecal contamination of shellfish growing seawater with enteric viruses is often 
associated with human outbreaks of gastroenteritis. Male specific bacteriophage 
MS2 is correlated with those of enteric viruses in a wide range of water 
environments and has been used widely as a surrogate for pathogenic waterborne 
viruses. Since viruses in contaminated water are usually at low levels, the 
development of methods to concentrate viruses from water is crucial for 
detection purposes. In the present study, granular activated carbon was 
evaluated for concentration of MS2 from artificial seawater, and different 
parameters of the seawater were also compared. Recovery of MS2 from warm 
seawater (37°C) was found to be significantly greater than from cold seawater (4 
and 20°C), and even greater than from fresh water (4, 20 and 37°C); the 
difference between seawater and fresh water became less profound when the 
temperatures of both were below 37°C. Although not of statistical significance, 
recovery of MS2 from low salinity seawater (10 and 20 parts per thousand, ppt) 
was greater than from high salinity seawater (30 and 40ppt). One gram of 
granular activated carbon was able to extract 6-log plaque forming units (PFU) 
of MS2 from 500ml seawater at 37°C. This study demonstrated that granular 
activated carbon can concentrate an enteric virus indicator from shellfish 
growing seawater effectively.

The biosand filter is a household-scale point-of-use water filtration system 
based on slow sand filtration, but modified for intermittent operation. Studies 
on slow sand filters show that intermittent operation reduces filter 
effectiveness. However, continuous versus intermittent operation of biosand 
filters has never been compared. Eight 10-cm diameter columns were constructed 
to represent field biosand filters. Five were operated intermittently with a 
24-h residence period, while the remaining three were operated continuously. 
Continuous operation of the filters resulted in significantly better reduction 
of Escherichia coli (3.71 log10 versus 1.67 log10), bacteriophage MS2 
(2.25 log10 versus 0.85 log10), and turbidity (96% versus 87%). Dissolved oxygen 
levels at 5 and 10 cm of media depth in intermittent filters reached an average 
of 0 mg/L by 24 h of residence time on day 60 of the experiment. A simple 
numerical model was developed to describe E. coli removal during ripening from 
days 0-58 for continuously operated versus intermittent filters. This research 
confirms that although biosand filters were developed for intermittent 
operation, the filters perform significantly better when operated continuously. 
However, both operational modes resulted in a significant reduction of microbial 
indicators.

Inactivation of MS2 coliphage by UV and hydrogen peroxide: comparison by 
cultural and molecular methodologies.

The use of advanced oxidation processes (AOP) are expected to increase for 
removal of emerging contaminants and pathogens from drinking water. In this 
study, the performance of a small community ultraviolet light reactor in 
combination with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for MS2 coliphage inactivation with 
two different flow rate conditions of 1 gal/min (gpm) and 2 gpm was evaluated. 
Following UV radiation, MS2 showed a reduction of 5.3-5.8 log10 when quantified 
with cultural plaque counts, whereas corresponding quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction (qPCR) data showed only a 1.7-2.8 log10 reduction in viral RNA copy 
number. When H2O2 was added at either 2.5 or 5 ppm with UV at both flow rate 
conditions, enhanced MS2 inactivation occurred with a more than 7 log10 
reduction observed via plaque counts, indicating that all added MS2 had been 
inactivated, since no plaques were formed after incubation at 37 °C for 24 h. In 
contrast, qPCR only showed a corresponding 3-4 log10 reduction in viral RNA copy 
number. This research also sheds light on the inactivation of MS2 with 
ultraviolet light and in the presence of hydroxyl radicals and provides a 
practical use of qPCR to detect MS2 concentration following advanced oxidation 
relative to traditional plaque methodology; however qPCR detection overestimates 
the true number of infective virus.

Electrochemical biosensors featuring oriented antibody immobilization via 
electrografted and self-assembled hydrazide chemistry.

Australia 5001, Australia.

Appropriate site-directed chemistry is essential to maximize the performance of 
immunosensors. We present two new functionalization strategies that preserve 
proper folding and binding potential of antibodies by forcing their oriented 
immobilization. Both strategies are based on the formation of hydrazone bonds 
between aldehyde groups on the Fc moieties of periodate-oxidized antibodies and 
hydrazide groups on functionalized gold electrodes. Those hydrazide groups are 
introduced by electrografting of diazonium salts or by self assembly of mono- 
and dithiolated hydrazide linkers, resulting in films with tailored functional 
groups and, thus, antibody distribution and spacing. Their barrier properties 
and permeability toward electroactive species are evaluated. To demonstrate the 
potential of these new functionalization strategies, detection of bacteriophage 
MS2 is performed through either a direct assay using electrochemical impedance 
spectroscopy (EIS) or through a sandwich assay using differential pulse 
voltammetry (DPV). Diazonium and monothiolated self-assembled monolayer-modified 
electrodes enable the detection of less than 1 plaque forming unit (pfu)/mL in a 
direct EIS assay. However, nonspecific adsorption renders measurements in river 
water samples difficult. In contrast, sandwich-assays on electrodes with 
electrografted diazonium salts and monothiolated self-assembled monolayers do 
not show significant matrix effects using river water samples, but the limits of 
detection are 10(8) times higher than those of the direct assay. Best results 
are achieved for immunosensors based on mixed monolayers of hydrazide and 
hydroxyl diothiolated linkers (15 pfu/mL). These new functionalization 
techniques are facile to implement. They afford the possibility to tune the 
surface composition and tailor the electrochemical properties of electrochemical 
sensors. These advantages should translate into broad interest in this type of 
surface chemistry for biosensor development.

In 2012 more than 4 million people used a ceramic pot filter (CPF) as household 
water treatment system for their daily drinking water needs. In the normal 
production protocol most low cost filters are impregnated with a silver solution 
to enhance the microbial removal efficiency. The aim of this study was to 
determine the role of silver during the filtration and subsequent storage. 
Twenty-two CPFs with three different silver applications (non, only outside and 
both sides) were compared in a long-term loading experiment with Escherichia 
coli (K12 and WR1) and MS2 bacteriophages in natural challenge water under 
highly controlled laboratory circumstances. No significant difference in Log 
Removal Values were found between the filters with different silver 
applications. The results show that the storage time in the receptacle is the 
dominant parameter to reach E. coli inactivation by silver, and not the contact 
time during the filtration phase. The hypothesis that the absence of silver 
would enhance the virus removal, due to biofilm formation on the ceramic filter 
element, could not be confirmed. The removal effectiveness for viruses is still 
of major concern for the CPF. This study suggests that the ceramic pot filter 
characteristics, such as burnt material content, do not determine E. coli 
removal efficacies, but rather the contact time with silver during storage is 
the dominant parameter to reach E. coli inactivation.

Bacteriophages are often used as surrogates for enteric viruses in spiking 
experiments to determine the efficiencies of virus removal of certain water 
treatment measures, like e.g. flocculation or filtration steps. Such spiking 
experiments with bacteriophages are indispensable if the natural virus 
concentrations in the raw water of water treatment plants are too low to allow 
the determination of elimination levels over several orders of magnitude. In 
order to obtain reliable results from such spiking tests, it is essential that 
bacteriophages behave comparable to viruses and remain stable during the 
experiments. To test this, the influence of flocculation parameters on the 
bacteriophages MS2, Qβ and phiX174 was examined. Notably, the F-specific phages 
MS2 and Qβ were found to be inactivated in flocculation processes with 
polyaluminum chloride (PACl). In contrast, other aluminum coagulants like AlCl3 
or Al2(SO4)3 did not show a comparable effect on MS2 in this study. In 
experiments testing the influence of different PACl species on MS2 and Qβ 
inactivation during flocculation, it could be shown that cationic dissolved PACl 
species (Al13) interacted with the MS2 surface and hereby reduced the surviving 
phage fraction to c/c0 values below 1*10(-4) even at very low PACl 
concentrations of 7 μmol Al/L. Other inactivation mechanisms like the 
irreversible adsorption of phages to the floc structure or the damage of phage 
surfaces due to entrapment into the floc during coagulation and floc formation 
do not seem to contribute to the low surviving fraction found for both 
F-specific bacteriophages. Furthermore, no influence of phage agglomeration or 
pH drops during the flocculation process on phage inactivation could be 
observed. The somatic coliphage phiX174 in contrast did not show sensitivity to 
chemical stress and in accordance only slight interaction between Al13 and the 
phage surface was observed. Consequently, F-specific phages like MS2 should not 
be used as surrogate for viruses in flocculation experiments with PACl to 
determine the removal rates of viruses, as the results are influenced by a 
strong inactivation of the bacteriophages due to the experimental conditions.

Solid supported fullerene materials are prepared in aims of creating a 
fullerene-based photocatalyst that is capable of producing (1)O2 in the aqueous 
phase. Past studies of using fullerene as a photocatalyst in water have 
exclusively focused on using water soluble fullerene derivatives and employed 
sophisticated chemistry to create immobilized fullerene materials. The method 
presented herein is much less synthetically complex and utilizes pristine 
fullerene, providing a drastically simpler route to supported fullerene 
materials and furthering their potential for use in environmental applications. 
Covalent immobilization was achieved through the nucleophilic addition of a 
terminal amine (located on a solid support) across a [6,6] fullerene double 
bond, resulting in attachment directly to C60's cage. Immobilization allowed 
supported fullerene moieties to produce (1)O2 in water under various 
illumination conditions and inactivate MS2 bacteriophages. In a water with 
natural organic matter, supported fullerene materials produced (1)O2 under 
visible light irradiation without exhibiting significant loss of photocatalytic 
activity after successive cycling.

Separating CBRN mixed samples that contain both chemical and biological warfare 
agents (CB mixed sample) in liquid and solid matrices remains a very challenging 
issue. Parameters were set up to assess the performance of a simple 
filtration-based method first optimized on separate C- and B-agents, and then 
assessed on a model of CB mixed sample. In this model, MS2 bacteriophage, 
Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis baculovirus (AcNPV), Bacillus 
atrophaeus and Bacillus subtilis spores were used as biological agent simulants 
whereas ethyl methylphosphonic acid (EMPA) and pinacolyl methylphophonic acid 
(PMPA) were used as VX and soman (GD) nerve agent surrogates, respectively. 
Nanoseparation centrifugal devices with various pore size cut-off (30 kD up to 
0.45 µm) and three RNA extraction methods (Invisorb, EZ1 and Nuclisens) were 
compared. RNA (MS2) and DNA (AcNPV) quantification was carried out by means of 
specific and sensitive quantitative real-time PCRs (qPCR). Liquid chromatography 
coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC/TOFMS) methods was used for 
quantifying EMPA and PMPA. Culture methods and qPCR demonstrated that membranes 
with a 30 kD cut-off retain more than 99.99% of biological agents (MS2, AcNPV, 
Bacillus Atrophaeus and Bacillus subtilis spores) tested separately. A rapid and 
reliable separation of CB mixed sample models (MS2/PEG-400 and MS2/EMPA/PMPA) 
contained in simple liquid or complex matrices such as sand and soil was also 
successfully achieved on a 30 kD filter with more than 99.99% retention of MS2 
on the filter membrane, and up to 99% of PEG-400, EMPA and PMPA recovery in the 
filtrate. The whole separation process turnaround-time (TAT) was less than 10 
minutes. The filtration method appears to be rapid, versatile and extremely 
efficient. The separation method developed in this work constitutes therefore a 
useful model for further evaluating and comparing additional separation 
alternative procedures for a safe handling and preparation of CB mixed samples.

Laboratory studies of virus aerosols have been criticized for generating 
airborne viruses from artificial nebulizer suspensions (e.g., cell culture 
media), which do not mimic the natural release of viruses (e.g., from human 
saliva). The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of human 
saliva on the infectivity and survival of airborne virus and to compare it with 
those of artificial saliva and cell culture medium. A stock of MS2 bacteriophage 
was diluted in one of three nebulizer suspensions, aerosolized, size selected 
(100 to 450 nm) using a differential mobility analyzer, and collected onto 
gelatin filters. Uranine was used as a particle tracer. The resulting particle 
size distribution was measured using a scanning mobility particle sizer. The 
amounts of infectious virus, total virus, and fluorescence in the collected 
samples were determined by infectivity assays, quantitative reverse 
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), and spectrofluorometry, respectively. For all 
nebulizer suspensions, the virus content generally followed a particle volume 
distribution rather than a number distribution. The survival of airborne MS2 was 
independent of particle size but was strongly affected by the type of nebulizer 
suspension. Human saliva was found to be much less protective than cell culture 
medium (i.e., 3% tryptic soy broth) and artificial saliva. These results 
indicate the need for caution when extrapolating laboratory results, which often 
use artificial nebulizer suspensions. To better assess the risk of airborne 
transmission of viral diseases in real-life situations, the use of natural 
suspensions such as saliva or respiratory mucus is recommended.

Evaluating efficacy of field-generated electrochemical oxidants on disinfection 
of fomites using bacteriophage MS2 and mouse norovirus MNV-1 as pathogenic virus 
surrogates.

Surface disinfection, as part of environmental hygiene practices, is an 
efficient barrier to gastroenteritis transmission. However, surface 
disinfectants may be difficult to obtain in remote, resource-limited, or 
disaster relief settings. Electrochemical oxidants (ECO) are chlorine-based 
disinfectants that can be generated using battery power to electrolyze brine 
(NaCl) solutions. Electrolysis generates a mixed-oxidant solution that contains 
both chlorine (HOCl, OCl(-)) and reactive oxygen species (e.g., ·OH, O3, H2O2, 
and ·O2-) capable of inactivating pathogens. One onsite generator of ECO is the 
Smart Electrochlorinator 200 (SE-200, Cascade Designs, Inc.). In a laboratory 
study, we assessed ECO surface disinfection efficacy for two gastrointestinal 
virus surrogates: bacteriophage MS2 and murine norovirus MNV-1. We quantified 
both infectivity and nucleic acid inactivation using culture-dependent and 
independent assays. At free available chlorine concentrations of 2,500 ppm and a 
contact time of 30 s, ECO inactivation of infective MS2 bacteriophage exceeded 7 
log10 compared to MNV-1 disinfection of approximately 2 log10. Genomic RNA 
inactivation was less than infective virus inactivation: MS2 RNA inactivation 
was approximately 5 log10 compared to MNV-1 RNA inactivation of approximately 
1.5 log10. The results are similar to inactivation efficacy of household bleach 
when used at similar free available chlorine concentrations. Our work 
demonstrates the potential of ECO solutions, generated onsite, to be used for 
surface disinfection.

Research Center (ERC).

The endogenous sunlight inactivation rates of MS2 coliphage in 
photosensitizer-free water were measured (kobs) under different light conditions 
and compared to modeled inactivation rates (kmod) computed using a previously 
published action spectrum. Experiments were conducted under simulated and 
natural sunlight. There was generally good agreement between modeled and 
observed MS2 sunlight inactivation rates in the summer and winter, suggesting 
that the action spectrum can be used to predict changes in the inactivation rate 
caused by diurnal and seasonal changes in natural sunlight irradiance. However, 
we show that a major source of uncertainty in the predictions is the ability to 
accurately measure or model the comparatively weak and highly variable solar 
irradiance between 280 and 300 nm, a range to which the inactivation rate is 
very sensitive. The action spectrum was also used to predict the endogenous 
inactivation rates of MS2 at different depths in a column of strongly 
humic-colored [i.e., solar ultraviolet (UV)-attenuating] wetland water under 
simulated sunlight; we observed fairly good agreement between kobs and kmod, 
suggesting that the action spectrum can be used to estimate the decrease in the 
endogenous inactivation rate caused by spectrally selective sunlight attenuation 
in the water column.

Pathogenic viruses are emerging contaminants in water which should be analyzed 
for water safety to preserve public health. A strategy was developed to quantify 
RNA and DNA viruses in parallel on chemiluminescence flow-through 
oligonucleotide microarrays. In order to show the proof of principle, 
bacteriophage MS2, ΦX174, and the human pathogenic adenovirus type 2 (hAdV2) 
were analyzed in spiked tap water samples on the analysis platform MCR 3. The 
chemiluminescence microarray imaging unit was equipped with a Peltier heater for 
a controlled heating of the flow cell. The efficiency and selectivity of DNA 
hybridization could be increased resulting in higher signal intensities and 
lower cross-reactivities of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products from other 
viruses. The total analysis time for DNA/RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis for RNA 
viruses, polymerase chain reaction, single-strand separation, and 
oligonucleotide microarray analysis was performed in 4-4.5 h. The parallel 
quantification was possible in a concentration range of 
9.6 × 10(5)-1.4 × 10(10) genomic units (GU)/mL for bacteriophage MS2, 
1.4 × 10(5)-3.7 × 10(8) GU/mL for bacteriophage ΦX174, and 
6.5 × 10(3)-1.2 × 10(5) for hAdV2, respectively, by using a measuring 
temperature of 40 °C. Detection limits could be calculated to 6.6 × 10(5) GU/mL 
for MS2, 5.3 × 10(3) GU/mL for ΦX174, and 1.5 × 10(2) GU/mL for hAdV2, 
respectively. Real samples of surface water and treated wastewater were tested. 
Generally, found concentrations of hAdV2, bacteriophage MS2, and ΦX174 were at 
the detection limit. Nevertheless, bacteriophages could be identified with 
similar results by means of quantitative PCR and oligonucleotide microarray 
analysis on the MCR 3.

The UV inactivation kinetics of bacteriophages MS2, PhiX174, T1 and PRD1 and the 
potential of bacterial UV repair mechanisms to reactivate these bacteriophages 
is described here. The selected bacteriophages represent a range of genome size, 
single and double stranded genomes, circular and linear organization and RNA and 
DNA. Bacteriophages were exposed to UV irradiation from two different collimated 
beam UV irradiation sources (medium-pressure (MP) mercury lamps and low-pressure 
(LP) mercury lamps) and assayed during which host-phage cultures were exposed to 
photoreactivating light for 6 h, then incubated overnight at 37 °C in the dark. 
Dark controls following UV exposure were performed in parallel. UV inactivation 
kinetics (using dark controls) showed that circular ssDNA phage (PhiX174) was 
the most sensitive and linear ssRNA phage (MS2) was the more resistant phage. No 
photoreactivation was observed for MS2 (RNA phage) and the highest 
photoreactivation was observed for PRD1. In the case of PRD1, the dose required 
for 4-log reduction (dark control) was around 35 mJ/cm(2), with a similar dose 
observed for both UV sources (MP and LP). When the photoreactivation step was 
added, the dose required for 4-log reduction using LP lamps was 103 mJ/cm(2) and 
for MP lamps was 60 mJ/cm(2). Genome organization differences between 
bacteriophages play an important role in resistance to UV inactivation and 
potential photoreactivation mediated by bacterial host mechanisms. The use of 
photoreactivation during the assay of PRD1 creates a more conservative surrogate 
for potential use in UV challenge testing.

Transport and removal of bacteriophages MS2 and PhiX174 in steel slag-amended 
soils: column experiments and transport model analyses.

Park JA, Kang JK, Kim JH, Kim SB, Yu S, Kim TH.

The aim of this study was to investigate the removal of bacteriophages MS2 and 
PhiX174 in soils amended with converter furnace steel slag. Column experiments 
were performed to examine the bacteriophage removal in slag-amended (slag 
content: 0%, 25%, and 50%) loam soils. For comparison, column experiments were 
also conducted with Escherichia coli. In addition, chloride (Cl) was used as a 
conservative tracer to determine transport characteristics. Results showed mass 
recoveries of Cl of 98.6 +/- 3.5%, indicating that the experiments were 
conducted successfully. The mass recovery of MS2 was 86.7% in no slag (100% 
soil), decreasing to 0% in slag contents of 25% and 50%. The mass recovery of 
PhiX174 decreased from 87.8% to 51.5% with increasing slag content from 0% to 
50%. In the case of E. coli, the mass recoveries decreased from 47.0% to 10.5% 
with increasing slag content from 0% to 50%. In the transport models analyses, 
the HYDRUS-1D code was used to quantify the sorption parameters from 
breakthrough curves. For the 100% soil column, a one-site kinetic sorption model 
was fitted to the data, whereas a two-site kinetic sorption model was fitted for 
slag-amended (25% and 50% slag) soil data. Results demonstrate that the addition 
of steel slag to soil enhances the removal of bacteriophages due to the presence 
of FeO in the steel slag. However, CaO could not contribute to the bacteriophage 
removal in our experimental conditions because the effluent pH (7.7-8.9) in 
slag-amended (25% and 50% slag) soils was not high enough to promote the 
bacteriophage inactivation.

Enteric viral contaminants in water represent a public health concern, thus 
methods for detecting these viruses or their indicator microorganisms are 
needed. Because enteric viruses and their viral indicators are often found at 
low concentrations in water, their detection requires upfront concentration 
methods. In this study, a strong basic anion exchange resin was evaluated as an 
adsorbent material for the concentration of F-RNA coliphages (MS2, Qβ, GA, and 
HB-P22). These coliphages are recognized as enteric virus surrogates and fecal 
indicator organisms. Following adsorption of the coliphages from 50ml water 
samples, direct RNA isolation and real time RT-PCR detection were performed. In 
water samples containing 10(5)pfu/ml of the F-RNA coliphages, the anion exchange 
resin (IRA-900) adsorbed over 96.7% of the coliphages present, improving real 
time RT-PCR detection by 5-7 cycles compared to direct testing. F-RNA coliphage 
RNA recovery using the integrated method ranged from 12.6% to 77.1%. Resin-based 
concentration of samples with low levels of the F-RNA coliphages allowed for 
10(0)pfu/ml (MS2 and Qβ) and 10(-1)pfu/ml (GA and HB-P22) to be detected. The 
resin-based method offers considerable advantages in cost, speed, simplicity and 
field adaptability.

Human noroviruses (NoVs) are the leading cause of gastroenteritis and foodborne 
illnesses worldwide. In this study, we investigated the effects of persimmon 
extract (PE) on NoV GII.4 and bacteriophage MS2. We also examined the 
relationship between the tannin content of PE and its antiviral effects to 
identify the active ingredient in PE. Different persimmon tannin (PT) solutions 
were prepared by mixing PE with different concentrations of bovine serum 
albumin. The antiviral efficacy of these solutions against NoV was evaluated by 
quantifying the amount of residual noroviral genome using a quantitative reverse 
transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assay. The antiviral efficacy of PE against MS2 was 
examined with an infectivity assay (plaque assay). Solutions containing ≥ 0.11 
mg/mL PT reduced the noroviral genome by more than 70.0% and the infectivity of 
MS2 by more than 2.5 log PFU/mL. However, the effects of PT on both viruses 
decreased markedly at a concentration of 0.08 mg/mL and solutions containing 
negligible PT had no antiviral activity. These results suggest that the PT 
component of PE inactivates NoV and MS2. Our results indicate that PE is a 
nontoxic antiviral agent effective against enteric viruses.
PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Persimmon extract showed antiviral effects against NoV 
and bacteriophage MS2. Persimmon extract is suitable for use as an antiviral 
agent.

There is a growing need for better assessment of health risks associated with 
land-applied biosolids. This study investigated in-situ decay of seeded human 
adenovirus (HAdV), Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, and bacteriophage 
(MS2) in biosolids-amended soil under wheat cultivation. The biosolids seeded 
with microorganisms were placed in decay chambers which were then placed in the 
topsoil (10 cm depth) at three different sites. Sites were selected in arid 
wheat-growing regions of Australia with loamy-sand soil type (Western Australia) 
and sandy soil (South Australia). Seeded E. coli and S. enterica had a 
relatively short decay time (T90 = 4-56 days) in biosolids-amended soil compared 
to un-amended soil (T90 = 8-83 days). The decreasing soil moisture over the 
wheat-growing season significantly (P < 0.05) influenced survival time of both 
bacteria and MS2 at Western Australia (Moora) and South Australia (Mt Compass) 
sites, particularly in the un-amended soils. Increasing soil temperature also 
significantly (P < 0.05) influenced the decay of MS2 at these sites. In this 
study, no notable decline in HAdV numbers (PCR detectable units) was observed in 
both biosolids-amended and the un-amended soils at all three sites. The HAdV 
decay time (T90 ≥ 180 days) in biosolids-amended and un-amended soils was 
significantly higher than MS2 (T90 = 22-108 days). The results of this study 
suggest that adenovirus could survive for a longer period of time (>180 days) 
during the winter in biosolids-amended soil. The stability of adenovirus 
suggests that consideration towards biosolids amendment frequency, time, rates 
and appropriate withholding periods are necessary for risk mitigation.

Bacteriophages are perceived to be good models for the study of airborne viruses 
because they are safe to use, some of them display structural features similar 
to those of human and animal viruses, and they are relatively easy to produce in 
large quantities. Yet, only a few studies have investigated them as models. It 
has previously been demonstrated that aerosolization, environmental conditions, 
and sampling conditions affect viral infectivity, but viral infectivity is virus 
dependent. Thus, several virus models are likely needed to study their general 
behavior in aerosols. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of 
aerosolization and sampling on the infectivity of five tail-less bacteriophages 
and two pathogenic viruses: MS2 (a single-stranded RNA [ssRNA] phage of the 
Leviviridae family), Φ6 (a segmented double-stranded RNA [dsRNA] phage of the 
Cystoviridae family), ΦX174 (a single-stranded DNA [ssDNA] phage of the 
Microviridae family), PM2 (a double-stranded DNA [dsDNA] phage of the 
Corticoviridae family), PR772 (a dsDNA phage of the Tectiviridae family), human 
influenza A virus H1N1 (an ssRNA virus of the Orthomyxoviridae family), and the 
poultry virus Newcastle disease virus (NDV; an ssRNA virus of the 
Paramyxoviridae family). Three nebulizers and two nebulization salt buffers 
(with or without organic fluid) were tested, as were two aerosol sampling 
devices, a liquid cyclone (SKC BioSampler) and a dry cyclone (National Institute 
for Occupational Safety and Health two-stage cyclone bioaerosol sampler). The 
presence of viruses in collected air samples was detected by culture and 
quantitative PCR (qPCR). Our results showed that these selected five phages 
behave differently when aerosolized and sampled. RNA phage MS2 and ssDNA phage 
ΦX174 were the most resistant to aerosolization and sampling. The presence of 
organic fluid in the nebulization buffer protected phages PR772 and Φ6 
throughout the aerosolization and sampling with dry cyclones. In this 
experimental setup, the behavior of the influenza virus resembled that of phages 
PR772 and Φ6, while the behavior of NDV was closer to that of phages MS2 and 
ΦX174. These results provide critical information for the selection of 
appropriate phage models to mimic the behavior of specific human and animal 
viruses in aerosols.

AIM: The aim of the study was to develop test methods and evaluate survival of 
Francisella philomiragia cells and MS2 bacteriophage after exposure to PES-Solid 
(a solid source of peracetic acid) formulations with or without surfactants.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Francisella philomiragia cells (≥7·6 log10 CFU) or MS2 
bacteriophage (≥6·8 log10 PFU) were deposited on seven different test materials 
and treated with three different PES-Solid formulations, three different 
preneutralized samples and filter controls at room temperature for 15 min. There 
were 0-1·3 log10 CFU (<20 cells) of cell survival, or 0-1·7 log10 (<51 PFU) of 
bacteriophage survival in all 21 test combinations (organism, formulation and 
substrate) containing reactive PES-Solid. In addition, the microemulsion 
(Dahlgren Surfactant System) showed ≤2 log10 (100 cells) of viable 
F. philomiragia cells, indicating the microemulsion achieved <2 log10 CFU on its 
own.
CONCLUSIONS: Three PES-Solid formulations and one microemulsion system (DSS) 
inactivated F. philomiragia cells and/or MS2 bacteriophage that were deposited 
on seven different materials.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: A test method was developed to show that 
reactive PES-Solid formulations and a microemulsion system (DSS) inactivated >6 
log10 CFU/PFU F. philomiragia cells and/or MS2 bacteriophage on different 
materials.

OBJECTIVE: This study compared the performance of two high-volume bioaerosol air 
samplers for viable virus to an accepted standard low-volume sampler. In typical 
bioaerosol emergency response scenarios, highvolume sampling is essential for 
the low infective concentrations and large air volumes involved.
DESIGN: Two high-volume air samplers (XMX/2LMIL and DFU-1000) were evaluated 
alongside a lowvolume sample (BioSampler). Low and high concentrations (9.3-93.2 
agent containing particles per liter of air [ACPLA]) of male-specific coliphage 
2 (MS2) virus were released into a 12 m3 aerosol test chamber and collected 
using the air samplers. The collection media from the samplers were then 
processed and viable virus was assessed via plaque assay.
SETTING: Aerosol test chamber.
SUBJECTS, PARTICIPANTS: None.
INTERVENTIONS: Collection media and flow rate were modified for the XMX/2L-MIL 
sampler for viable analysis.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Concentration estimates in units of plaque forming units 
per liter of air (PFU/liter) assessed by the samplers as compared to the levels 
inside the chamber as evaluated with a slit to agar plate in units of ACPLA. 
Comparison was made via one-way analysis of variance.
RESULTS: Both the XMX/2L-MIL and DFU-1000 achieved collection effectiveness 
equal to or greater than the low-volume air sampler for the evaluated MS2 
concentrations. The XMX/2L-MIL reliably collected quantifiable low 
concentrations of MS2, but the DFU-1000 was unable to do so.
CONCLUSIONS: For emergency response to suspected bioaerosols, the evaluated 
high-volume samplers are as effective as the standard low-flow sampler and 
should be considered in conducting a health risk assessment. If low 
concentrations are expected, then high-flow samplers using liquid collection are 
preferred.

University , Seoul , Republic of Korea.

The aim of this study was to investigate the adsorption of bacteriophage MS2 by 
magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in aqueous solutions. The characteristics of 
synthetic nanoparticles were analyzed using various techniques. The adsorption 
of MS2 to the nanoparticles was examined under various conditions using batch 
experiments. The results showed that the nanoparticles were mainly composed of 
maghemite along with goethite. The nanoparticles had a specific surface area of 
82.2 m(2) g(-1), with an average pore diameter of 13.2 nm and total pore volume 
of 0.2703 cm(3) g(-1). The results demonstrated that the removal of MS2 by the 
nanoparticles was very fast. A 3.15 log removal (99.93%) was achieved within 
60 min (adsorbent dose = 2 g L(-1); MS2 concentration = 2.94 × 10(6) pfu 
mL(-1)). The log removal decreased from 3.52 to 0.36 with increasing MS2 
concentration from 1.59 × 10(4) to 5.01 × 10(7) pfu mL(-1). Also, the effect of 
solution pH on MS2 removal was minimal at pH 4.2-8.4. The removal of MS2 
decreased in the presence of anions such as carbonate and phosphate, with the 
latter showing a greater hindrance effect on removal. This study demonstrated 
that magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles are very effective in the removal of MS2 
from aqueous solutions.

This study evaluated the role of physical and biological filter characteristics 
on the reduction of MS2 bacteriophage in biosand filters (BSFs). Three 
full-scale concrete Version 10 BSFs, each with a 55 cm sand media depth and a 12 
L charge volume, reached 4 log10 reduction of MS2 within 43 days of operation. A 
consistently high reduction of MS2 between 4 log10 and 7 log10 was demonstrated 
for up to 294 days. Further examining one of the filters revealed that an 
average of 2.8 log10 reduction of MS2 was achieved within the first 5 cm of the 
filter, and cumulative virus reduction reached an average of 5.6 log10 after 240 
days. Core sand samples from this filter were taken for protein, carbohydrate, 
and genomic extraction. Higher reduction of MS2 in the top 5 cm of the sand 
media (0.56 log10 reduction per cm vs 0.06 log10 reduction per cm for the rest 
of the filter depth) coincided with greater diversity of microbial communities 
and increased concentrations of carbohydrates. In the upper layers, "Candidatus 
Nitrosopumilus maritimus" and "Ca. Nitrospira defluvii" were found as dominant 
populations, while significant amounts of Thiobacillus-related OTUs were 
detected in the lower layers. Proteolytic bacterial populations such as the 
classes Sphingobacteria and Clostridia were observed over the entire filter 
depth. Thus, this study provides the first insight into microbial community 
structures that may play a role in MS2 reduction in BSF ecosystems. Overall, 
besides media ripening and physical reduction mechanisms such as filter depth 
and long residence time (45 min vs 24 ± 8.5 h), the establishment of 
chemolithotrophs and proteolytic bacteria could greatly enhance the reduction of 
MS2.

Increasing attention is being paid to the impact of agricultural activities on 
water quality to understand the impact on public health. F-RNA coliphages have 
been proposed as viral indicators of fecal contamination while porcine 
teschovirus (PTV) and porcine adenovirus (PAdV) are proposed indicators of fecal 
contamination of swine origin. Viruses and coliphages are present in water in 
very low concentrations and must be concentrated to permit their detection. 
There is little information comparing the effectiveness of the methods for 
concentrating F-RNA coliphages with concentration methods for other viruses and 
vice versa. The objective of this study was to compare 5 current published 
methods for recovering F-RNA coliphages, PTV and PAdV from river water samples 
concentrated by electronegative nitrocellulose membrane filters (methods A and 
B) or electropositive Zeta Plus 60S filters (methods C-E). Method A is used 
routinely for the detection of coliphages (Méndez et al., 2004) and method C 
(Brassard et al., 2005) is the official method in Health Canada's compendium for 
the detection of viruses in bottled mineral or spring water. When river water 
was inoculated with stocks of F-RNA MS2, PAdV, and PTV to final concentrations 
of 1×10(6) PFU/100 mL, 1×10(5) gc/100 mL and 3×10(5) gc/100 mL, respectively, a 
significantly higher recovery for each virus was consistently obtained for 
method A with recoveries of 52% for MS2, 95% for PAdV, and 1.5% for PTV. When 
method A was compared with method C for the detection of F-coliphages, PAdV and 
PTV in river water samples, viruses were detected with higher frequencies and at 
higher mean numbers with method A than with method C. With method A, 
F-coliphages were detected in 11/12 samples (5-154 PFU/100 mL), PTV in 12/12 
samples (397-10,951 gc/100 mL), PAdV in 1/12 samples (15 gc/100 mL), and F-RNA 
GIII in 1/12 samples (750 gc/100 mL) while F-RNA genotypes I, II, and IV were 
not detected by qRT-PCR.

A recombinant RNA bacteriophage system to identify functionally important 
nucleotides in a self-cleaving ribozyme.

BACKGROUND: RNA bacteriophages like Qbeta and MS2 are well known for their high 
mutation rate, short infection cycle and strong selection against foreign 
inserts. The hammerhead ribozyme (HHRz) is a small self-cleaving RNA molecule 
whose active residues have previously been identified by mutational analysis of 
each individual base. Here the functionally important bases of HHRz were 
determined in a single screening experiment by inserting the HHRz into the 
genome of MS2.
FINDINGS: The minimal HHRz of satellite Tobacco ringspot virus was cloned into 
the genome of RNA bacteriophage MS2. Sequence analysis of the surviving phages 
revealed that the majority had acquired single base-substitutions that 
apparently inactivated the HHRz. The positions of these substitutions exactly 
matched that of the previously determined core residues of the HHRz.
CONCLUSIONS: Natural selection against a ribozyme in the genome of MS2 can be 
used to quickly identify nucleotides required for self-cleavage.

Disinfection by low-pressure monochromatic ultraviolet (UVC) radiation (253.7 
nm) became an important technique to sanitize drinking water and also wastewater 
in tertiary treatments. In order to prevent the transmission of waterborne viral 
diseases, the analysis of the disinfection kinetics and the quantification of 
infectious viral pathogens and indicators are highly relevant and need to be 
addressed. The families Adenoviridae and Polyomaviridae comprise human and 
animal pathogenic viruses that have been also proposed as indicators of fecal 
contamination in water and as Microbial Source Tracking tools. While it has been 
previously suggested that dsDNA viruses may be highly resistant to UVC radiation 
compared to other viruses or bacteria, no information is available on the 
stability of polyomavirus toward UV irradiation. Here, the inactivation of dsDNA 
(HAdV2 and JCPyV) and ssRNA (MS2 bacteriophage) viruses was analyzed at 
increasing UVC fluences. A minor decay of 2-logs was achieved for both 
infectious JC polyomaviruses (JCPyV) and human adenoviruses 2 (HAdV2) exposed to 
a UVC fluence of 1,400 J/m(2), while a decay of 4-log was observed for MS2 
bacteriophages (ssRNA). The present study reveals the high UVC resistance of 
dsDNA viruses, and the UV fluences needed to efficiently inactivate JCPyV and 
HAdV2 are predicted. Furthermore, we show that in conjunction with appropriate 
mathematical models, qPCR data may be used to accurately estimate virus 
infectivity.

Rotavirus (RoV) and adenovirus (AdV) are important viral pathogens for the risk 
analysis of drinking water. Despite this, little is known about their retention 
and transport behaviors in porous media due to a lack of representative 
surrogates. We developed RoV and AdV surrogates by covalently coupling 70-nm 
sized silica nanoparticles with specific proteins and a DNA marker for sensitive 
detection. Filtration experiments using beach sand columns demonstrated the 
similarity of the surrogates' concentrations, filtration efficiencies and 
attachment kinetics to those of the target viruses. The surrogates showed the 
same magnitude of concentration reduction as the viruses. Conversely, MS2 phage 
(a traditional virus model) over-predicted concentrations of AdV and RoV by 1- 
and 2-orders of magnitude respectively. The surrogates remained stable in size, 
surface charge and DNA concentration for at least one year. They can be easily 
and rapidly detected down to a single particle. Preliminary tests suggest that 
they were readily detectable in a number of environmental waters and treated 
effluent. With up-scaling validation in pilot trials, the surrogates developed 
here could be a cost-effective new tool for studying virus retention and 
transport in porous media. Examples include assessing filter efficacy in water 
and wastewater treatment, tracking virus migration in groundwater after effluent 
land disposal, and establishing safe setback distances for groundwater 
protection.

Thrombosis is the cause of many cardiovascular syndromes and is a significant 
contributor to life-threatening diseases, such as myocardial infarction and 
stroke. Thrombus targeted imaging agents have the capability to provide 
molecular information about pathological clots, potentially improving detection, 
risk stratification, and therapy of thrombosis-related diseases. Nanocarriers 
are a promising platform for the development of molecular imaging agents as they 
can be modified to have external targeting ligands and internal functional 
cargo. In this work, we report the synthesis and use of chemically 
functionalized bacteriophage MS2 capsids as biomolecule-based nanoparticles for 
fibrin imaging. The capsids were modified using an oxidative coupling reaction, 
conjugating ∼90 copies of a fibrin targeting peptide to the exterior of each 
protein shell. The ability of the multivalent, targeted capsids to bind fibrin 
was first demonstrated by determining the impact on thrombin-mediated clot 
formation. The modified capsids out-performed the free peptides and were shown 
to inhibit clot formation at effective concentrations over ten-fold lower than 
the monomeric peptide alone. The installation of near-infrared fluorophores on 
the interior surface of the capsids enabled optical detection of binding to 
fibrin clots. The targeted capsids bound to fibrin, exhibiting higher 
signal-to-background than control, non-targeted MS2-based nanoagents. The in 
vitro assessment of the capsids suggests that fibrin-targeted MS2 capsids could 
be used as delivery agents to thrombi for diagnostic or therapeutic 
applications.

The effect of membrane fouling on the removal of enteric virus surrogates MS2 
and φX174 bacteriophage by an ultrafiltration membrane was assessed under 
simulated full-scale drinking water treatment operating conditions. Filtration 
experiments of up to 8 days using either river or lake water ascertained how the 
membrane fouling layer affected virus removal. Organic carbon fractionation 
techniques identified potential foulants, including biopolymers, in the feed 
water and in the permeate. Hydraulically irreversible fouling could greatly 
improve the removal of both viruses at moderate and severe fouling conditions by 
up to 2.5 logs. Hydraulically reversible fouling increased virus removal only 
slightly, and increased removal of >0.5 log for both phage were only obtained 
under severe fouling conditions. The increase in virus removal due to 
irreversible and reversible fouling differed between the two water sources. As 
the degree of fouling increased, differences between the removal of the two 
phage decreased. Maintenance cleaning partially removed membrane foulants, 
however virus removal following maintenance cleaning was lower than that of the 
fouled membrane, it remained higher than that of the clean membrane.

The trophic interactions between viruses, bacteria and protists play a crucial 
role in structuring microbial communities and regulating nutrient and organic 
matter flux. Here, we show that the impact on viral density by heterotrophic 
flagellates is related to their feeding behaviour (feeding on sedimented 
particles - Thaumatomonas coloniensis, filter feeding of suspended particles - 
Salpingoeca sp., and actively searching raptorial feeding - Goniomonas 
truncata). Phage MS2 was co-incubated with flagellates and the natural bacterial 
and viral community originating from the same groundwater habitats where the 
flagellates were isolated. Three complementary assays, i.e. flow cytometry, qPCR 
and plaque assay, were used for enumeration of total viruses, total MS2 phages, 
and free and infectious MS2, respectively, to provide insights into the grazing 
mechanisms of the flagellates on viruses. Phage MS2 was actively removed by the 
suspension feeders T. coloniensis and Salpingoeca sp. in contrast with the 
actively raptoriale grazer G. truncata. The decline of viral titre was 
demonstrated to be caused by ingestion rather than random absorption by both 
qPCR and locating protein fluorescently labelled MS2 inside the flagellates. 
Further, we indicate that phages can be used as a minor carbon source for 
flagellates. Collectively, these data demonstrate that eliminating viruses can 
be an important function of protists in microbial food webs, carbon cycling and 
potentially water quality control.

Tucson, AZ, 85721, USA.

The goals of this study were to observe the spread of viruses in a hotel setting 
and to assess the effectiveness of a hygiene intervention in reducing their 
spread. Selected fomites in one hotel room were inoculated with bacteriophage 
ϕx-174, and fomites in a conference center within the same hotel were inoculated 
using bacteriophage MS2. Cleaning of the contaminated room resulted in the 
spread of viruses to other rooms by the housekeeping staff. Furthermore, viruses 
were transferred by hotel guests to the conference center and a communal kitchen 
area. Additionally, conference attendees transferred viruses from the conference 
center to their hotel rooms and a communal kitchen area. This study demonstrated 
how viruses can be spread throughout a hotel setting by both housekeepers and 
guests. A hygiene intervention, which included providing hand hygiene products 
and facial tissues to the guests and disinfecting solutions with disposable 
wipes to the housekeeping staff, was successful in reducing the spread of 
viruses between the hotel guest rooms and conference center. The hygiene 
intervention resulted in significantly reduced transfer of the ϕx-174 between 
the contaminated hotel room and other hotel rooms, communal areas, and the 
conference center (p = 0.02).

Building plasmonic nanostructures using biomolecules as scaffolds has shown 
great potential for attaining tunable light absorption and emission via precise 
spatial organization of optical species and antennae. Here we report bottom-up 
assembly of hierarchical plasmonic nanostructures using DNA origami templates 
and MS2 virus capsids. These serve as programmable scaffolds that provide 
molecular level control over the distribution of fluorophores and 
nanometer-scale control over their distance from a gold nanoparticle antenna. 
While previous research using DNA origami to assemble plasmonic nanostructures 
focused on determining the distance-dependent response of single fluorophores, 
here we address the challenge of constructing hybrid nanostructures that present 
an organized ensemble of fluorophores and then investigate the plasmonic 
response. By combining finite-difference time-domain numerical simulations with 
atomic force microscopy and correlated scanning confocal fluorescence 
microscopy, we find that the use of the scaffold keeps the majority of the 
fluorophores out of the quenching zone, leading to increased fluorescence 
intensity and mild levels of enhancement. The results show that the degree of 
enhancement can be controlled by exploiting capsid scaffolds of different sizes 
and tuning capsid-AuNP distances. These bioinspired plasmonic nanostructures 
provide a flexible design for manipulating photonic excitation and 
photoemission.

To protect groundwater as a drinking water resource from microbiological 
contamination, protection zones are installed. While travelling through these 
zones, concentrations of potential pathogens should decline to levels that pose 
no risks to human health. Removal of viruses during subsurface passage is 
influenced by physicochemical conditions, such as oxygen concentration, which 
also affects virus survival. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of 
redox conditions on the removal of viruses during sand filtration. Experiments 
in glass columns filled with medium-grained sand were conducted to investigate 
virus removal in the presence and absence of dissolved oxygen. Bacteriophages 
MS2 and PhiX174, as surrogates for human enteric viruses were spiked in pulsed 
or in continuous mode and pumped through the columns at a filter velocity of 
about 1m/d. Virus breakthrough curves were analyzed by calculating total viral 
elimination and fitted using one-dimensional transport models (CXTFIT and 
HYDRUS-1D). While short-term experiments with pulsed virus application showed 
only small differences with regard to virus removal under oxic and anoxic 
conditions, a long-term experiment with continuous dosing revealed a clearly 
lower elimination of viruses under anoxic conditions. These findings suggest 
that less inactivation and less adsorption of viruses in anoxic environments 
affect their removal. Therefore, in risk assessment studies aimed to secure 
drinking water resources from viral contamination and optimization of protection 
zones, the oxic and anoxic conditions in the subsurface should also be 
considered.

Byproducts of tomato are known to include phenolic compounds but have not been 
studied in depth. In this study, the phenolic compositions of (stem, leaf, root, 
and whole plant) of two tomato cultivars, Pitenza and Floradade, were analyzed 
by HPLC-DAD. In parallel, the antiviral effects of crude extracts on viral 
surrogates, the bacteriophages MS2 and Av-05 were evaluated. The leaf extracts 
from the two varieties showed the highest concentration of phenolic compounds. 
The compounds identified were gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, ferulic acid, 
cafeic acid, rutin, and quercetin, and they represented 3174.3 and 1057.9 mg/100 
g dried weight of the Pitenza and Floradade cultivars, respectively. MS2 and 
Av-05 titers at 5 mg/mL were reduced by 3.47 and 5.78 log10 PFU/mL and 3.78 and 
4.93 log10 PFU/mL by Pitenza and Floradade cultivar leaf extract, respectively. 
These results show that tomato extracts are natural sources of bioactive 
substances with antiviral activity.

RT-qPCR, an established method for the detection of RNA viruses, requires 
internal RNA controls for the correct interpretation of PCR results. Robust and 
versatile RT-PCR controls can be achieved for example by packaging RNA into a 
virus-derived protein shell. In this study a MS2-based internal control system 
was developed, that allows stable and universal packing of different RNAs into 
non-infectious, non-lytic MS2-based viral like particles (VLPs). Two competitive 
internal controls for a hantavirus assay and a Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever 
Virus (CCHFV) assay were cloned for the expression of VLPs. The expression of 
VLPs containing the RNA of interest could be induced with arabinose in 
Escherichia coli. The VLPs proved to be temperature resistant and could be 
frozen and thawed several times without degradation. Distinction of IC RNA from 
the target RNA was facilitated by a clear shift in the melting temperature or by 
specific hybridization signals. Furthermore, target and IC PCR amplification 
could be easily distinguished by their size in gel-electrophoretic analyses. 
Limits of detection were determined, demonstrating that the application of the 
IC did not reduce the sensitivity of the target RT-qPCR reactions. The system 
can be adapted to nearly any required sequence, resulting in a highly flexible 
method with broad range applications.

The most popular strategy for normalization of RT-qPCR data involves presenting 
them in comparison with expression of "housekeeping" genes. However, the 
required stable expression of the control genes is not always achievable. As an 
alternative, we used ribonucleoprotein phage particles as an exogenous internal 
control and demonstrated that this type of normalization provides a simple and 
reliable method for quantification in RT-qPCR experiments. Using phage-based 
normalization, we analyzed mRNA levels of three popular housekeeping genes 
coding β-actin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and ribosomal protein 
L30 and showed high variability in their expression patterns during rat brain 
development, indicating that they should not be used as controls in gene 
expression studies of the developing brain either individually or in 
combination. Using phage-based controls, we showed interstrain differences and 
age-related changes in the expression of genes involved in proteoglycan 
biosynthesis and degradation in developing brain of senescence-accelerated OXYS 
rats and control Wistar rats.

Building polyhedra by self-assembly: theory and experiment.

We investigate the utility of a mathematical framework based on discrete 
geometry to model biological and synthetic self-assembly. Our primary biological 
example is the self-assembly of icosahedral viruses; our synthetic example is 
surface-tension-driven self-folding polyhedra. In both instances, the process of 
self-assembly is modeled by decomposing the polyhedron into a set of partially 
formed intermediate states. The set of all intermediates is called the 
configuration space, pathways of assembly are modeled as paths in the 
configuration space, and the kinetics and yield of assembly are modeled by rate 
equations, Markov chains, or cost functions on the configuration space. We 
review an interesting interplay between biological function and mathematical 
structure in viruses in light of this framework. We discuss in particular: (i) 
tiling theory as a coarse-grained description of all-atom models; (ii) the 
building game-a growth model for the formation of polyhedra; and (iii) the 
application of these models to the self-assembly of the bacteriophage MS2. We 
then use a similar framework to model self-folding polyhedra. We use a discrete 
folding algorithm to compute a configuration space that idealizes 
surface-tension-driven self-folding and analyze pathways of assembly and 
dominant intermediates. These computations are then compared with experimental 
observations of a self-folding dodecahedron with side 300 μm. In both models, 
despite a combinatorial explosion in the size of the configuration space, a few 
pathways and intermediates dominate self-assembly. For self-folding polyhedra, 
the dominant intermediates have fewer degrees of freedom than comparable 
intermediates, and are thus more rigid. The concentration of assembly pathways 
on a few intermediates with distinguished geometric properties is biologically 
and physically important, and suggests deeper mathematical structure.

In this study, SiO2 nanoparticles surface coated with Ag nanoparticles (SA 
particles) were fabricated to coat a medium air filter. The pressure drop, 
filtration efficiency, and anti-viral ability of the filter were evaluated 
against aerosolized bacteriophage MS2 in a continuous air flow condition. A 
mathematical approach was developed to measure the anti-viral ability of the 
filter with various virus deposition times. Moreover, two quality factors based 
on the anti-viral ability of the filter, and a traditional quality factor based 
on filtration efficiency, were calculated. The filtration efficiency and 
pressure drop increased with decreasing media velocity and with increasing SA 
particle coating level. The anti-viral efficiency also increased with increasing 
SA particle coating level, and decreased by with increasing virus deposition 
time. Consequently, SA particle coating on a filter does not have significant 
effects on filtration quality, and there is an optimal coating level to produce 
the highest anti-viral quality.

This work presents a validated optical fluence rate model optimised for 
ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (UV-LEDs), which allow a very wide range of 
emission wavelengths and source geometries to be used in water treatment units. 
The model is based on a Monte Carlo approach, in which an incremental 
ray-tracing algorithm is used to calculate the local volumetric rate of energy 
absorption and subsequently convert it to the local fluence rate distribution 
for an UV-LED water treatment chamber of arbitrary design. The model includes 
contributions from optical reflections and scattering by treatment chamber walls 
and from scattering due to particulates and/or microorganisms. The model 
successfully predicts optical fluence rates in point-of-use water treatment 
units, as verified using biodosimetry with MS-2 bacteriophage at a UV-LED 
emission wavelength of 254 nm. The effects of chamber geometry are also modelled 
effectively and are consistent with the inactivation data for E. coli at 254 nm. 
The data indicate that this model is suitable for application in the design and 
optimisation of UV-LED-based water treatment systems.

The influenza virus has received extensive attention due to the recent H1N1 
pandemics originating from swine. This study reports a label-free, highly 
sensitive, and selective electrical immunosensor for the detection of influenza 
virus H1N1 based on dielectrophoretically deposited single-walled carbon 
nanotubes (SWCNTs). COOH-functionalized SWCNTs were deposited on a 
self-assembled monolayer of polyelectrolyte polydiallyldimethyl-ammonium 
chloride (PDDA) between two gold electrodes by dielectrophoretic and 
electrostatic forces, which resulted in reproducible, uniform, aligned, and 
aggregation-free SWCNT channels (2-10 μm in length). Avidin was immobilized onto 
the PDDA-SWCNT channels, and viral antibodies were immobilized using 
biotin-avidin coupling. The resistance of the channels increased with the 
binding of the influenza viruses to the antibodies. These immunosensors showed 
linear behavior as the virus concentration was varied from 1 to 10(4) PFU ml(-1) 
along with a detection time of 30 min. The immunosensors with a 2 μm channel 
length detected 1 PFU ml(-1) of the influenza virus accurately (R(2) = 0.99) and 
selectively from MS2 bacteriophages. These immunosensors have the potential to 
become an important component of a point-of-care test kit that will enable a 
rapid clinical diagnosis.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of recently identified untranslated 
RNA molecules that have been shown to function in diverse cellular processes. 
The purification and analysis of lncRNA-protein (lncRNP) complexes is critical 
toward understanding the normal physiological function of these molecules. Here, 
we describe the purification of lncRNP complexes from human cells using a 
FLAG-tagged MS2-phage coat protein (MS2 CP) that binds in sequence-specific 
fashion to MS2-phage coat protein-binding sites (MS2bs) with high affinity. In 
these experiments, a FLAG-tagged MS2 CP is transiently co-expressed with a 
version of the lncRNA into which 12 copies of the MS2bs have been inserted near 
its 3'-end. The lncRNA-FLAG-tagged MS2 CP complex is then isolated using an 
anti-FLAG antibody, allowing for characterization of associated cellular 
proteins and RNAs.

MS2, Phi X 174 and PRD1 bacteriophages are commonly used as surrogates to 
evaluate pathogenic virus behavior in natural aquatic media. The interfacial 
properties of these model soft bioparticles are herein discussed in connection 
with their propensities to adhere onto abiotic surfaces that differ in terms of 
surface charges and hydrophobicities. The phages considered in this work exhibit 
distinct multilayered surface structures and their electrostatic charges are 
evaluated from the dependence of their electrophoretic mobilities on electrolyte 
concentration at neutral pH on the basis of electrokinetic theory for soft 
(bio)particles. The charges of the viruses probed by electrokinetics vary 
according to the sequence Phi X 174⩽PRD1≪MS2, where '<' stands for 'less charged 
than'. The hydrophobic/hydrophilic balances of the phages are further derived 
from their adhesions onto model hydrophobic and hydrophilic self-assembled 
mono-layers. The corresponding results lead to the following hydrophobicity 
sequence Phi X 174≪MS2<PRD1 where '<' means 'less hydrophobic than'. The 
respective electrostatic and hydrophobic/hydrophilic features of the phages are 
further shown to be consistent with their measured adhesions onto 
polyethersulfone-based membranes with distinct hydrophobicities and charge 
levels. The methodology clearly demonstrates that the traditionally adopted 
phage isoelectric point as a relevant physicochemical descriptor for phage 
adhesion is not adequate for MS2, Phi X 174 and PRD1 bacteriophages.

The trafficking and asymmetric distribution of cytoplasmic RNA is a fundamental 
process during development and signaling across phyla. Plants support the 
intercellular trafficking of RNA molecules such as gene transcripts, small RNAs, 
and viral RNA genomes by targeting these RNA molecules to plasmodesmata (PD). 
Intercellular transport of RNA molecules through PD has fundamental implications 
in the cell-to-cell and systemic signaling during plant development and in the 
systemic spread of viral disease. Recent advances in time-lapse microscopy allow 
researchers to approach dynamic biological processes at the molecular level in 
living cells and tissues. These advances include the ability to label RNA 
molecules in vivo and thus to monitor their distribution and trafficking. In a 
broadly used RNA labeling approach, the MS2 method, the RNA of interest is 
tagged with a specific stem-loop (SL) RNA sequence derived from the origin of 
assembly region of the bacteriophage MS2 genome that binds to the bacteriophage 
coat protein (CP) and which, if fused to a fluorescent protein, allows the 
visualization of the tagged RNA by fluorescence microscopy. Here we describe a 
protocol for the in vivo visualization of transiently expressed SL-tagged RNA 
and discuss key aspects to study RNA localization and trafficking to and through 
plasmodesmata in Nicotiana benthamiana plants.

The use of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as building blocks in the design of 
electrochemical biosensors has been attracting attention over the last few 
years, mainly due to their high electrical conductivity and large surface area. 
Here, we present two approaches based on tailored single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) 
architectures to develop immunosensors for the bacteriophage MS2, a virus often 
detected in sewage-impacted water supplies. In the first approach, SWCNTs were 
used in the bottom-up design of sensors as antibody immobilization support. 
Carboxy-functionalised SWCNTs were covalently tethered onto gold electrodes via 
carbodiimide coupling to cysteamine-modified gold electrodes. These SWCNTs were 
hydrazide functionalized by electrochemical grafting of diazonium salts. 
Site-oriented immobilization of antibodies was then carried out through 
hydrazone bond formation. Results showed microarray electrode behavior, greatly 
improving the signal-to-noise ratio. Excellent sensitivity and limit of 
detection (9.3 pfu/mL and 9.8 pfu/mL in buffer and in river water, respectively) 
were achieved, due to the combination of the SWCNTs' ability to promote electron 
transfer reactions with electroactive species at low overpotentials and their 
high surface-to-volume ratio providing a favorable environment to immobilize 
biomolecules. In the second approach, SWCNTs were decorated with iron oxide 
nanoparticles. Diazonium salts were electrochemically grafted on 
iron-oxide-nanoparticle-decorated SWCNTs to functionalize them with hydrazide 
groups that facilitate site-directed immobilization of antibodies via hydrazone 
coupling. These magnetic immunocarriers facilitated MS2 separation and 
concentration on an electrode surface. This approach minimized non-specific 
adsorptions and matrix effects and allowed low limits of detection (12 pfu/mL 
and 39 pfu/mL in buffer and in river water, respectively) that could be further 
decreased by incubating the magnetic immunocarriers with larger volumes of 
sample. Significantly, both approaches permitted the detection of MS2 to levels 
regularly encountered in sewage-impacted environments.

[Effects of algae and kaolinite particles on the survival of bacteriophage MS2].

[Article in Chinese]

He Q, Wu QQ, Ma HF, Zhou ZM, Yuan BL.

In this study, Bacteriophage MS2, Kaolinite and Microcystis aeruginosa were 
selected as model materials for human enteric viruses, inorganic and organic 
particles, respectively. The influence of the inorganic (Kaolinite) or organic 
(Microcystis aeruginosa) particles on the survival of MS2 at different 
conditions, such as particles concentration, pH, ion concentration and natural 
organic matter (NOM) were studied. The results showed that Kaolinite had no 
effect on the survival of phage MS2 except that apparent survival of MS2 
increased 1 logarithm in higher hardness water. Microcystis aeruginosa addition 
reduced 1 logarithm of MS2 survival. However, when the pH value was greater than 
4.0 or the concentration of Microcystis aeruginosa was less than 1.0 x 10(6) 
cells x L(-1), Microcystis aeruginosa addition had no influence on the survival 
of MS2. In higher hardness water, Microcystis aeruginosa protected MS2 viruses 
and then increased the survival of MS2. In drinking water, resource containing 
higher concentration of particles, the survival ability of virus would be 
enhanced with the increase of the hardness and then elevated the risks of 
drinking water safety.

Adsorption of Rotavirus, MS2 Bacteriophage and Surface-Modified Silica 
Nanoparticles to Hydrophobic Matter.

Adsorption to aquifer media is an important process in the removal of viruses 
from groundwater. Even though hydrophobic interactions have been shown to 
contribute to adsorption, little is known about the hydrophobicity of viruses 
found in groundwater. In this study, the hydrophobicity of rotavirus, MS2 
bacteriophage and DNA-labelled silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) coated with 
glycoprotein, protein A and alpha-1-microglobulin/bikunin precursor (AMBP) was 
investigated. The hydrophobicity was experimentally determined by using a 
modified microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons (MATH) assay. The results were 
compared with the theoretical hydrophobicity of the viral capsid proteins and 
the proteins used to coat the nanoparticles, and with the results of adsorption 
tests with unmodified and organosilane-coated (hydrophobic) silica sand. While 
most theoretical protein hydrophobicity values were similar, the results of the 
MATH assay suggested fundamental differences in the hydrophobicity of the 
viruses and the SiNPs. MS2 was found to be highly hydrophobic as based on the 
MATH hydrophobicity and a significantly enhanced adsorption to hydrophobic sand, 
whereas rotavirus was relatively hydrophilic. The MATH assay revealed that 
protein-coating of SiNP introduced some degree of hydrophobicity to hydrophilic 
SiNPs, enabling them to more closely mimic viral hydrophobicity. Our study also 
demonstrated that the protein-coated SiNPs better mimicked rotavirus adsorption 
to sand media (coated or not coated with hydrophobic organic matter) than the 
MS2. This further supports previous findings that these surface-modified SiNPs 
are useful surrogates in mimicking rotavirus retention and transport in porous 
media.

Legionnaires' disease can result when droplets or aerosols containing legionella 
bacteria are inhaled and deposited in the lungs. A number of outbreaks have been 
associated with the use of a spa pool where aeration, a high water temperature, 
and a large and variable organic load make disinfectant levels difficult to 
maintain. Spa pool ownership is increasing, and the aim of this study, using two 
surrogate organisms (MS-2 coliphage and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [a natural 
contaminant]), was to assess the potential risk to domestic users when 
disinfection fails. A representative "entry level" domestic spa pool was 
installed in an outdoor courtyard. The manufacturer's instructions for spa pool 
maintenance were not followed. A cyclone sampler was used to sample the aerosols 
released from the spa pool with and without activation of the air injection 
system. Samples were taken at increasing heights and distances from the pool. An 
aerodynamic particle sizer was used to measure the water droplet size 
distribution at each sample point. When the air injection system was 
inactivated, neither surrogate organism was recovered from the air. On 
activation of the air injection system, the mean mass of droplets within the 
respirable range (10 cm above the water line) was 36.8 μg cm(-3). This 
corresponded to a mean air concentration of P. aeruginosa of 350 CFU m(-3). From 
extrapolation from animal data, the estimated risk of infection from aerosols 
contaminated with similar concentrations of Legionella pneumophila was 0.76 
(males) and 0.65 (females). At 1 m above and/or beyond the pool, the mean 
aerosol mass decreased to 0.04 μg cm(-3) and corresponded to a 100-fold 
reduction in mean microbial air concentration. The estimated risk of infection 
at this distance was negligible.

Test protocols have been developed by the United States Environmental Protection 
Agency (USEPA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to test water treatment 
devices/systems that are used at the individual and home levels to ensure the 
removal of waterborne viruses. The goal of this study was to assess if coliphage 
surrogates could be used in this testing in place of the currently required use 
of animal or human enteric viruses. Five different coliphages (MS-2, PRD1, 
ΦX-174, Qβ, and fr) were compared to the removal of poliovirus type 1 (LSc-2ab) 
by eight different water treatment devices/systems using a general case and a 
challenge case (high organic load, dissolved solids, and turbidity) test water 
as defined by the USEPA. The performance of the units was rated as a pass/fail 
based on a 4 log removal/inactivation of the viruses. In all cases, a failure or 
a pass of the units/system for poliovirus also corresponded to a pass/fail by 
all of the coliphages. In summary, in using pass/fail criteria as recommended 
under USEPA guidelines for testing water treatment device/systems, the use of 
coliphages should be considered as an alternative to reduce cost and time of 
testing such devices/systems.

Relative insignificance of virus inactivation during aluminum electrocoagulation 
of saline waters.

Combined removal and inactivation of the MS2 bacteriophage from model saline 
(0-100 mM NaCl) waters by electrochemical treatment using a sacrificial aluminum 
anode was evaluated. Both chemical and electrodissolution contributed to 
coagulant dosing since measured aluminum concentrations were statistically 
higher than purely electrochemical predictions using Faraday's law. 
Electrocoagulation generated only small amounts of free chlorine in situ but 
effectively destabilized viruses and incorporated them into Al(OH)3(s) flocs 
during electrolysis. Low chlorine concentrations combined with virus shielding 
and aggregation within flocs resulted in very slow disinfection rates 
necessitating extended flocculation/contact times to achieve significant 
log-inactivation. Therefore, the dominant virus control mechanism during 
aluminum electrocoagulation of saline waters is "physical" removal by uptake 
onto flocs rather than "chemical" inactivation by chlorine. Attenuated total 
reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy provided evidence for 
oxidative transformations of capsid proteins including formation of oxyacids, 
aldehydes, and ketones. Electrocoagulation significantly altered protein 
secondary structures decreasing peak areas associated with turns, bends, 
α-helices, β-structures, and random coils for inactivated viruses compared with 
the MS2 stock. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction 
(qRT-PCR) measurements showed rapid initial RNA damage following a similar trend 
as plaque assay measurements of infectious viruses. However, ssRNA cleavage 
measured by qRT-PCR underestimated inactivation over longer durations. Although 
aluminum electrocoagulation of saline waters disorders virus capsids and damages 
RNA, inactivation occurs at a sufficiently low rate so as to only play a 
secondary role to floc-encapsulation during residence times typical of 
electrochemical treatment.

In this study, airborne MS2 bacteriophages were exposed for subsecond time 
intervals to atmospheric-pressure cold plasma (APCP) produced using different 
power levels (20, 24, and 28 W) and gas carriers (ambient air, Ar-O2 [2%, 
vol/vol], and He-O2 [2%, vol/vol]). In addition, waterborne MS2 viruses were 
directly subjected to the APCP treatment for up to 3 min. MS2 viruses with and 
without the APCP exposure were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), 
reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide 
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Viral inactivation was shown to exhibit linear 
relationships with the APCP generation power and exposure time (R(2) > 0.95 for 
all energy levels tested) up to 95% inactivation (1.3-log reduction) after a 
subsecond airborne exposure at 28 W; about the same inactivation level was 
achieved for waterborne viruses with an exposure time of less than 1 min. A 
larger amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as atomic oxygen, in APCP 
was detected for a higher generation power with Ar-O2 and He-O2 gas carriers. 
SEM images, SDS-PAGE, and agarose gel analysis of exposed waterborne viruses 
showed various levels of damage to both surface proteins and their related RNA 
genes after the APCP exposure, thus leading to the loss of their viability and 
infectivity.

Sunlight inactivates waterborne viruses via direct (absorption of sunlight by 
the virus) and indirect processes (adsorption of sunlight by external 
chromophores, which subsequently generate reactive species). While the 
mechanisms underlying these processes are understood, their relative importance 
remains unclear. This study establishes an experimental framework to determine 
the kinetic parameters associated with a virus' susceptibility to solar 
disinfection and proposes a model to estimate disinfection rates and to 
apportion the contributions of different inactivation processes. Quantum yields 
of direct inactivation were determined for three viruses (MS2, phiX174, and 
adenovirus), and second-order rate constants associated with indirect 
inactivation by four reactive species ((1)O2, OH(•), CO3(•-), and triplet 
states) were established. PhiX174 exhibited the greatest quantum yield (1.4 × 
10(-2)), indicating that it is more susceptible to direct inactivation than MS2 
(2.9 × 10(-3)) or adenovirus (2.5 × 10(-4)). Second-order rate constants ranged 
from 1.7 × 10(7) to 7.0 × 10(9) M(-1) s(-1) and followed the sequence MS2 > 
adenovirus > phiX174. A predictive model based on these parameters accurately 
estimated solar disinfection of MS2 and phiX174 in a natural water sample and 
approximated that of adenovirus within a factor of 6. Inactivation mostly 
occurred by direct processes, though indirect inactivation by (1)O2 also 
contributed to the disinfection of MS2 and adenovirus.

Adsorption on colloidal particles is one of the environmental processes 
affecting fate, transport, viability or reproducibility of viruses. This work 
studied colloidal interactions (adsorption kinetics and isotherms) between 
different oxide nanoparticles (NPs) (i.e., TiO2, NiO, ZnO, SiO2, and Al2O3) and 
bacteriophage, MS2. The results shows that that all oxide NPs exhibited strong 
adsorption capacity for MS2, except SiO2 NPs, which is supported by the extended 
Derjaguin and Landau, Verwey and Overbeek (EDLVO) theory. Moreover, the 
implication of such colloidal interactions on water disinfection is manifested 
by the observations that the presence of TiO2 and ZnO NPs could enhance MS2 
inactivation under solar irradiation, whereas NiO and SiO2 decreased MS2 
inactivation. By contrast, all of these oxide NPs were found to mitigate 
chlorine disinfection against MS2 to different extent, and the shielding effect 
was probably caused by reduced free chlorine and free MS2 in the solution due to 
sorption onto NPs. Clearly, there is a pressing need to further understand 
colloidal interactions between engineered NPs and viruses in water to better 
improve the current water treatment processes and to develop novel nanomaterials 
for water disinfection.

Immunity against viruses and plasmids provided by CRISPR-Cas systems relies on a 
ribonucleoprotein effector complex that triggers the degradation of invasive 
nucleic acids (NA). Effector complexes of type I (Cascade) and II (Cas9-dual 
RNA) target foreign DNA. Intriguingly, the genetic evidence suggests that the 
type III-A Csm complex targets DNA, whereas biochemical data show that the type 
III-B Cmr complex cleaves RNA. Here we aimed to investigate NA specificity and 
mechanism of CRISPR interference for the Streptococcus thermophilus Csm (III-A) 
complex (StCsm). When expressed in Escherichia coli, two complexes of different 
stoichiometry copurified with 40 and 72 nt crRNA species, respectively. Both 
complexes targeted RNA and generated multiple cuts at 6 nt intervals. The Csm3 
protein, present in multiple copies in both Csm complexes, acts as 
endoribonuclease. In the heterologous E. coli host, StCsm restricts MS2 RNA 
phage in a Csm3 nuclease-dependent manner. Thus, our results demonstrate that 
the type III-A StCsm complex guided by crRNA targets RNA and not DNA.

Suspended clay particles in groundwater can play a significant role as carriers 
of viruses, because, depending on the physicochemical conditions, clay particles 
may facilitate or hinder the mobility of viruses. This experimental study 
examines the effects of clay colloids on the transport of viruses in variably 
saturated porous media. All cotransport experiments were conducted in both 
saturated and partially saturated columns packed with glass beads, using 
bacteriophages MS2 and ΦX174 as model viruses, and kaolinite (KGa-1b) and 
montmorillonite (STx-1b) as model clay colloids. The various experimental 
collision efficiencies were determined using the classical colloid filtration 
theory. The experimental data indicated that the mass recovery of viruses and 
clay colloids decreased as the water saturation decreased. Temporal moments of 
the various breakthrough concentrations collected, suggested that the presence 
of clays significantly influenced virus transport and irreversible deposition 
onto glass beads. The mass recovery of both viruses, based on total effluent 
virus concentrations, was shown to reduce in the presence of suspended clay 
particles. Furthermore, the transport of suspended virus and clay-virus 
particles was retarded, compared to the conservative tracer. Under unsaturated 
conditions both clay particles facilitated the transport of ΦX174, while 
hindered the transport of MS2. Moreover, the surface properties of viruses, 
clays and glass beads were employed for the construction of classical DLVO and 
capillary potential energy profiles, and the results suggested that capillary 
forces play a significant role on colloid retention. It was estimated that the 
capillary potential energy of MS2 is lower than that of ΦX174, and the capillary 
potential energy of KGa-1b is lower than that of STx-1b, assuming that the 
protrusion distance through the water film is the same for each pair of 
particles. Moreover, the capillary potential energy is several orders of 
magnitude greater than the DLVO potential energy.

Virus Sensitivity Index of UV disinfection.

Tang WZ(1), Sillanpää M.

Author information:
(1)a Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering , Florida International 
University , 10555 West Flagler Street, Miami 33174 , FL , USA.

A new concept of Virus Sensitivity Index (VSI) is defined as the ratio between 
the first-order inactivation rate constant of a virus, ki, and that of MS2-phage 
during UV disinfection, kr. MS2-phage is chosen as the reference virus because 
it is recommended as a virus indicator during UV reactor design and validation 
by the US Environmental Protection Agency. VSI has wide applications in 
research, design, and validation of UV disinfection systems. For example, it can 
be used to rank the UV disinfection sensitivity of viruses in reference to 
MS2-phage. There are four major steps in deriving the equation between Hi/Hr and 
1/VSI. First, the first-order inactivation rate constants are determined by 
regression analysis between Log I and fluence required. Second, the inactivation 
rate constants of MS2-phage are statistically analysed at 3, 4, 5, and 6 Log I 
levels. Third, different VSI values are obtained from the ki of different 
viruses dividing by the kr of MS2-phage. Fourth, correlation between Hi/Hr and 
1/VSI is analysed by using linear, quadratic, and cubic models. As expected from 
the theoretical analysis, a linear relationship adequately correlates Hi/Hr and 
1/VSI without an intercept. VSI is used to quantitatively predict the UV fluence 
required for any virus at any log inactivation (Log I). Four equations were 
developed at 3, 4, 5, and 6 Log I. These equations have been validated using 
external data which are not used for the virus development. At Log I less than 
3, the equation tends to under-predict the required fluence at both low Log I 
such as 1 and 2 Log I. At Log I greater than 3 Log I, the equation tends to 
over-predict the fluence required. The reasons for these may very likely be due 
to the shoulder at the beginning and the tailing at the end of the collimated 
beam test experiments. At 3 Log I, the error percentage is less than 6%. The VSI 
is also used to predict inactivation rate constants under two different UV 
disinfection scenarios such as under sunlight and different virus aggregates. 
The correlation analysis shows that viruses will be about 40% more sensitive to 
sunlight than to UV254. On the other hand, virus size of 500 nm will reduce 
their VSI by 10%. This is the first attempt to use VSI to predict the required 
fluence at any given Log I. The equation can be used to quantitatively evaluate 
other parameters influencing UV disinfection. These factors include 
environmental species, antibiotic-resistant bacteria or genes, photo and dark 
repair, water quality such as suspended solids, and UV transmittance.

Ammonia as an in situ sanitizer: inactivation kinetics and mechanisms of the 
ssRNA virus MS2 by NH3.

Decrey L, Kazama S, Udert KM, Kohn T.

Sanitizing human and animal waste (e.g., urine, fecal sludge, or grey water) is 
a critical step in reducing the spread of disease and ensuring microbially safe 
reuse of waste materials. Viruses are particularly persistent pathogens and can 
be transmitted through inadequately sanitized waste. However, adequate storage 
or digestion of waste can strongly reduce the number of viruses due to increases 
in pH and uncharged aqueous ammonia (NH3), a known biocide. In this study we 
investigated the kinetics and mechanisms of inactivation of the single-stranded 
RNA virus MS2 under temperature, pH and NH3 conditions representative of waste 
storage. MS2 inactivation was mainly controlled by the activity of NH3 over a pH 
range of 7.0–9.5 and temperatures lower than 40 °C. Other bases (e.g., 
hydroxide, carbonate) additionally contributed to the observed reduction of 
infective MS2. The loss in MS2 infectivity could be rationalized by a loss in 
genome integrity, which was attributed to genome cleavage via alkaline 
transesterification. The contribution of each base to genome 
transesterification, and hence inactivation, could be related to the base pKa by 
means of a Bronsted relationship. The Bronsted relationship in conjunction with 
the activity of bases in solution enabled an accurate prediction of MS2 
inactivation rates.

Ultraviolet (UV) reactors used for disinfecting water and wastewater must be 
validated and monitored over time. The validation process requires understanding 
the photochemical properties of the pathogens of concern and the challenge 
microorganisms used to represent them. Specifically for polychromatic UV 
systems, the organisms' dose responses to UV light and their sensitivity across 
the UV spectrum must be known. This research measured the UV spectral 
sensitivity, called action spectra, of Cryptosporidium parvum, and MS2, T1UV, Q 
Beta, T7, and T7m Coliphages, as well as Bacillus pumilus spores. A tunable 
laser from the National Institute of Standards and Technology was used to 
isolate single UV wavelengths at 10 nm intervals between 210 and 290 nm. Above 
240 nm, all bacteria and viruses tested exhibited a relative peak sensitivity 
between 260 and 270 nm. Of the coliphage, MS2 exhibited the highest relative 
sensitivity below 240 nm, relative to its sensitivity at 254 nm, followed by Q 
Beta, T1UV, T7m and T7 coliphage. B. pumilus spores were more sensitive to UV 
light at 220 nm than any of the coliphage. These spectra are required for 
calculating action spectra correction factors for medium pressure UV system 
validation, for matching appropriate challenge microorganisms to pathogens, and 
for improving UV dose monitoring. Additionally, understanding the dose response 
of these organisms at multiple wavelengths can improve polychromatic UV dose 
calculations and enable prediction of pathogen inactivation from 
wavelength-specific disinfection technologies such as UV light emitting diodes 
(LEDs).

MS2 bacteriophage is the most commonly used surrogate for pathogenic viruses in 
laboratory and field studies. In order to determine the number of infectious 
viral particles in samples, the use of accurate quantitation methods is 
essential. We have optimised a size exclusion chromatography-based method for 
MS2 purification and a SYBR Green-based single-step quantitative reverse 
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay for the quantitation of 
MS2. The qRT-PCR enabled accurate quantitation of viral RNA of the purified 
stock with a detection limit of 2 genome copy equivalents/μl. Detection 
inhibition, if any, was eliminated by reducing sample volume added to the 
qRT-PCR reaction mix when MS2 was detected in environmental water samples. The 
purification method eliminated the impurities and the purified stock yielded a 
high concentration of infectious MS2 particles. The qRT-PCR assay enabled the 
accurate quantitation of the viral particles thus providing an alternative to 
the traditional plaque assays. A combined use of purified MS2 stock and 
PCR-based quantitation gives the opportunity to explore virus characteristics, 
behaviour and interactions in the environment.

We demonstrated a lateral flow immunoassay (LFA) for detection of viruses using 
fluorescently labeled M13 bacteriophage as reporters and single-reporter 
counting as the readout. AviTag-biotinylated M13 phage were functionalized with 
antibodies using avidin-biotin conjugation and fluorescently labeled with 
AlexaFluor 555. Individual phage bound to target viruses (here MS2 as a model) 
captured on an LFA membrane strip were imaged using epi-fluorescence microscopy. 
Using automated image processing, we counted the number of bound phage in 
micrographs as a function of target concentration. The resultant assay was more 
sensitive than enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and traditional colloidal-gold 
nanoparticle LFAs for direct detection of viruses.

Magnetic Fe3O4/graphene composite (abbreviated as G-Fe3O4) was synthesized 
successfully by solvothermal method to effectively remove both bacteriophage and 
bacteria in water, which was tested by HRTEM, XRD, BET, XPS, FTIR, CV, magnetic 
property and zeta-potential measurements. Based on the result of HRTEM, the 
single-sheet structure of graphene oxide and the monodisperse Fe3O4 
nanoparticles on the surface of graphene can be observed obviously. The G-Fe3O4 
composite were attractive for removing a wide range of pathogens including not 
only bacteriophage ms2, but also various bacteria such as S. aureus, E. coli, 
Salmonella, E. Faecium, E. faecalis, and Shigella. The removal efficiency of E. 
coli for G-Fe3O4 composite can achieve 93.09%, whereas it is only 54.97% with 
pure Fe3O4 nanoparticles. Moreover, a detailed verification test of real water 
samples was conducted and the removal efficiency of bacteria in real water 
samples with G-Fe3O4 composite can also reach 94.8%.

Street, London, WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom.

In a wide range of organisms the kinetics of transcription have been found to be 
noisy, with "bursts" or "pulses" of transcription interspersed with irregular 
periods of inactivity. The in vivo analysis of transcription dynamics can be 
most directly monitored using RNA stem loop motifs derived from MS2 and other 
bacteriophages. Here we describe the implementation of the MS2 RNA detection 
system and the steps required for precise measurement of transcription dynamics 
in highly motile cells. Automated image processing techniques are used to track 
large numbers of cells and measure transcription in a systematic and unbiased 
manner. We discuss popular methods for automatic image segmentation and 
frame-to-frame tracking of cells, and the considerations required to make 
measurements as quantitatively as possible.

The aim of this study was to assess the potential removal efficacy of viruses in 
a full-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) wastewater reuse system, using a range of 
indigenous and 'spiked' bacteriophages (phages) of known size and morphology. 
Samples were taken each week for three months from nine locations at each 
treatment stage of the water recycling plant (WRP) and tested for a range of 
microbiological parameters (n = 135). Mean levels of faecal coliforms were 
reduced to 0.3 CFU/100 ml in the MBR product and were undetected in samples 
taken after the chlorination stage. A relatively large reduction (5.3 log) in 
somatic coliphages was also observed following MBR treatment. However, 
F-specific and human-specific (GB124) phages were less abundant at all stages, 
and demonstrated log reductions post-MBR of 3.5 and 3.8, respectively. In 
'spiking' experiments, suspended 'spiked' phages (MS2 and B-14) displayed 
post-MBR log reductions of 2.25 and 2.30, respectively. The removal of these 
suspended phages, which are smaller than the membrane pore size (0.04 μm), also 
highlights the possible role of the membrane biofilm as an effective additional 
barrier to virus transmission. The findings from this study of a full-scale MBR 
system demonstrate that the enumeration of several phage groups may offer a 
practical and conservative way of assessing the ability of MBR to remove enteric 
viruses of human health significance. They also suggest that phage removal in 
MBR systems may be highly variable and may be closely related on the one hand to 
both the size and morphology of the viruses and, on the other, to whether or not 
they are attached to solids.

In this paper we provide numerical results for the electrostatic potential 
profile of a soft charged particle with a charged core and pH-dependent charge 
density. The present study serves as a useful platform for better quantification 
of the electrostatic potential profile of the MS2 bacteriophage virus. In this 
context, this work improves the analysis of a similar recent study [Phan et al., 
J. Chem. Phys. 139 (2013) 244908] in two aspects. First, as compared to the 
previous study, we provide numerical rather than analytical results for the 
electrostatic potential profile. This is important because the analytical 
treatment forbids the investigation of cases with intermediate to large charge 
density, relative to the bulk charge density of the electrolyte, of the viral 
surface. Second, the consideration of pH-dependent charge density in the 
electrostatic potential profile is a more credible representation of the 
electrostatics of the virus, which is known to demonstrate pH-dependent 
variation in the electrophoretic mobility. In fact, we establish that the 
various predictions on the electrostatic potential profile made in the previous 
study are substantially modified when the effect of pH is considered, and the 
result must now be described in terms of the difference pH-pKa, where Ka refers 
to the ionization constant of the acid that produces the PEL ions.

Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) has caused severe economic losses to millions of 
farmers worldwide. In this work, the coding genes of 141-160 epitope peptide 
(EP141-160) of VP1 were inserted into the coat protein (CP) genes of MS2 in 
prokaryotic expression vector, and the recombinant protein self-assembled into 
virus-like particles (VLP). Results showed that the CP-EP141-160 VLP had a 
strong immunoreaction with the FMD virus (FMDV) antigen in vitro, and also had 
an effective immune response in mice. Further virus challenge tests were carried 
out on guinea pigs and swine, high-titer neutralizing antibodies were produced 
and the CP-EP141-160 VLP vaccine could protect most of the animals against FMDV.

In this study, batch experiments were performed to examine the adhesion of 
bacteriophage MS2 to three iron oxide particles (IOP1, IOP2 and IOP3) with 
different particle properties. The characteristics of MS2 and iron oxides were 
analyzed using various techniques to construct the classical DLVO and XDLVO 
potential energy profiles between MS2 and iron oxides. X-ray diffractometry 
peaks indicated that IOP1 was mainly composed of maghemite (γ-Fe2O3), but also 
contained some goethite (α-FeOOH). IOP2 was composed of hematite (α-Fe2O3) and 
IOP3 was composed of iron (Fe), magnetite (Fe3O4) and iron oxide (FeO). 
Transmission electron microscope images showed that the primary particle size of 
IOP1 (γ-Fe2O3) was 12.3±4.1nm. IOP2 and IOP3 had primary particle sizes of 
167±35nm and 484±192nm, respectively. A surface angle analyzer demonstrated that 
water contact angles of IOP1, IOP2, IOP3 and MS2 were 44.83, 64.00, 34.33 and 
33.00°, respectively. A vibrating sample magnetometer showed that the magnetic 
saturations of IOP1, IOP2 and IOP3 were 176.87, 17.02 and 946.85kA/m, 
respectively. Surface potentials measured in artificial ground water (AGW; 
0.075mM CaCl2, 0.082mM MgCl2, 0.051mM KCl, and 1.5mM NaHCO3; pH7.6) indicated 
that iron oxides and MS2 were negatively charged in AGW (IOP1=-0.0185V; 
IOP2=-0.0194V; IOP3=-0.0301V; MS2=-0.0245V). Batch experiments demonstrated that 
MS2 adhesion to iron oxides was favorable in the order of IOP1>IOP2>IOP3. This 
tendency was well predicted by the classical DLVO model. In the DLVO 
calculations, both the sphere-plate and sphere-sphere geometries predicted the 
same trend of MS2 adhesion to iron oxides. Additionally, noticeable differences 
were not found between the DLVO and XDLVO interaction energy profiles, 
indicating that hydrophobic interactions did not play a major role; 
electrostatic interactions, however, did influence MS2 adhesion to iron oxides. 
Furthermore, the aggregation of iron oxides was investigated with a modified 
XDLVO model. This model included magnetic interactions between the particles in 
order to predict the aggregation of iron oxides. Even though iron oxide particle 
aggregation could occur under experimental conditions, the DLVO model results 
using primary particle size were more suitable for the interactions between MS2 
and the iron oxides because of fast sorption of MS2 onto the surfaces of iron 
oxides.

Methods for Preparation of MS2 Phage-Like Particles and Their Utilization as 
Process Control Viruses in RT-PCR and qRT-PCR Detection of RNA Viruses From Food 
Matrices and Clinical Specimens.

RNA viruses are pathogenic agents of many serious infectious diseases affecting 
humans and animals. The detection of pathogenic RNA viruses is based on modern 
molecular methods, of which the most widely used methods are the reverse 
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the real-time quantitative 
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). All steps of RT-PCR 
and qRT-PCR should be strictly controlled to ensure the validity of obtained 
results. False-negative results may be caused not only by inhibition of RT 
or/and PCR steps but also by failure of the nucleic acid extraction step, 
particularly in the case of viral RNA extraction. The control of nucleic acid 
extraction generally involves the utilization of a non-pathogenic virus (process 
control virus) of similar structural properties to those of the target virus. 
Although in clinical samples the use of such process control virus is only 
recommended, in other kinds of settings such as food matrices its use is 
necessary. Currently, several different process control viruses are used for 
these purposes. Process control viruses can also be constructed artificially 
using technology for production of MS2 phage-like particles, which have many 
advantages in comparison with other used controls and are especially suited for 
controlling the detection and quantification of certain types of RNA viruses. 
The technology for production of MS2 phage-like particles is theoretically well 
established, uses the knowledge gained from the study of the familiar 
bacteriophage MS2 and utilizes many different approaches for the construction of 
the various process control viruses. Nevertheless, the practical use of MS2 
phage-like particles in routine diagnostics is relatively uncommon. The current 
situation with regard to the use of MS2 phage-like particles as process control 
viruses in detection of RNA viruses and different methods of their construction, 
purification and use are summarized and discussed in this review.

Simple, low-cost household interventions are known to be effective in lowering 
the incidence of waterborne diseases in developing countries. However, high 
costs along with operational and maintenance issues have prevented the 
successful adoption of these interventions among the affected communities. To 
address these limitations, a cost-effective, gravity-driven water purification 
cartridge has been developed by employing the synergistic disinfection action of 
low concentrations of silver and chlorine on bacteria and viruses. The silver 
and chlorine treatment components within the cartridge have been developed using 
inexpensive materials and integrated with a life indicator and 
auto-shut-off-mechanism within a compact form factor. The antibacterial as well 
as antiviral performance of the cartridge was tested by using ground water 
spiked with Escherichia coli and MS2 bacteriophage. The results show that, 
although individually, the silver and chlorine treatment systems were unable to 
inactivate the test strains, the integrated cartridge inactivates both bacteria 
as well as viruses up to the log reduction requirement of the USEPA guide 
standard for microbiological water purifiers over its designated life of 2,000 
liters.

Human adenoviruses (hAdVs) are pathogenic viruses responsible for public health 
problems worldwide. They have also been used as viral indicators in 
environmental systems. Coliphages (e.g., MS2, ΦX174) have also been studied as 
indicators of viral pollution in fecally contaminated water. Our objective was 
to evaluate the distribution of three viral fecal indicators (hAdVs, MS2, and 
ΦΧ174), between two different phyllosilicate clays (kaolinite and bentonite) and 
the aqueous phase. A series of static and dynamic experiments were conducted 
under two different temperatures (4, 25°C) for a time period of seven days. HAdV 
adsorption was examined in DNase I reaction buffer (pH=7.6, and ionic strength 
(IS)=1.4mM), whereas coliphage adsorption in phosphate buffered saline solution 
(pH=7, IS=2mM). Moreover, the effect of IS on hAdV adsorption under static 
conditions was evaluated. The adsorption of hAdV was assessed by real-time PCR 
and its infectivity was tested by cultivation methods. The coliphages MS2 and 
ΦΧ174 were assayed by the double-layer overlay method. The experimental results 
have shown that coliphage adsorption onto both kaolinite and bentonite was 
higher for the dynamic than the static experiments; whereas hAdV adsorption was 
lower under dynamic conditions. The adsorption of hAdV increased with decreasing 
temperature, contrary to the results obtained for the coliphages. This study 
examines the combined effect of temperature, agitation, clay type, and IS on 
hAdV adsorption onto clays. The results provide useful new information on the 
effective removal of viral fecal indicators (MS2, ΦX174 and hAdV) from dilute 
aqueous solutions by adsorption onto kaolinite and bentonite. Factors enabling 
enteric viruses to penetrate soils, groundwater and travel long distances within 
aquifers are important public health issues. Because the observed adsorption 
behavior of surrogate coliphages MS2 and ΦΧ174 is substantially different to 
that of hAdV, neither MS2 nor ΦΧ174 is recommended as a suitable model for 
adenovirus.

N-bromo-dimethylhydantoin polystyrene resin for water microbial decontamination.

Aviv O, Farah S, Amir N, Laout N, Ratner S, Domb AJ.

N-bromo-dimethylhydantoin polystyrene beads were synthesized and tested as 
antimicrobial agents for water microbial decontamination. Optimization of 
synthetic process was thoroughly investigated, including solvents used, ratio of 
reactants and reaction conditions, kilogram scale production, and detailed 
spectral analysis. The microbial inactivation efficiency was studied according 
to the NSF-231 Guide Standard and Protocol for Testing Microbiological Water 
Purifiers against Escherichia coli and MS2 phage. The tested resins maintained 
their activity for 550 L. Thus, N-bromo-dimethylhydantoin-polystyrene beads 
synthesized under optimized conditions at kilogram quantities have a potential 
use in water purification filters.

AIMS: To avoid interference by water-iodine disinfection chemistry and measure 
directly the effect of iodine, captured from a triiodide complex bound to a 
filter medium, on viability of penetrating viral particles.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Aerosols of MS2 coli phage were passed through control P100 
or iodinated High-Efficiency Particulate Air media, collected in plastic bags, 
incubated for 0-10 min, collected in an impinger containing thiosulphate to 
consume all unreacted iodine, plated and enumerated. Comparison of viable counts 
demonstrated antimicrobial activity with an apparent half-life for 
devitalization in tens of seconds; rate of kill decreased at low humidity and 
free iodine was captured by the bags.
CONCLUSIONS: The results support the mechanism of near-contact capture earlier 
proposed; however, the disinfection chemistry in the aerosol phase is very slow 
on the time scale of inhalation.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study shows that disinfection by 
filter-bound iodine in the aerosol phase is too slow to be clinically 
significant in individual respiratory protection, but that it might be of 
benefit to limit airborne transmission of infections in enclosed areas.

Redox conditions are known to affect the fate of viruses in porous media. 
Several studies report the relevance of colloid-facilitated virus transport in 
the subsurface, but detailed studies on the effect of anoxic conditions on virus 
retention in natural sediments are still missing. Therefore, we investigated the 
fate of viruses in natural flood plain sediments with different sesquioxide 
contents under anoxic conditions by considering sorption to the solid phase, 
sorption to mobilized colloids, and inactivation in the aqueous phase. Batch 
experiments were conducted under oxic and anoxic conditions at pH values between 
5.1 and 7.6, using bacteriophages MS2 and PhiX174 as model viruses. In addition 
to free and colloid-associated bacteriophages, dissolved and colloidal 
concentrations of Fe, Al and organic C as well as dissolved Ca were determined. 
Results showed that regardless of redox conditions, bacteriophages did not 
adsorb to mobilized colloids, even under favourable charge conditions. Under 
anoxic conditions, attenuation of bacteriophages was dominated by sorption over 
inactivation, with MS2 showing a higher degree of sorption than PhiX174. 
Inactivation in water was low under anoxic conditions for both bacteriophages 
with about one log10 decrease in concentration during 16 h. Increased Fe/Al 
concentrations and a low organic carbon content of the sediment led to enhanced 
bacteriophage removal under anoxic conditions. However, even in the presence of 
sufficient Fe/A-(hydr)oxides on the solid phase, bacteriophage sorption was low. 
We presume that organic matter may limit the potential retention of sesquioxides 
in anoxic sediments and should thus be considered for the risk assessment of 
virus breakthrough in the subsurface.

Microbial removals by a novel biofilter water treatment system.

Wendt C, Ives R, Hoyt AL, Conrad KE, Longstaff S, Kuennen RW, Rose JB.

Two point-of-use drinking water treatment systems designed using a carbon filter 
and foam material as a possible alternative to traditional biosand systems were 
evaluated for removal of bacteria, protozoa, and viruses. Two configurations 
were tested: the foam material was positioned vertically around the carbon 
filter in the sleeve unit or horizontally in the disk unit. The filtration 
systems were challenged with Cryptosporidium parvum, Raoultella terrigena, and 
bacteriophages P22 and MS2 before and after biofilm development to determine 
average log reduction (ALR) for each organism and the role of the biofilm. There 
was no significant difference in performance between the two designs, and both 
designs showed significant levels of removal (at least 4 log10 reduction in 
viruses, 6 log10 for protozoa, and 8 log10 for bacteria). Removal levels meet or 
exceeded Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards for microbial 
purifiers. Exploratory test results suggested that mature biofilm formation 
contributed 1-2 log10 reductions. Future work is recommended to determine field 
viability.

Experiments to determine the removal of viruses in different types of water 
(surface water from two reservoirs for drinking water treatment, treated 
groundwater and groundwater contaminated with either 5 or 30 % of wastewater) by 
ultrafiltration were performed with a semi-technical ultrafiltration unit. 
Concentrations of human adenoviruses (HAdVs), murine norovirus (MNV), and the 
bacteriophages MS2, ΦX174 and PRD1 were measured in the feed water and the 
filtrate, and log removal values were calculated. Bacteria added to the feed 
water were not detected in the filtrates. In contrast, in most cases viruses and 
bacteriophages were still present in the filtrates: log removal values were in 
the range of 1.4-6.3 depending on virus sizes and water qualities. Best removals 
were observed with bacteriophage PRD1 and HAdVs, followed by MNV and phages MS2 
and ΦX174. Virus size, however, was not the only criterion for efficient 
removal. In diluted wastewater as compared to drinking water and uncontaminated 
environmental waters, virus removal was clearly higher for all viruses, most 
likely due to higher membrane fouling. For quality assessment purposes of 
membrane filtration efficiencies with regard to the elimination of human viruses 
the small bacteriophages MS2 and ΦX174 should be used as conservative viral 
indicators.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the inactivation of adenovirus, reovirus 
and bacteriophages (MS2, ΦX174, 28B) in a fecal sludge. We conducted two 
experiments. In the first, we tested different compositions of the fecal sludge 
by mixing different amounts of water, feces and urine, totaling nine 
combinations which were kept at temperatures between 10 and 28°C. In the second 
study, urea was added to the mixtures, which were kept at temperatures from 5 to 
33°C. The inactivation was based on a combination of temperature, pH and 
uncharged ammonia concentration. The increase in pH and ammonia was provided 
mainly by urine content (Experiment 1) and by urine and added urea (Experiment 
2). The inactivation of bacteriophages was slower than the AdV and ReV. At 23°C 
and 28°, reasonable treatment times were obtained when pH was higher than 8.9 
and NH3 concentrations were higher than 35 and 55 mM respectively. With those 
conditions, the maximum time for a 3 log reduction in viruses, according to this 
study, would be 35 days (23°C) and 21 days (28°C). However, in most applications 
where helminth eggs are present, the treatment time and NH3 for sanitization 
will be the scaling criteria, as they are more persistent. Concerning the 
sanitization of effluents from latrines, vacuum toilets or dry toilets in 
developing countries with tropical and sub-tropical climates, the use of 
intrinsic ammonia combined with high pH can be effective in producing a safe and 
highly valuable liquid that can be used as a fertilizer. In the case of the 
fecal sludge with very intrinsic ammonia concentration (<20 mM), sanitization 
could still be achieved by the addition of urea.

Repetitive nucleotide or amino acid sequences are often engineered into probes 
and biosensors to achieve functional readouts and robust signal amplification. 
However, these repeated sequences are notoriously prone to aberrant deletion and 
degradation, impacting the ability to correctly detect and interpret biological 
functions. Here, we introduce a facile and generalizable approach to solve this 
often unappreciated problem by modifying the nucleotide sequences of the target 
mRNA to make them nonrepetitive but still functional ("synonymous"). We first 
demonstrated the procedure by designing a cassette of synonymous MS2 RNA motifs 
and tandem coat proteins for RNA imaging and showed a dramatic improvement in 
signal and reproducibility in single-RNA detection in live cells. The same 
approach was extended to enhancing the stability of engineered fluorescent 
biosensors containing a fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair of 
fluorescent proteins on which a great majority of systems thus far in the field 
are based. Using the synonymous modification to FRET biosensors, we achieved 
correct expression of full-length sensors, eliminating the aberrant truncation 
products that often were assumed to be due to nonspecific proteolytic cleavages. 
Importantly, the biological interpretations of the sensor are significantly 
different when a correct, full-length biosensor is expressed. Thus, we show here 
a useful and generally applicable method to maintain the integrity of expressed 
genes, critical for the correct interpretation of probe readouts.

RT-Bst: an integrated approach for reverse transcription and enrichment of cDNA 
from viral RNA.

Kabir MS, Clements MO, Kimmitt PT.

The synthesis of cDNA from RNA is challenging due to the inefficiency of reverse 
transcription (RT). In order to address this, an RT-Bst method was developed for 
sequential RT of RNA and Bst DNA polymerase amplification for enrichment of cDNA 
in a single-tube reaction. Using genomic RNA from bacteriophage MS2, the yield 
of cDNA produced by RT alone and RT-Bst were compared by analysis of polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR)-amplified products. A superior performance was observed 
when amplifying MS2 cDNA with random primers following RT-Bst compared to RT 
alone, indicating greater quantities of cDNA were present after RT-Bst. RT-Bst 
was also compared with RT alone for their relative ability to produce sufficient 
cDNA to amplify eight target regions spanning the respiratory syncytial virus 
(RSV) genome. Six out of eight targets were amplified consistently by PCR 
subsequent to RT-Bst amplification, whereas only three out of eight targets 
could be amplified after RT alone. The RSV sequences were selectively amplified 
using RSV-specific primers from a mixed template containing an excess of MS2 RNA 
without amplifying MS2 sequences. This suggests that RT-Bst can be used to 
amplify RNA sequences non-specifically using random primers and specifically 
using sequence-specific primers, and enhances the yield of cDNA when compared to 
RT alone.

Quantitative viral risk assessments for wastewaters are notoriously difficult. 
The often considered quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR reflects poorly on 
virus infectivity rates leading to inaccurate risk interpretations. Various 
techniques focused on the degradation of the nucleic acids of non-infective 
viruses were previously employed. We comparatively assessed the effectiveness of 
such enzymatic treatments for MS2 bacteriophage in treated wastewaters. The 
single use of RNase A at an appropriate concentration may be as effective as the 
combination of RNase followed by Proteinase K and more rapid. While all tested 
enzymatic treatments minimized recovery of RNA (>95 %) in the absence of 
infective MS2, none completely eliminated the signal recovery. Selection of any 
enzymatic protocol for minimizing recovery of RNA from degraded, non-infective 
viruses should balance the methods efficacy with its expediency.

BACKGROUND: Approximately 50% of norovirus cases in the United States occur in 
long-term care facilities; many incidences of rotavirus, sapovirus, and 
adenovirus also occur. The primary objectives of this study were to demonstrate 
movement of pathogenic viruses through a long-term care facility and to 
determine the impact of a hygiene intervention on viral transmission.
METHODS: The coliphage MS-2 was seeded onto a staff member's hands, and samples 
were collected after 4 hours from fomites and hands. After 3 consecutive days of 
sample collection, a 14-day hygiene intervention was implemented. Hand 
sanitizers, hand and face wipes, antiviral tissues, and a disinfectant spray 
were distributed to employees and residents. Seeding and sampling were repeated 
postintervention.
RESULTS: Analysis of the pre- and postintervention data was performed using a 
Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Significant reductions in the spread of MS-2 on hands 
(P = .0002) and fomites (P = .04) were observed postintervention, with a >99% 
average reduction of virus recovered from both hands and fomites.
CONCLUSION: Although MS-2 spread readily from hands to fomites and vice versa, 
the intervention reduced average MS-2 concentrations recovered from hands and 
fomites by up to 4 logs and also reduced the incidence of MS-2 recovery.

Improving the Visible Light Photoactivity of Supported Fullerene Photocatalysts 
through the Use of [C₇₀] Fullerene.

Moor KJ, Valle DC, Li C, Kim JH.

We herein present the first instance of employing [C₇₀] fullerene for 
photocatalytic ¹O₂ production in water, through covalent immobilization onto a 
mesoporous silica support via nucelophilic amine addition directly to 
fullerene's cage. This attachment approach prevents the aggregation of 
individual fullerene molecules in water, thus allowing fullerene to retain its 
photoactivity, yet is much less complex than other techniques commonly pursued 
to create such supported-fullerene materials, which typically rely on 
water-soluble fullerene derivatives and elaborate immobilization methods. The 
solid-supported C₇₀ material exhibits significantly improved aqueous 
visible-light photoactivity compared to previous C₆₀- and C₆₀-derivative-based 
supported fullerene materials. Further, this material rapidly inactivates MS2 
bacteriophage under sunlight illumination, oxidizes various organic 
contaminants, and does not appear to be significantly fouled by natural organic 
matter (NOM), highlighting the potential of these materials in real-world 
applications. Collectively, the ease of preparation and significantly enhanced 
visible-light photoactivity of these materials advance fullerene-based 
technologies for water treatment.

Republic of China.

With the rapid development of molecular diagnostic techniques, there is a 
growing need for quality controls and standards with favorable properties to 
monitor the entire detection process. In this study, we describe a novel method 
to produce armored hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA 
for use in nucleic acid tests, which was confirmed to be stable, homogeneous, 
noninfectious, nuclease resistant, and safe for shipping. We demonstrated that 
MS2 bacteriophage could successfully package double-stranded DNA of 1.3-, 3-, 
3.5-, and 6.5-kb length into viral capsids with high reassembly efficiency. This 
is the first application of RNA bacteriophage MS2 as a platform to encapsulate 
double-stranded DNA, forming virus-like particles (VLPs) which were 
indistinguishable from native MS2 capsids in size and morphology. Moreover, by 
analyzing the interaction mechanism of pac site and the MS2 coat protein (CP), 
we found that in addition to the recognized initiation signal TR-RNA, TR-DNA can 
also trigger spontaneous reassembly of CP dimers, providing a more convenient 
and feasible method of assembly. In conclusion, this straightforward and 
reliable manufacturing approach makes armored DNA an ideal control and standard 
for use in clinical laboratory tests and diagnostics, possessing prospects for 
broad application, especially providing a new platform for the production of 
quality controls for DNA viruses.

An ideal prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine would provide broadly 
protective and long-lasting immune responses against all high-risk HPV types, 
would be effective after a single dose, and would be formulated in such a manner 
to allow for long-term storage without the necessity for refrigeration. We have 
developed candidate HPV vaccines consisting of bacteriophage virus-like 
particles (VLPs) that display a broadly neutralizing epitope derived from the 
HPV16 minor capsid protein, L2. Immunization with 16L2 VLPs elicited high titer 
and broadly cross-reactive and cross-neutralizing antibodies against diverse HPV 
types. In this study we introduce two refinements for our candidate vaccines, 
with an eye towards enhancing efficacy and clinical applicability in the 
developing world. First, we assessed the role of antigen dose and boosting on 
immunogenicity. Mice immunized with 16L2-MS2 VLPs at doses ranging from 2 to 25 
μg with or without alum were highly immunogenic at all doses; alum appeared to 
have an adjuvant effect at the lowest dose. Although boosting enhanced antibody 
titers, even a single immunization could elicit strong and long-lasting antibody 
responses. We also developed a method to enhance vaccine stability. Using a 
spray dry apparatus and a combination of sugars & an amino acid as protein 
stabilizers, we generated dry powder vaccine formulations of our L2 VLPs. Spray 
drying of our L2 VLPs did not affect the integrity or immunogenicity of VLPs 
upon reconstitution. Spray dried VLPs were stable at room temperature and at 37 
°C for over one month and the VLPs were highly immunogenic. Taken together, 
these enhancements are designed to facilitate implementation of a 
next-generation VLP-based HPV vaccine which addresses U.S. and global 
disparities in vaccine affordability and access in rural/remote populations.

Factors affecting the decay of Salmonella Birkenhead and coliphage, as 
representatives of bacterial and viral pathogens, respectively, during 
mesophilic anaerobic digestion (MAD) and air drying treatment of anaerobically 
digested sewage sludge were investigated. Controlled concentrations of S. 
Birkenhead were inoculated into non-sterile, autoclaved, γ-irradiated and 
nutrient-supplemented sludge and cultures were incubated at 37 °C (MAD sludge 
treatment temperature) or 20 °C (summer air drying sludge treatment 
temperature). Nutrient limitation caused by microbial competition was the 
principal mechanism responsible for the decay of S. Birkenhead by MAD and during 
air drying of digested sludge. The effects of protease activity in sludge on MS2 
coliphage decay in digested and air dried sludge were also investigated. MS2 
coliphage showed a 3.0-3.5 log10 reduction during incubation with 
sludge-protease extracts at 37 °C for 25 h. Proteases produced by indigenous 
microbes in sludge potentially increase coliphage inactivation and may therefore 
have a significant role in the decay of enteric viruses in sewage sludge. The 
results help to explain the loss of viability of enteric bacteria and viral 
pathogens with treatment process time and contribute to fundamental 
understanding of the various biotic inactivation mechanisms operating in sludge 
treatment processes at mesophilic and ambient temperatures.

This study determined whether a hand sanitizing wipe can reduce virus 
transmission in households, and could reduce the probability of infection by 
rhinovirus and rotavirus. Bacteriophage MS-2 (a marker virus) was used to assess 
viral transmission in five households having at least two children of ages 2-18. 
Hands of one female adult were inoculated with ~10(8) PFU MS-2 bacteriophages in 
each home, and after 8 h, hands of all family members and select fomites were 
sampled to determine baseline contamination without intervention. This sequence 
was repeated with the intervention, where all family members were instructed to 
use a quaternary ammonium compound-based sanitizing wipe at least once per day. 
A significant reduction of virus after the intervention occurred on inoculated 
hands (95.3%; p = 0.0039), all fomites combined (74.5%; p < 0.005), and 
non-inoculated hands and fomites combined (73.5%; p < 0.005). However, viral 
reduction on non-inoculated hands was not significant, likely due to small 
sample size. Using rhinovirus and rotavirus as models it was estimated that 
infection risk was reduced by ~30 to 89% with the use of sanitizing wipes once 
per day depending on the starting concentration of these viruses on hands of 
susceptible individuals. Therefore, using a hand sanitizing wipe can 
significantly reduce viral transmission and risk of illness in homes. Previous 
studies have shown other hand hygiene interventions, such as alcohol-based hand 
sanitizers, are even more effective for reducing risk of illness in homes; 
however the sanitizing wipe used in this study is appropriate to use for 
microbial reduction.

Viral illnesses such as gastroenteritis and the common cold create a substantial 
burden in the workplace due to reduced productivity, increased absenteeism, and 
increased health care costs. Behaviors in the workplace contribute to the spread 
of human viruses via direct contact between hands, contaminated surfaces, and 
the mouth, eyes, and/or nose. This study assessed whether implementation of the 
Healthy Workplace Project (HWP) (providing hand sanitizers, disinfecting wipes, 
facial tissues, and use instructions) would reduce viral loads in an office 
setting of approximately 80 employees after seeding fomites and the hands of 
volunteer participants with an MS-2 phage tracer. The HWP significantly reduced 
viable phage detected on participants' hands, communal fomites, and personal 
fomites (p ≤ .010) in office environments and presents a cost-effective method 
for reducing the health and economic burden associated with viral illnesses in 
the workplace.

According to the risk assessment of the WHO, highly infectious pathogenic 
viruses like rotaviruses should not be present in large-volume drinking water 
samples of up to 90 m(3). On the other hand, quantification methods for viruses 
are only operable in small volumes, and presently no concentration procedure for 
processing such large volumes has been reported. Therefore, the aim of this 
study was to demonstrate a procedure for processing viruses in-line of a 
drinking water pipeline by ultrafiltration (UF) and consecutive further 
concentration by monolithic filtration (MF) and centrifugal ultrafiltration 
(CeUF) of viruses to a final 1-mL sample. For testing this concept, the model 
virus bacteriophage MS2 was spiked continuously in UF instrumentation. Tap water 
was processed in volumes between 32.4 m(3) (22 h) and 97.7 m(3) (72 h) 
continuously either in dead-end (DE) or cross-flow (CF) mode. Best results were 
found by DE-UF over 22 h. The concentration of MS2 was increased from 4.2×10(4) 
GU/mL (genomic units per milliliter) to 3.2×10(10) GU/mL and from 71 PFU/mL to 
2×10(8) PFU/mL as determined by qRT-PCR and plaque assay, respectively.

AIMS: The phagicidal activity of peroxy products against the virulent 
bacteriophage P001 infecting lactic acid bacteria and bacteriophage MS2 used as 
a surrogate of enteric viruses (EVs) was evaluated and compared to sodium 
hypochlorite using the EN 13610 European suspension test and a surface test 
developed in our laboratories.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Infectivity tests were adapted and/or developed to 
determine the activity of disinfectants against reference P001 phage of 
Lactoccocus lactis and F-specific RNA phage MS2 of Escherichia coli in 
conditions simulating practical use. Similar concentrations of sodium 
hypochlorite were phagicidal against both bacteriophages, either at 0·05-0·125% 
of active chlorine using the suspension test or at 0·12-0·5% using the surface 
test. For Potassium monopersulphate (MPS), phagicidal concentrations varied from 
0·006 to 0·012% whatever the type of test and phages. However, for peracetic 
acid products (PAP) used in suspension, concentrations 55 times higher were 
necessary against MS2 (0·271%) than against P001 (0·005%). With the surface 
test, 0·089-0·178% concentrations of PAP were effective against MS2, but these 
concentrations were 16-32 times greater than needed against P001.
CONCLUSIONS: Sodium hypochlorite and MPS had similar phagicidal activities 
against P001 and MS2, but PAP did not.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first comparative study to 
investigate through suspension and surface tests the difference in resistance to 
peroxy compounds between a reference bacteriophage (P001) used to evaluate 
phagicidal concentrations in European standards and a surrogate of EVs (MS2). 
Results underline the importance of validation tests on pertinent surrogates of 
viruses or bacteriophages to adjust the concentration of disinfectants for use 
in the food and water industries.

Bacteriophages are regarded as enteric viral indicators in faecally contaminated 
water systems and may indicate the presence of human viral pollution. They are 
relatively resistant to inactivation by natural and treatment processes. In this 
study, the presence of somatic coliphages and F-RNA coliphages was investigated 
in potable water from rural areas in the North West province. Water samples were 
aseptically collected from boreholes and tap water from some rural communities 
in the North West Province. Physical parameters of the water, such as the 
temperature, pH and turbidity, were measured before sample collection. 
Double-agar layer assay was performed using ISO, (1995, 2000) standard methods. 
Bottled water was used as a negative control and the strains фX174 and MS2 as 
positive controls. Of the 16 water samples collected, 15 were positive for 
somatic bacteriophages while F-RNA coliphages were detected in only two samples. 
Amongst the positive samples 189 and three plaque forming units were obtained 
for both somatic and F-RNA coliphages, respectively. No coliphage was detected 
in water from Masamane tap 1. The rest of the samples obtained from various 
rural areas were positive and did not comply with national and international 
standards for potable water. This was a cause for concern and should be further 
investigated.

The feasibility of substituting a conventional pre-treatment, consisting of 
dioxi-chlorination, coagulation/flocculation, settling and sand filtration, of a 
drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) by direct ultrafiltration (UF) has been 
assessed from a microbiological standpoint. Bacterial indicators, viral 
indicators and human viruses have been monitored in raw river, ultrafiltered and 
conventionally pre-treated water samples during two years. Direct UF has proven 
to remove bacterial indicators quite efficiently and to a greater extent than 
the conventional process does. Nevertheless, the removal of small viruses such 
as some small bacteriophages and human viruses (e.g. enteroviruses and 
noroviruses) is lower than the current conventional pre-treatment. Membrane 
integrity has been assessed during two years by means of tailored tests based on 
bacteriophages with different properties (MS-2, GA and PDR-1) and bacterial 
spores (Bacillus spores). Membrane integrity has not been compromised despite 
the challenging conditions faced by directly treating raw river water. 
Bacteriophage PDR-1 appears as a suitable microbe to test membrane integrity, as 
its size is slightly larger than the considered membrane pore size. However, its 
implementation at full scale plant is still challenging due to difficulties in 
obtaining enough phages for its seeding.

falciparum Blood Stage Antigen AMA1 Using Virus-Like Particle (VLP) Peptide 
Display.

We have developed a peptide display platform based on VLPs of the RNA 
bacteriophage MS2 that combines the high immunogenicity of VLP display with 
affinity selection capabilities. Random peptides can be displayed on the VLP 
surface by genetically inserting sequences into a surface-exposed loop of the 
viral coat protein. VLP-displayed peptides can then be isolated by selection 
using antibodies, and the VLP selectants can then be used directly as 
immunogens. Here, we investigated the ability of this platform to identify 
mimotopes of a highly conserved conformational epitope present on the Plasmodium 
falciparum blood-stage protein AMA1. Using 4G2, a monoclonal antibody that binds 
to this epitope and is a potent inhibitor of erythrocyte invasion, we screened 
three different VLP-peptide libraries and identified specific VLPs that bound 
strongly to the selecting mAb. We then tested the ability of a handful of 
selected VLPs to elicit anti-AMA1 antibody responses in mice. Most of the 
selected VLPs failed to reliably elicit AMA1 specific antibodies. However, one 
VLP consistently induced antibodies that cross-reacted with AMA1. Surprisingly, 
this VLP bound to 4G2 more weakly than the other selectants we identified. Taken 
together, these data demonstrate that VLP-peptide display can identify 
immunogenic mimics of a complex conformational epitope and illustrate the 
promise and challenges of this approach.

Enteric viruses are a major problem in the food industry, especially as human 
noroviruses are the leading cause of nonbacterial gastroenteritis. Chitosan is 
known to be effective against some enteric viral surrogates, but more detailed 
studies are needed to determine the precise application variables. The main 
objective of this work was to determine the effect of increasing chitosan 
concentration (0.7-1.5% w/v) on the cultivable enteric viral surrogates, feline 
calicivirus (FCV-F9), murine norovirus (MNV-1), and bacteriophages (MS2 and 
phiX174) at 37 °C. Two chitosans (53 and 222 kDa) were dissolved in water (53 
kDa) or 1% acetic acid (222 KDa) at 0.7-1.5%, and were then mixed with each 
virus to obtain a titer of ~5 log plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL. These mixtures 
were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. Controls included untreated viruses in 
phosphate-buffered saline and viruses were enumerated by plaque assays. The 53 
kDa chitosan at the concentrations tested reduced FCV-F9, MNV-1, MS2, and phi 
X174 by 2.6-2.9, 0.1-0.4, 2.6-2.8, and 0.7-0.9 log PFU/mL, respectively, while 
reduction by 222 kDa chitosan was 2.2-2.4, 0.8-1.0, 2.6-5.2, and 0.5-0.8 log 
PFU/mL, respectively. The 222 kDa chitosan at 1 and 0.7% w/v in acetic acid (pH 
4.5) caused the greatest reductions of MS2 by 5.2 logs and 2.6 logs, 
respectively. Overall, chitosan treatments showed the greatest reduction of MS2, 
followed by FCV-F9, phi X174, and MNV-1. These two chitosans may contribute to 
the reduction of enteric viruses at the concentrations tested but would require 
use of other hurdles to eliminate food borne viruses.

A portable booth designed to disinfect full-body coverage protective equipment 
before removal using ultraviolet-C radiation resulted in at least 3 log 
reductions in bacteriophage MS2 and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 
within 3 minutes. The booth could be useful for disinfection of contaminated

Hydantoin-N-halamine derivatives conjugated on polystyrene beads are promising 
disinfectants with broad antimicrobial activity affected by the gradual release 
of oxidizing halogen in water. The objective of this work was to identify and 
test of hydantoin-like molecules possessing urea moiety, which may provide 
N-haloamines releasing oxidizing halogens when exposed to water at different 
rates and release profiles for tailored antimicrobial agents. In this work, 
several hydantoin (five member ring) and for the first time reported, uracil 
(six member ring) derivatives have been conjugated to polystyrene beads and 
tested for their lasting antimicrobial activity. Four molecules of each series 
were conjugated onto polystyrene beads from the reaction of the N-potassium 
hydantoin or uracil derivatives onto chloromethylated polystyrene beads. A 
distinct difference in bromine loading capacity and release profiles was found 
for the different conjugated derivatives. All tested materials exhibit strong 
antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and bacteriophages MS2 of 7 and 
~4 log reduction, respectively. These results highlight the antimicrobial 
potential of halogenated cyclic molecules containing urea groups as water 
disinfection agents.

In this study we investigated the removal of viruses with similar size and shape 
but with different external surface capsid proteins by a bench-scale membrane 
bioreactor (MBR). The goal was to determine which virus removal mechanisms 
(retention by clean backwashed membrane, retention by cake layer, attachment to 
biomass, and inactivation) were most impacted by differences in the virus 
surface properties. Seven bench-scale MBR experiments were performed using mixed 
liquor wastewater sludge that was seeded with three lab-cultured bacteriophages 
with icosahedral capsids of ∼30 nm diameter (MS2, phiX174, and fr). The 
operating conditions were designed to simulate those at a reference, full-scale 
MBR facility. The virus removal mechanism most affected by virus type was 
attachment to biomass (removals of 0.2 log for MS2, 1.2 log for phiX174, and 
3 log for fr). These differences in removal could not be explained by 
electrostatic interactions, as the three viruses had similar net negative charge 
when suspended in MBR permeate. Removals by the clean backwashed membrane (less 
than 1 log) and cake layer (∼0.6 log) were similar for the three viruses. A 
comparison between the clean membrane removals seen at the bench-scale using a 
virgin membrane (∼1 log), and the full-scale using 10-year old membranes 
(∼2-3 logs) suggests that irreversible fouling, accumulated on the membrane over 
years of operation that cannot be removed by cleaning, also contributes towards 
virus removal. This study enhances the current mechanistic understanding of 
virus removal in MBRs and will contribute to more reliable treatment for water 
reuse applications.

The use of aerosolized bacteriophages as surrogates for hazardous viruses might 
simplify and accelerate the discovery of links between viral components and 
their persistence in the airborne state under diverse environmental conditions. 
In this study, four structurally distinct lytic phages, MS2 (single-stranded RNA 
[ssRNA]), ϕ6 (double-stranded RNA [dsRNA]), ϕX174 (single-stranded DNA [ssDNA]), 
and PR772 (double-stranded DNA [dsDNA]), were nebulized into a rotating chamber 
and exposed to various levels of relative humidity (RH) and temperature as well 
as to germicidal UV radiation. The aerosolized viral particles were allowed to 
remain airborne for up to 14 h before being sampled for analysis by plaque 
assays and quantitative PCRs. Phages ϕ6 and MS2 were the most resistant at low 
levels of relative humidity, while ϕX174 was more resistant at 80% RH. Phage ϕ6 
lost its infectivity immediately after exposure to 30°C and 80% RH. The 
infectivity of all tested phages rapidly declined as a function of the exposure 
time to UVC radiation, phage MS2 being the most resistant. Taken altogether, our 
data indicate that these aerosolized phages behave differently under various 
environmental conditions and highlight the necessity of carefully selecting 
viral simulants in bioaerosol studies.

The objective of this study was to identify sources of fecal contamination in 
leek and parsley, by using four different F(+)RNA coliphage genogroups (IV, I 
indicate animal fecal contamination and II, III indicate human fecal 
contamination). Three different concentrations (10(2), 10(4), 10(6) pfu/ml) of 
MS2 coliphage were inoculated on the surface of parsley and leek samples for 
detection of phage recovery efficiency among two methods of elution 
concentration (PEG-precipitation and Ultracentrifugation) by performing double 
agar layer (DAL) assay in three replications. Highest recovery of MS2 was 
observed in PEG method and in 10(6) inoculation concentration. Accordingly, the 
PEG method was used for washing and isolation of potentially contaminated phages 
of 30 collected samples (15 samples from the market and 15 samples from the 
farm). The final solutions of PEG method were tested for the enumeration of 
plaques by DAL assay. Total RNA was then extracted from recovered phages, and 
RT-PCR was performed by using four primer sets I, II, III, and IV. Incidence of 
F(+)RNA coliphages was observed in 12/15 (80 %) and 10/15 (66/6 %) of samples 
were obtained from farm and market, respectively, using both DAL and RT-PCR test 
methods. Different genotypes (I, II, and IV) of F(+)RNA coliphages were found in 
farm samples, while only genotype I was detected in market samples by using the 
primer sets. Due to the higher frequency of genotype I and IV, the absence of 
genotype III, and also the low frequency of genotype II, it is concluded that 
the contamination of vegetable (parsley and leek) in Neyshabour, Iran is most 
likely originated from animal sources.

Comparative and comprehensive investigations for adenovirus recognition and 
detection were conducted using plastic and natural antibodies to compare three 
different strategies. The implementation of molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) 
technology for specific and sensitive recognition of viruses with the 
combination of biosensors was reported. Plastic antibodies (MIPs nanoparticles) 
were produced for adenovirus by employing a novel solid phase synthesis method. 
MIP receptors were then characterised using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and 
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques prior to immobilisation on a 
surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor as affinity receptor for adenovirus 
detection. Two different templates were also imprinted as control MIPs 
(vancomycin-MIP and MS2-MIP). The specific recognition of adenovirus was 
investigated in the concentration range of 0.01-20 pM and the limit of detection 
was achieved as 0.02 pM. As an alternative to MIP receptors, direct and sandwich 
assays were developed for adenovirus quantification using natural antibodies. 
The detection limit of direct and sandwich assays were found as 0.3 pM and 0.008 
pM, respectively. The kinetic data analyses were performed for three different 
adenovirus recognition methods and cross-reactivity studies were also conducted 
using MS2 phage as control virus and an excellent specificity was achieved with 
all assays types. This work confirmed the suitability of the MIPs SPR sensor for 
the detection of viruses.

Human noroviruses (NoV) are the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis 
worldwide. Epidemiological studies of outbreaks have suggested that vomiting 
facilitates transmission of human NoV, but there have been no laboratory-based 
studies characterizing the degree of NoV release during a vomiting event. The 
purpose of this work was to demonstrate that virus aerosolization occurs in a 
simulated vomiting event, and to estimate the amount of virus that is released 
in those aerosols. A simulated vomiting device was constructed at one-quarter 
scale of the human body following similitude principles. Simulated vomitus 
matrices at low (6.24 mPa*s) and high (177.5 mPa*s) viscosities were inoculated 
with low (108 PFU/mL) and high (1010 PFU/mL) concentrations of bacteriophage MS2 
and placed in the artificial "stomach" of the device, which was then subjected 
to scaled physiologically relevant pressures associated with vomiting. Bio 
aerosols were captured using an SKC Biosampler. In low viscosity artificial 
vomitus, there were notable differences between recovered aerosolized MS2 as a 
function of pressure (i.e., greater aerosolization with increased pressure), 
although this was not always statistically significant. This relationship 
disappeared when using high viscosity simulated vomitus. The amount of MS2 
aerosolized as a percent of total virus "vomited" ranged from 7.2 x 10-5 to 2.67 
x 10-2 (which corresponded to a range of 36 to 13,350 PFU total). To our 
knowledge, this is the first study to document and measure aerosolization of a 
NoV surrogate in a similitude-based physical model. This has implications for 
better understanding the transmission dynamics of human NoV and for risk 
modeling purposes, both of which can help in designing effective infection 
control measures.

Long wavelengths of sunlight spectrum (UVA and visible light), as well as 
natural organic matter (NOM) are important environmental factors affecting 
survival of viruses in aquatic environment through direct and indirect 
inactivation. In order to understand the virus inactivation kinetics under such 
conditions, this study investigated the effects of Suwannee River natural 
organic matter (NOM) on the inactivation of a somatic coliphage, phiX174, by UVA 
and visible light. Experiments were carried out to examine the virucidal effects 
of UVA/visible light, assess the influence of SRNOM at different concentrations, 
and identify the effective ROS in virus inactivation. The results from this 
study showed that the presence of NOM could either enhance virus inactivation or 
reduce virus inactivation depending on the concentration, where the inactivation 
rate followed a parabolic relationship against NOM concentration. The results 
indicated that moderate levels of NOM (11 ppm) had the strongest antiviral 
activity, while very low or very high NOM concentrations prolonged virus 
survival. The results also showed that OH▪ was the primary ROS in causing 
phiX174 (ssDNA virus) inactivation, unlike previous findings where (1)O2 was the 
primary ROS causing MS2 (ssRNA virus) inactivation. The phiX174 inactivation by 
OH∙ could be described as k=3.7 ✕ 10(13)[OH∙]+1.404 (R(2)=0.8527).

Our objective here is to review the novel delivery platform based on 
Bacteriophage MS2 virus-like particles (VLPs), including introduction to their 
structure, their potential as a delivery platform, and their expected use in 
medicine and other fields. Bacteriophage MS2 VLPs are nanoparticles devoid of 
viral genetic material and can self-assemble from the coat protein into an 
icosahedral capsid. As a novel delivery platform, they possess numerous features 
that make them suitable and attractive for targeted delivery of RNAs or DNAs, 
epitope peptides, and drugs within the protein capsid. In short, as a novel 
delivery platform, MS2 VLPs are suitable for delivery of targeted agents and 
hold promise for use in diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutic modalities.

In this study, the effect of dust loading on the anti-viral ability of an 
anti-viral air filter was investigated. Silver nanoparticles approximately 11 nm 
in diameter were synthesized via a spark discharge generation system and were 
used as anti-viral agents coated onto a medium air filter. The pressure drop, 
filtration efficiency, and anti-viral ability of the filter against aerosolized 
bacteriophage MS2 virus particles were tested with dust loading. The filtration 
efficiency and pressure drop increased with dust loading, while the anti-viral 
ability decreased. Theoretical analysis of anti-viral ability with dust loading 
was carried out using a mathematical model based on that presented by Joe et al. 
(J. Hazard. Mater.; 280: 356-363, 2014). Our model can be used to compare 
anti-viral abilities of various anti-viral agents, determine appropriate coating 
areal density of anti-viral agent on a filter, and predict the life cycle of an 
anti-viral filter.

Efficacy of Coral Sand for Removal of and Bacteriophage under Saturated Flow 
Conditions.

Burbery L, Weaver L, Humphries B, Gregor J.

Knowledge of how effectively microbes are transported through porous media is 
useful for water resource/wastewater management. Despite much research having 
been done to characterize microbial contaminant transport through various 
sedimentary materials, very little study has been made on coral sand, such as 
constitutes the primary substrate of many Pacific atolls. We conducted a set of 
laboratory column experiments as a preliminary examination of how effective 
coral sand is at attenuating model pathogens J6-2 and MS2 bacteriophage (phage) 
under saturated flow conditions mildly representative of field conditions at the 
Bonriki freshwater lens, South Tarawa, Kiribati. The very poorly sorted gravelly 
sand coral substrate tested proved very effective at attenuating the bacterial 
tracer, and spatial removal rates of between 0.02 and 0.07 log cm were 
determined for J6-2. The ability to determine precise removal rates for MS2 
phage was compromised by the use of a plastic apparatus, although the evidence 
weights toward coral sand being less effective at attenuating MS2 phage than it 
is . Further research is required to fully assess the ability of coral sand to 
remove pathogens and to explore how this medium could be engineered into 
cost-effective water/wastewater treatment solutions on Pacific atolls. The phage 
data from this work highlight the limitations of using plastic apparatus in 
experiments targeted at characterizing the fate and transport of viruses.

Attachment and Detachment Behavior of Human Adenovirus and Surrogates in Fine 
Granular Limestone Aquifer Material.

Stevenson ME, Sommer R, Lindner G, Farnleitner AH, Toze S, Kirschner AK, 
Blaschke AP, Sidhu JP.

The transport of human adenovirus, nanoparticles, and PRD1 and MS2 
bacteriophages was tested in fine granular limestone aquifer material taken from 
a borehole at a managed aquifer recharge site in Adelaide, South Australia. 
Comparison of transport and removal of virus surrogates with the pathogenic 
virus is necessary to understand the differences between the virus and 
surrogate. Because experiments using pathogenic viruses cannot be done in the 
field, laboratory tests using flow-through soil columns were used. Results show 
that PRD1 is the most appropriate surrogate for adenovirus in an aquifer 
dominated by calcite material but not under high ionic strength or high pH 
conditions. It was also found that straining due to size and the charge of the 
colloid were not dominant removal mechanisms in this system. Implications of 
this study indicate that a certain surrogate may not represent a specific 
pathogen solely based on similar size, morphology, and/or surface charge. 
Moreover, if a particular surrogate is representative of a pathogen in one 
aquifer system, it may not be the most appropriate surrogate in another porous 
media system. This was apparent in the inferior performance of MS2 as a 
surrogate, which is commonly used in virus transport studies.

Proteins are important targets of chemical disinfectants. To improve the 
understanding of disinfectant-protein reactions, this study characterized the 
disinfectant:protein molar ratios at which 50% degradation of oxidizable amino 
acids (i.e., Met, Tyr, Trp, His, Lys) and structure were observed during HOCl, 
HOBr, and O3 treatment of three well-characterized model proteins and 
bacteriophage MS2. A critical question is the extent to which the targeting of 
amino acids is driven by their disinfectant rate constants rather than their 
geometrical arrangement. Across the model proteins and bacteriophage MS2 (coat 
protein), differing widely in structure, methionine was preferentially targeted, 
forming predominantly methionine sulfoxide. This targeting concurs with its high 
disinfectant rate constants and supports its hypothesized role as a sacrificial 
antioxidant. Despite higher HOCl and HOBr rate constants with histidine and 
lysine than for tyrosine, tyrosine generally was degraded in preference to 
histidine, and to a lesser extent, lysine. These results concur with the 
prevalence of geometrical motifs featuring histidines or lysines near tyrosines, 
facilitating histidine and lysine regeneration upon Cl[+1] transfer from their 
chloramines to tyrosines. Lysine nitrile formation occurred at or above oxidant 
doses where 3,5-dihalotyrosine products began to degrade. For O3, which lacks a 
similar oxidant transfer pathway, histidine, tyrosine, and lysine degradation 
followed their relative O3 rate constants. Except for its low reactivity with 
lysine, the O3 doses required to degrade amino acids were as low as or lower 
than for HOCl or HOBr, indicating its oxidative efficiency. Loss of structure 
did not correlate with loss of particular amino acids, suggesting the need to 
characterize the oxidation of specific geometric motifs to understand structural 
degradation.

Solar disinfection (SODIS) of drinking water in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) 
bottles is a simple, efficient point-of-use technique for the inactivation of 
many bacterial pathogens. In contrast, the efficiency of SODIS against viruses 
is not well known. In this work, we studied the inactivation of bacteriophages 
(MS2 and ϕX174) and human viruses (echovirus 11 and adenovirus type 2) by SODIS. 
We conducted experiments in PET bottles exposed to (simulated) sunlight at 
different temperatures (15, 22, 26, and 40°C) and in water sources of diverse 
compositions and origins (India and Switzerland). Good inactivation of MS2 
(>6-log inactivation after exposure to a total fluence of 1.34 kJ/cm(2)) was 
achieved in Swiss tap water at 22°C, while less-efficient inactivation was 
observed in Indian waters and for echovirus (1.5-log inactivation at the same 
fluence). The DNA viruses studied, ϕX174 and adenovirus, were resistant to 
SODIS, and the inactivation observed was equivalent to that occurring in the 
dark. High temperatures enhanced MS2 inactivation substantially; at 40°C, 3-log 
inactivation was achieved in Swiss tap water after exposure to a fluence of only 
0.18 kJ/cm(2). Overall, our findings demonstrate that SODIS may reduce the load 
of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses, such as echoviruses, particularly at 
high temperatures and in photoreactive matrices. In contrast, complementary 
measures may be needed to ensure efficient inactivation during SODIS of DNA 
viruses resistant to oxidation.

In this study, hollow-fiber ultrafiltration (UF) was assessed for recovery of 
Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens spores, Cryptosporidium parvum 
oocysts, echovirus 1, and bacteriophages MS2 and ΦX174 from ground and surface 
waters. Microbes were seeded into twenty-two 50-L water samples that were 
collected from the Southeastern United States and concentrated to ∼500 mL by UF. 
Secondary concentration was performed for C. parvum by centrifugation followed 
by immunomagnetic separation. Secondary concentration for viruses was performed 
using centrifugal ultrafilters or polyethylene glycol precipitation. Nine water 
quality parameters were measured in each water sample to determine whether water 
quality data correlated with UF and secondary concentration recovery 
efficiencies. Average UF recovery efficiencies were 66%-95% for the six enteric 
microbes. Average recovery efficiencies for the secondary concentration methods 
were 35%-95% for C. parvum and the viruses. Overall, measured water quality 
parameters were not significantly associated with UF recovery efficiencies. 
However, recovery of ΦX174 was negatively correlated with turbidity. The 
recovery data demonstrate that UF can be an effective method for concentrating 
diverse microbes from ground and surface waters. This study highlights the 
utility of tangential-flow hollow fiber ultrafiltration for recovery of 
bacteria, viruses, and parasites from large volume environmental water samples.

Presence of Hydroxylamine: Dual Microbicidal Effects.

The inactivation of Escherichia coli and MS2 coliphage by Cu(II) is found to be 
significantly enhanced in the presence of hydroxylamine (HA). The addition of a 
small amount of HA (i.e., 5-20 μM) increased the inactivation efficacies of E. 
coli and MS2 coliphage by 5- to 100-fold, depending on the conditions. Dual 
effects were anticipated to enhance the biocidal activity of Cu(II) by the 
addition of HA, viz. (i) the accelerated reduction of Cu(II) into Cu(I) (a 
stronger biocide) and (ii) the production of reactive oxidants from the reaction 
of Cu(I) with dissolved oxygen (evidenced by the oxidative transformation of 
methanol into formaldehyde). Deaeration enhanced the inactivation of E. coli but 
slightly decreased the inactivation efficacy of MS2 coliphage. The addition of 
10 μM hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) greatly enhanced the MS2 inactivation, whereas 
the same concentration of H2O2 did not significantly affect the inactivation 
efficacy of E. coli Observations collectively indicate that different biocidal 
actions lead to the inactivation of E. coli and MS2 coliphage. The toxicity of 
Cu(I) is dominantly responsible for the E. coli inactivation. However, for the 
MS2 coliphage inactivation, the oxidative damage induced by reactive oxidants is 
as important as the effect of Cu(I).

Using cross-linking coupled to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass 
spectrometry and CLIP-Seq sequencing, we determined the peptide and 
oligonucleotide sequences at the interfaces between the capsid proteins and the 
genomic RNA of bacteriophage MS2. The results suggest that the same coat protein 
(CP)-RNA and maturation protein (MP)-RNA interfaces are used in every viral 
particle. The portions of the viral RNA in contact with CP subunits span the 
genome, consistent with a large number of discrete and similar contacts within 
each particle. Many of these sites match previous predictions of the locations 
of multiple, dispersed and degenerate RNA sites with cognate CP affinity termed 
packaging signals (PSs). Chemical RNA footprinting was used to compare the 
secondary structures of protein-free genomic fragments and the RNA in the 
virion. Some PSs are partially present in protein-free RNA but others would need 
to refold from their dominant solution conformations to form the contacts 
identified in the virion. The RNA-binding peptides within the MP map to two 
sections of the N-terminal half of the protein. Comparison of MP sequences from 
related phages suggests a similar arrangement of RNA-binding sites, although 
these N-terminal regions have only limited sequence conservation. In contrast, 
the sequences of the C-termini are highly conserved, consistent with them 
encompassing pilin-binding domains required for initial contact with host cells. 
These results provide independent and unambiguous support for the assembly of 
MS2 virions via a PS-mediated mechanism involving a series of induced-fit viral 
protein interactions with RNA.

Sunlight is known to be a pertinent factor governing the infectivity of 
waterborne viruses in the environment. Sunlight inactivates viruses via 
endogenous inactivation (promoted by absorption of solar light in the UVB range 
by the virus) and exogenous processes (promoted by adsorption of sunlight by 
external chromophores, which subsequently generate inactivating reactive 
species). The extent of inactivation is still difficult to predict, as it 
depends on multiple parameters including virus characteristics, solution 
composition, season and geographical location. In this work, we adapted a model 
typically used to estimate the photodegradation of organic pollutants, APEX, to 
explore the fate of two commonly used surrogates of human viruses (coliphages 
MS2 and ϕX174) in waste stabilization pond and natural surface water. Based on 
experimental data obtained in previous work, we modeled virus inactivation as a 
function of water depth and composition, as well as season and latitude, and we 
apportioned the contributions of the different inactivation processes to total 
inactivation. Model results showed that ϕX174 is inactivated more readily than 
MS2, except at latitudes >60°. ϕX174 inactivation varies greatly with both 
season (20-fold) and latitude (10-fold between 0 and 60°), and is dominated by 
endogenous inactivation under all solution conditions considered. In contrast, 
exogenous processes contribute significantly to MS2 inactivation. Because 
exogenous inactivation can be promoted by longer wavelengths, which are less 
affected by changes in season and latitude, MS2 exhibits smaller fluctuations in 
inactivation throughout the year (10-fold) and across the globe (3-fold between 
0 and 60°) compared to ϕX174. While a full model validation is currently not 
possible due to the lack of sufficient field data, our estimated inactivation 
rates corresponded well to those reported in field studies. Overall, this study 
constitutes a step toward estimating microbial water quality as a function of 
spatio-temporal information and easy-to-determine solution parameters.

of three methods.

University of Westminster, London, UK.

AIMS: To use a MS2 bacteriophage model to compare three hand-drying methods, 
paper towels (PT), a warm air dryer (WAD) and a jet air dryer (JAD), for their 
potential to disperse viruses and contaminate the immediate environment during 
use.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Participants washed their gloved hands with a suspension of 
MS2 bacteriophage and hands were dried with one of the three hand-drying 
devices. The quantity of MS2 present in the areas around each device was 
determined using a plaque assay. Samples were collected from plates containing 
the indicator strain, placed at varying heights and distances and also from the 
air. Over a height range of 0·15-1·65 m, the JAD dispersed an average of >60 and 
>1300-fold more plaque-forming units (PFU) compared to the WAD and PT (P < 
0·0001), respectively. The JAD dispersed an average of >20 and >190-fold more 
PFU in total compared to WAD and PT at all distances tested up to 3 m (P < 0·01) 
respectively. Air samples collected around each device 15 min after use 
indicated that the JAD dispersed an average of >50 and >100-fold more PFU 
compared to the WAD and PT (P < 0·001), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of the JAD lead to significantly greater and further dispersal 
of MS2 bacteriophage from artificially contaminated hands when compared to the 
WAD and PT.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: The choice of hand-drying device should be 
considered carefully in areas where infection prevention concerns are paramount, 
such as healthcare settings and the food industry.

Adsorption to solid-water interfaces is a major process governing the fate of 
waterborne viruses in natural and engineered systems. The relative contributions 
of different interaction forces to adsorption and their dependence on the 
physicochemical properties of the viruses remain, however, only poorly 
understood. Herein, we systematically studied the adsorption of four 
bacteriophages (MS2, fr, GA, and Qβ) to five model surfaces with varying surface 
chemistries and to three dissolved organic matter adlayers, as a function of 
solution pH and ionic strength, using quartz crystal microbalance with 
dissipation monitoring. The viruses were selected to have similar sizes and 
shapes but different surface charges, polarities, and topographies, as 
identified by modeling the distributions of amino acids in the virus capsids. 
Virus-sorbent interactions were governed by long-ranged electrostatics and 
favorable contributions from the hydrophobic effect, and shorter-ranged van der 
Waals interactions were of secondary importance. Steric effects depended on the 
topographic irregularities on both the virus and sorbent surfaces. Differences 
in the adsorption characteristics of the tested viruses were successfully linked 
to differences in their capsid surface properties. Besides identifying the major 
interaction forces, this work highlights the potential of computable virus 
surface charge and polarity descriptors to predict virus adsorption to 
solid-water interfaces.

Studies of gene expression are typically carried out by a molecular analysis 
that averages entire populations of cells in culture, or in a tissue. This 
approach cannot detect cell to cell variability, or collect subcellular 
information, such as spatial distribution. At the transcriptional level, it is 
evident that even a robust transcriptional response in ensemble measurements is 
not uniform among all cells in a population. At the post-transcriptional level, 
mRNAs and proteins can be trafficked to specific sub-cellular compartments 
allowing spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression, but these critical 
spatial relationships are lost with common molecular biology approaches. Through 
direct visualization of mRNA during the biogenesis process and analyzing the 
distribution of single mRNA molecules in cells we have gained a deeper 
understanding of gene expression at many levels. Recent technical advances have 
made these types of analysis more accessible than ever. The utility of this 
approach toward studying transcriptional events is underscored throughout many 
of the articles within this volume. Techniques such as fluorescent in situ 
hybridization (FISH) are being applied to single molecule studies in fixed cells 
with far-reaching results, but they are limited in their ability to provide 
information about the dynamic nature of mRNA in vivo, so methodology to 
visualize single mRNA molecules in living cells has become desirable. In this 
article, we will discuss the state-of-the-art tagging systems used for real-time 
imaging of mRNAs that have been developed. We will present an overview of how 
these approaches have been applied to impacting our view of gene expression.

In eukaryotes, mRNA synthesis is catalyzed by RNA polymerase II and involves 
several distinct steps, including transcript initiation, elongation, cleavage, 
and transcript release. Splicing of RNA can occur during (co-transcriptional) or 
after (post-transcriptional) RNA synthesis. Thus, RNA synthesis and processing 
occurs through the concerted activity of dozens of enzymes, each of which is 
potentially susceptible to perturbation by small molecules. However, there are 
few, if any, high-throughput screening strategies for identifying drugs which 
perturb a specific step in RNA synthesis and processing. Here we have developed 
a high-throughput fluorescence microscopy approach in single cells to screen for 
inhibitors of specific enzymatic steps in RNA synthesis and processing. By 
utilizing the high affinity interaction between bacteriophage capsid proteins 
(MS2, PP7) and RNA stem loops, we are able to fluorescently label the intron and 
exon of a β-globin reporter gene in human cells. This approach allows one to 
measure the kinetics of transcription, splicing and release in both fixed and 
living cells using a tractable, genetically encoded assay in a stable cell line. 
We tested this reagent in a targeted screen of molecules that target chromatin 
readers and writers and identified three compounds that slow transcription 
elongation without changing transcription initiation.

Polychromatic UV irradiation is a common method of pathogen inactivation in the 
water treatment industry. To improve its disinfection efficacy, more information 
on the mechanisms of UV inactivation on microorganisms at wavelengths throughout 
the germicidal UV spectrum, particularly at below 240 nm, is necessary. This 
work examined UV inactivation of bacteriophage MS2, a common surrogate for 
enteric pathogens, as a function of wavelength. The bacteriophage was exposed to 
monochromatic UV irradiation from a tunable laser at wavelengths of between 210 
nm and 290 nm. To evaluate the mechanisms of UV inactivation throughout this 
wavelength range, RT-qPCR (reverse transcription-quantitative PCR) was performed 
to measure genomic damage for comparison with genomic damage at 253.7 nm. The 
results indicate that the rates of RNA damage closely mirror the loss of viral 
infectivity across the germicidal UV spectrum. This demonstrates that genomic 
damage is the dominant cause of MS2 inactivation from exposure to germicidal UV 
irradiation. These findings contrast those for adenovirus, for which MS2 is used 
as a viral surrogate for validating polychromatic UV reactors.

Membrane ageing reduces the quality of the filtered water. Therefore, in order 
to warrant public health, monitoring membrane performances are of utmost 
importance. Reverse osmosis (RO) membranes are generally used to remove viruses 
and salt. However, there is no detailed study demonstrating the impact of aged 
membrane on the rejection of viruses and of membrane integrity indicators. In 
this paper, the impact of hypochlorite induced RO ageing on the rejection of a 
virus surrogate (MS2 phage) and four membrane integrity indicators (salt, 
dissolved organic matter, rhodamine WT and sulphate) was evaluated. Hypochlorite 
exposure was either active (under filtration) or passive (soaking), and the 
changes of the membrane surface chemistry were characterised using several 
autopsy techniques. Under this accelerated ageing condition, the introduction of 
chlorine in the membrane chemistry and the breakage of amide bonds caused an 
increase of the water permeability and a decrease of the virus surrogate's and 
indicators' rejection. Ageing resulted in a more negatively charged membrane and 
also in a higher hydrophobicity, which lead to the adsorption of MS2 phage. 
Despite severe physical membrane damage leading to a reduction of salt rejection 
to 1.2 log (94%), the minimum rejection of MS2 phage stayed on or above 4 log.

oriented columns packed with glass beads: Gravity effects.

The cotransport of clay colloids and viruses in vertically oriented laboratory 
columns packed with glass beads was investigated. Bacteriophages MS2 and ΦX174 
were used as model viruses, and kaolinite (ΚGa-1b) and montmorillonite (STx-1b) 
as model clay colloids. A steady flow rate of Q=1.5 mL/min was applied in both 
vertical up (VU) and vertical down (VD) flow directions. In the presence of 
KGa-1b, estimated mass recovery values for both viruses were higher for VD than 
VU flow direction, while in the presence of STx-1b the opposite was observed. 
However, for all cases examined, the produced mass of viruses attached onto 
suspended clay particles were higher for VD than VU flow direction, suggesting 
that the flow direction significantly influences virus attachment onto clays, as 
well as packed column retention of viruses attached onto suspended clays. KGa-1b 
hindered the transport of ΦX174 under VD flow, while STx-1b facilitated the 
transport of ΦX174 under both VU and VD flow directions. Moreover, KGa-1b and 
STx-1b facilitated the transport of MS2 in most of the cases examined except of 
the case where KGa-1b was present under VD flow. Also, the experimental data 
were used for the estimation of virus surface-coverages and virus surface 
concentrations generated by virus diffusion-limited attachment, as well as virus 
attachment due to sedimentation. Both sedimentation and diffusion limited virus 
attachment were higher for VD than VU flow, except the case of MS2 and STx-1b 
cotransport. The diffusion-limited attachment was higher for MS2 than ΦΧ174 for 
all cases examined.

AIMS: State-of-the-art bioaerosol samplers have poor collection efficiencies for 
ultrafine virus aerosols. This work evaluated the performance of a novel growth 
tube collector (GTC), which utilizes laminar-flow water-based condensation to 
facilitate particle growth, for the collection of airborne MS2 viruses.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Fine aerosols (<500 nm) containing MS2 coliphage were 
generated from a Collison nebulizer, conditioned by a dilution dryer and 
collected by a GTC and a BioSampler. The GTC effectively condensed water vapour 
onto the virus particles, creating droplets 2-5 μm in diameter, which 
facilitated collection. Comparison of particle counts upstream and downstream 
revealed that the GTC collected >93% of the inlet virus particles, whereas the 
BioSampler's efficiency was about 10%. Viable counts of the GTC-collected 
viruses were also one order of magnitude higher than those of the BioSampler (P 
= 0·003).
CONCLUSION: The efficiency of the GTC for the viable collection of MS2 viruses 
exceeds that of industry standard instrument, the BioSampler, by a factor of 
10-100.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study reveals that the GTC is an 
effective collector of viable MS2 aerosols, and concludes the instrument will be 
an effective tool for studying viable virus aerosols and the inhalation risks 
posed by airborne viruses.

F+ RNA coliphages (FRNA) are used to source-track fecal contamination and as 
surrogates for enteric pathogen persistence in the environment. However, the 
environmental persistence of FRNA is not clearly understood and necessitates the 
evaluation of the survival of prototype and environmental isolates of FRNA 
representing all four genogroups in surface waters from the central coast of 
California. Water temperature played a significant role in persistence-all 
prototype and environmental strains survived significantly longer at 10 °C 
compared to 25 °C. Similarly, the availability of host bacterium was found to be 
critical in FRNA survival. In the absence of E. coli F(amp), all prototypes of 
FRNA disappeared rapidly with a D-value (days for one log reduction) of <1.2 d 
from water samples incubated at 25 °C; the longest surviving prototype was SP. 
However, in the presence of the host, the order of persistence at 25 °C was 
QB>MS2>SP>GA and at 10 °C it was QB = MS2>GA>SP. Significant differences in 
survival were observed between prototypes and environmental isolates of FRNA. 
While most environmental isolates disappeared rapidly at 25 °C and in the 
absence of the host, members of genogroups GIII and GI persisted longer with the 
host compared to members of GII and GIV. Consequentially, FRNA based source 
tracking methods can be used to detect phages from recent fecal contamination 
along with those that persist longer in the environment as a result of cooler 
temperatures and increased host presence.

The transport and retention of Escherichia coli and bacteriophages (PRD1, MS2 
and ФX174), as surrogates for human pathogenic bacteria and viruses, 
respectively, were studied in the sand that was amended with several types of 
biochar produced from various feedstocks. Batch and column studies were 
conducted to distinguish between the role of attachment and straining in microbe 
retention during transport. Batch experiments conducted at various solution 
chemistries showed negligible attachment of viruses and bacteria to biochar 
before or after chemical activation. At any given solution ionic strength, the 
attachment of viruses to sand was significantly higher than that of biochar, 
whereas bacteria showed no attachment to either sand or biochar. Consistent with 
batch results, biochar addition (10% w/w) to sand reduced virus retention in the 
column experiments, suggesting a potential negative impact of biochar 
application to soil on virus removal. In contrast, the retention of bacteria was 
enhanced in biochar-amended sand columns. However, elimination of the fine 
fraction (<60μm) of biochar particles in biochar-amended sand columns 
significantly reduced bacteria retention. Results from batch and column 
experiments suggest that land application of biochar may only play a role in 
microbe retention via straining, by alteration of pore size distribution, and 
not via attachment. Consequently, the particle size distribution of biochar and 
sediments is a more important factor than type of biochar in determining whether 
land application of biochar enhances or diminishes microbial retention.

A proof of concept for the label-free detection of bacteriophage MS2, a model 
indicator of microbiological contamination, is validated in this work as a 
porous silicon (pSi) membrane-based electrochemical biosensor. PSi membranes 
were used to afford nanochannel architectures. The sensing mechanism was based 
on the nanochannel blockage caused by MS2 binding to immobilized capture 
antibodies. This blockage was quantified by measuring the oxidation current of 
the electroactive species reaching the electrode surface, by means of 
differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The immunosensor showed a limit of 
detection of 6 pfu/mL in buffer, allowing the detection of MS2 to levels 
commonly found in real-world applications, and proved to be unaffected by matrix 
effects when analyzing MS2 in reservoir water. This platform enables the 
straightforward, direct and sensitive detection of a broad range of target 
analytes and constitutes a promising approach towards the development of 
portable electronic point of sample analysis devices.

The paucity of proper sanitation facilities has contributed to the spread of 
waterborne diseases in many developing countries. The primary goal of this study 
was to demonstrate the feasibility of using a wastewater electrolysis cell (WEC) 
for toilet wastewater disinfection. The treated wastewater was designed to reuse 
for toilet flushing and agricultural irrigation. Laboratory-scale 
electrochemical (EC) disinfection experiments were performed to investigate the 
disinfection efficiency of the WEC with four seeded microorganisms (Escherichia 
coli, Enterococcus, recombinant adenovirus serotype 5, and bacteriophage MS2). 
In addition, the formation of organic disinfection byproducts (DBPs) 
trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAA5) at the end of the EC 
treatment was also investigated. The results showed that at an applied cell 
voltage of +4 V, the WEC achieved 5-log10 reductions of all four seeded 
microorganisms in real toilet wastewater within 60 min. In contrast, chemical 
chlorination (CC) disinfection using hypochlorite [NaClO] was only effective for 
the inactivation of bacteria. Due to the rapid formation of chloramines, less 
than 0.5-log10 reduction of MS2 was observed in toilet wastewater even at the 
highest [NaClO] dosage (36 mg/L, as Cl2) over a 1 h reaction. Experiments using 
laboratory model waters showed that free reactive chlorine generated in situ 
during EC disinfection process was the main disinfectant responsible for the 
inactivation of microorganisms. However, the production of hydroxyl radicals 
[OH], and other reactive oxygen species by the active bismuth-doped TiO2 anode 
were negligible under the same electrolytic conditions. The formation of THMs 
and HAA5 were found to increase with higher applied cell voltage. Based on the 
energy consumption estimates, the WEC system can be operated using solar energy 
stored in a DC battery as the sole power source.

The concentration of MS2 phage as a model RNA virus in river water using a 
combined ferric colloid adsorption and foam separation-based method was 
examined. The MS2 phage concentrations were determined by the plaque-forming 
unit (PFU) method and reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis. 
When ferric colloid adsorption was performed prior to foam separation, MS2 phage 
was effectively removed from river water and concentrated in the generated foam 
within 7 min. The removal efficiency was >99% at the optimum iron and casein 
concentrations of 5 mg-Fe/L and 10 mg/L, respectively. Furthermore, based on the 
analysis of the collected ferric colloid dissolved using deferoxamine, the MS2 
concentration in the colloid-dissolved solution was 190-fold higher than that 
found in raw water according to RT-qPCR analysis. This is a novel method for 
concentrating RNA viruses to facilitate their detection in river water using 
coagulation and foam separation combined with chelate dissolution of ferric 
flocs.

Detection and quantification of pathogens in water is critical for the 
protection of human health and for drinking water safety and security. When the 
pathogen concentrations are low, large sample volumes (several liters) are 
needed to achieve reliable quantitative results. However, most microbial 
identification methods utilize relatively small sample volumes. As a 
consequence, a concentration step is often required to detect pathogens in 
natural waters. Herein, we introduce a novel water sample concentration method 
based on superabsorbent polymer (SAP) beads. When SAP beads swell with water, 
small molecules can be sorbed within the beads, but larger particles are 
excluded and, thus, concentrated in the residual non-sorbed water. To illustrate 
this approach, millimeter-sized poly(acrylamide-co-itaconic acid) (P(AM-co-IA)) 
beads are synthesized and successfully applied to concentrate water samples 
containing two model microorganisms: Escherichia coli and bacteriophage MS2. 
Experimental results indicate that the size of the water channel within water 
swollen P(AM-co-IA) hydrogel beads is on the order of several nanometers. The 
millimeter size coupled with a negative surface charge of the beads are shown to 
be critical in order to achieve high levels of concentration. This new 
concentration procedure is very fast, effective, scalable, and low-cost with no 
need for complex instrumentation.

Adsorption onto solid-water interfaces is a key process governing the fate and 
transport of waterborne viruses. Although negatively charged viruses are known 
to extensively adsorb onto positively charged adsorbent surfaces, virus 
adsorption in such systems in the presence of negatively charged dissolved 
organic matter (DOM) as coadsorbate remains poorly studied and understood. This 
work provides a systematic assessment of the adsorption dynamics of negatively 
charged viruses (i.e., bacteriophages MS2, fr, GA, and Qβ) and polystyrene 
nanospheres onto a positively charged model sorbent surface in the presence of 
varying DOM concentrations. In all systems studied, DOM competitively suppressed 
the adsorption of the viruses and nanospheres onto the model surface. 
Electrostatic repulsion of the highly negatively charged MS2, fr, and the 
nanospheres impaired their adsorption onto DOM adlayers that formed during the 
coadsorption process. In contrast, the effect of competition on overall 
adsorption was attenuated for less-negatively charged GA and Qβ because these 
viruses also adsorbed onto DOM adlayer surfaces. Competition in MS2-DOM 
coadsorbate systems were accurately described by a random sequential adsorption 
model that explicitly accounts for the unfolding of adsorbed DOM. Consistent 
findings for viruses and nanospheres suggest that the coadsorbate effects 
described herein generally apply to systems containing negatively charged 
nanoparticles and DOM.

Infectious airborne microbes, including many pathological microbes that cause 
respiratory infections, are commonly found in medical facilities and constitute 
a serious threat to human health. Thus, an effective method for reducing the 
number of microbes floating in the air will aid in the minimization of the 
incidence of respiratory infectious diseases. Here, we demonstrate that chlorine 
dioxide (ClO2) gas at extremely low concentrations, which has no detrimental 
effects on human health, elicits a strong effect to inactivate bacteria and 
viruses and significantly reduces the number of viable airborne microbes in a 
hospital operating room. In one set of experiments, a suspension of 
Staphylococcus aureus, bacteriophage MS2, and bacteriophage ΦX174 were released 
into an exposure chamber. When ClO2 gas at 0.01 or 0.02 parts per million (ppm, 
volume/volume) was present in the chamber, the numbers of surviving microbes in 
the air were markedly reduced after 120 min. The reductions were markedly 
greater than the natural reductions of the microbes in the chamber. In another 
experiment, the numbers of viable airborne bacteria in the operating room of a 
hospital collected over a 24-hour period in the presence or absence of 0.03 ppm 
ClO2 gas were found to be 10.9 ± 6.7 and 66.8 ± 31.2 colony-forming units/m3 (n 
= 9, p < 0.001), respectively. Taken together, we conclude that ClO2 gas at 
extremely low concentrations (≤0.03 ppm) can reduce the number of viable 
microbes floating in the air in a room. These results strongly support the 
potential use of ClO2 gas at a non-toxic level to reduce infections caused by 
the inhalation of pathogenic microbes in nursing homes and medical facilities.

Virus-like particles (VLPs) are promising molecular structures for the design 
and construction of novel vaccines, diagnostic tools, and gene therapy vectors. 
Size, oligomer assembly and repetitiveness of epitopes are optimal features to 
induce strong immune responses. Several VLP-based vaccines are currently 
licensed and commercialized, and many vaccine candidates are now under 
preclinical and clinical studies. In recent years, the development of 
genetically engineered recombinant VLPs has accelerated the need for new, 
improved downstream processes. In particular, a rapid low cost purification 
process has been identified as a remaining key challenge in manufacturing 
process development. In the present study we set up a size-exclusion 
chromatography-based, scalable purification protocol for the purification of a 
VLP-based influenza A vaccine produced in Escherichia coli. Recombinant VLPs 
derived from the RNA bacteriophage MS2 displaying an epitope from the ectodomain 
of Matrix 2 protein from influenza A virus were produced and purified. The 3 
steps purification protocol uses a recently developed multimodal size-exclusion 
chromatography medium (Capto™ Core 700) in combination with detergent extraction 
and size-exclusion polishing to reach a 89% VLP purity with a 19% yield. The 
combination of this downstream strategy following production in E. coli would be 
suited for production of VLP-based veterinary vaccines targeting livestock and 
companion animals where large amounts of doses must be produced at an affordable 
price.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers 
worldwide. However, the treatment of patients with HCC is particularly 
challenging. Long non-coding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) has been 
identified as a potential suppressor of several types of tumors, but the 
delivery of long RNA remains problematic, limiting its applications. In the 
present study, we designed a novel delivery system based on MS2 virus-like 
particles (VLPs) crosslinked with GE11 polypeptide. This vector was found to be 
fast, effective and safe for the targeted delivery of lncRNA MEG3 RNA to the 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-positive HCC cell lines without the 
activation of EGFR downstream pathways, and significantly attenuated both in 
vitro and in vivo tumor cell growth. Our study also revealed that the targeted 
delivery was mainly dependent on clathrin-mediated endocytosis and MEG3 RNA 
suppresses tumor growth mainly via increasing the expression of p53 and its 
downstream gene GDF15, but decreasing the expression of MDM2. Thus, this vector 
is promising as a novel delivery system and may facilitate a new approach to 
lncRNA based cancer therapy.

Ultraviolet light (UV) combined with peroxy chemicals, such as H2O2 and 
peroxydisulfate (PDS), have been considered potentially highly effective 
disinfection processes. This study investigated the inactivation of Escherichia 
coli, bacteriophage MS2, and Bacillus subtilis spores as surrogates for 
pathogens under UV/H2O2 and UV/PDS conditions, with the aim to provide further 
understanding of UV-based advanced disinfection processes (ADPs). Results showed 
that one additional log of inactivation of E. coli was achieved with 0.3 mM H2O2 
or PDS at 5.2 × 10(-5) Einstein·L(-1) photo fluence (at 254 nm) compared with UV 
irradiation alone. Addition of H2O2 and PDS greatly enhanced the inactivation 
rate of MS2 by around 15 folds and 3 folds, respectively, whereas the 
inactivation of B. subtilis spores was slightly enhanced. Reactive species 
responsible for the inactivation were identified to be •OH, SO4(·-), and CO3(·-) 
based on manipulation of solution conditions. The CT value of each reactive 
species was calculated with respect to each microbial surrogate, which showed 
that the disinfection efficacy ranked as •OH > SO4(·-) > CO3(·-) ≫ 
O2(·-)/HO2(·). A comprehensive dynamic model was developed and successfully 
predicted the inactivation of the microbial surrogates in surface water and 
wastewater matrices. The concepts of UV-efficiency and EE/O were employed to 
provide a cost-effective evaluation for UV-based ADPs. Overall, the present 
study suggests that it will be beneficial to upgrade UV disinfection to UV/H2O2 
ADP for the inactivation of viral pathogens.

Streptococcus thermophilus (St) type III-A CRISPR-Cas system restricts MS2 RNA 
phage and cuts RNA in vitro. However, the CRISPR array spacers match DNA phages, 
raising the question: does the St CRISPR-Cas system provide immunity by erasing 
phage mRNA or/and by eliminating invading DNA? We show that it does both. We 
find that (1) base-pairing between crRNA and target RNA activates 
single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) degradation by StCsm; (2) ssDNase activity is 
confined to the HD-domain of Cas10; (3) target RNA cleavage by the Csm3 RNase 
suppresses Cas10 DNase activity, ensuring temporal control of DNA degradation; 
and (4) base-pairing between crRNA 5'-handle and target RNA 3'-flanking sequence 
inhibits Cas10 ssDNase to prevent self-targeting. We propose that upon phage 
infection, crRNA-guided StCsm binding to the emerging transcript recruits Cas10 
DNase to the actively transcribed phage DNA, resulting in degradation of both 
the transcript and phage DNA, but not the host DNA.

Many of the devastating pandemics and outbreaks of the 20th and 21st centuries 
have involved enveloped viruses, including influenza, HIV, SARS, MERS, and 
Ebola. However, little is known about the presence and fate of enveloped viruses 
in municipal wastewater. Here, we compared the survival and partitioning 
behavior of two model enveloped viruses (MHV and ϕ6) and two nonenveloped 
bacteriophages (MS2 and T3) in raw wastewater samples. We showed that MHV and ϕ6 
remained infective on the time scale of days. Up to 26% of the two enveloped 
viruses adsorbed to the solid fraction of wastewater compared to 6% of the two 
nonenveloped viruses. Based on this partitioning behavior, we assessed and 
optimized methods for recovering enveloped viruses from wastewater. Our 
optimized ultrafiltration method resulted in mean recoveries (±SD) of 25.1% 
(±3.6%) and 18.2% (±9.5%) for the enveloped MHV and ϕ6, respectively, and mean 
recoveries of 55.6% (±16.7%) and 85.5% (±24.5%) for the nonenveloped MS2 and T3, 
respectively. A maximum of 3.7% of MHV and 2% of MS2 could be recovered from the 
solids. These results shed light on the environmental fate of an important group 
of viruses and the presented methods will enable future research on enveloped 
viruses in water environments.

Symmetry-adapted digital modeling III. Coarse-grained icosahedral viruses.

NL-6525 AJ Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

Considered is the coarse-grained modeling of icosahedral viruses in terms of a 
three-dimensional lattice (the digital modeling lattice) selected among the 
projected points in space of a six-dimensional icosahedral lattice. Backbone 
atomic positions (Cα's for the residues of the capsid and phosphorus atoms P for 
the genome nucleotides) are then indexed by their nearest lattice point. This 
leads to a fine-grained lattice point characterization of the full viral chains 
in the backbone approximation (denoted as digital modeling). Coarse-grained 
models then follow by a proper selection of the indexed backbone positions, 
where for each chain one can choose the desired coarseness. This approach is 
applied to three viruses, the Satellite tobacco mosaic virus, the bacteriophage 
MS2 and the Pariacoto virus, on the basis of structural data from the Brookhaven 
Protein Data Bank. In each case the various stages of the procedure are 
illustrated for a given coarse-grained model and the corresponding indexed 
positions are listed. Alternative coarse-grained models have been derived and 
compared. Comments on related results and approaches, found among the very large 
set of publications in this field, conclude this article.

We evaluated the removal of enteric adenovirus (AdV) type 40 and poliovirus (PV) 
type 1 by coagulation, using water samples from 13 water sources for drinking 
water treatment plants in Japan. The behaviors of two widely accepted enteric 
virus surrogates, bacteriophages MS2 and φX174, were compared with the behaviors 
of AdV and PV. Coagulation with polyaluminum chloride (PACl, basicity 1.5) 
removed AdV and PV from virus-spiked source waters: the infectious AdV and PV 
removal ratios evaluated by means of a plaque-forming-unit method were 
0.1-1.4-log10 and 0.5-2.4-log10, respectively. A nonsulfated high-basicity PACl 
(basicity 2.1) removed infectious AdV and PV more efficiently than did other 
commercially available PACls (basicity 1.5-2.1), alum, and ferric chloride. The 
MS2 removal ratios tended to be larger than those of AdV and PV, partly because 
of differences in the hydrophobicities of the virus particles and the 
sensitivity of the virus to the virucidal activity of PACl; the differences in 
removal ratios were not due to differences in the surface charges of the virus 
particles. MS2, which was more hydrophobic than the other viruses, was 
inactivated during coagulation with PACl. Therefore, MS2 does not appear to be 
an appropriate surrogate for AdV and PV during coagulation. In contrast, because 
φX174, like AdV and PV, was not inactivated during coagulation, and because the 
hydrophobicity of φX174 was similar to or somewhat lower than the 
hydrophobicities of AdV and PV, the φX174 removal ratios tended to be similar to 
or somewhat smaller than those of the enteric viruses. Therefore, φX174 is a 
potential conservative surrogate for AdV and PV during coagulation. In summary, 
the surface hydrophobicity of virus particles and the sensitivity of the virus 
to the virucidal activity of the coagulant are probably important determinants 
of the efficiency of virus removal during coagulation.

Using RNA-coat protein crosslinking we have shown that the principal RNA 
recognition surface on the interior of infectious MS2 virions overlaps with the 
known peptides that bind the high affinity translational operator, TR, within 
the phage genome. The data also reveal the sequences of genomic fragments in 
contact with the coat protein shell. These show remarkable overlap with previous 
predictions based on the hypothesis that virion assembly is mediated by multiple 
sequences-specific contacts at RNA sites termed Packaging Signals (PSs). These 
PSs are variations on the TR stem-loop sequence and secondary structure. They 
act co-operatively to regulate the dominant assembly pathway and ensure cognate 
RNA encapsidation. In MS2, they also trigger conformational change in the 
dimeric capsomere creating the A/B quasi-conformer, 60 of which are needed to 
complete the T=3 capsid. This is the most compelling demonstration to date that 
this ssRNA virus, and by implications potentially very many of them, assemble 
via a PS-mediated assembly mechanism.

The spread of virus-induced infectious diseases through airborne routes of 
transmission is a global concern for economic and medical reasons. To study 
virus transmission, it is essential to have an effective aerosol collector such 
as the growth tube collector (GTC) system that utilizes water-based condensation 
for collecting virus-containing aerosols. In this work, we characterized the GTC 
system using bacteriophage MS2 as a surrogate for a small RNA virus. We 
investigated using RNA extraction and reverse transcription- polymerase chain 
reaction (RT-PCR) to study the total virus collection efficiency of the GTC 
system. Plaque assays were also used to enumerate viable viruses collected by 
the GTC system compared to that by a commercially available apparatus, the SKC® 
Biosampler. The plaque assay counts were used to enumerate viable viruses 
whereas RT-PCR provides a total virus count, including those viruses inactivated 
during collection. The effects of relative humidity (RH) and other conditions on 
collection efficiency were also investigated. Our results suggest that the GTC 
has a collection efficiency for viable viruses between 0.24 and 1.8% and a total 
virus collection efficiency between 18.3 and 79.0%, which is 1-2 orders of 
magnitude higher than that of the SKC® Biosampler. Moreover, higher RH 
significantly increases both the viable and total collection efficiency of the 
GTC, while its effect on the collection efficiency of the SKC® Biosampler is not 
significant.

To gain insight into the potential for aerosolization of viruses in wastewater 
systems, we investigated the partitioning of MS2 and Phi6 bacteriophages in 
synthetic sludge and anaerobically digested sludge from a wastewater treatment 
plant. We evaluated partitioning among the liquid, solids, and material surfaces 
of porcelain, concrete, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polypropylene. In all 
cases, at least 94% of the virions partitioned into the liquid fraction. In real 
sludge, no more than 0.8% of virions partitioned to the solids and no more than 
6% to the material surface. Both MS2 and Phi6 partitioned more to the surface of 
concrete and polypropylene than to the surface of porcelain or PVC. Partitioning 
of viruses in wastewater among the liquid, biosolids, and material surface does 
not appear to mitigate the potential for aerosolization of virus, as most of the 
virus remains in the liquid phase.

RNA is a key player in the process of gene expression. Whereas fluorescence in 
situ hybridization allows single mRNA imaging in fixed cells, the MS2-GFP 
labeling technique enables the observation of mRNA dynamics in living cells. 
Recently, two genetically engineered mouse models have been developed for the 
application of the MS2-GFP system in live animals. First, the Actb-MBS mouse was 
generated by knocking in 24 repeats of the MS2 stem-loop sequence in the 3' 
untranslated region of the β-actin gene. Second, the MCP mouse was made to 
express the NLS-HA-MCP-GFP transgene in all cell types. By crossing Actb-MBS and 
MCP mice, a double homozygous mouse line, MCP×MBS, was established to visualize 
endogenous β-actin mRNA labeled with multiple green fluorescent proteins. By 
imaging hippocampal neurons or brain slices from MCP×MBS mice, the dynamics of 
mRNA, such as transcription, transport, and localization, can be studied at 
single mRNA resolution. In this chapter, we explain the basics of MCP×MBS mice 
and describe methods for utilizing these animals.

Intracellular trafficking and asymmetric localization of RNA molecules within 
cells are a prevalent process across phyla involved in developmental control and 
signaling and thus in the determination of cell fate. In addition to 
intracellular localization, plants support the trafficking of RNA molecules also 
between cells through plasmodesmata (PD), which has important roles in the 
cell-to-cell and systemic communication during plant growth and development. 
Viruses have developed strategies to exploit the underlying plant RNA transport 
mechanisms for the cell-to-cell and systemic dissemination of infection. In vivo 
RNA visualization methods have revolutionized the study of RNA dynamics in 
living cells. However, their application in plants is still in its infancy. To 
gain insights into the RNA transport mechanisms in plants, we study the 
localization and transport of Tobacco mosaic virus RNA using MS2 tagging. This 
technique involves the tagging of the RNA of interest with repeats of an RNA 
stem-loop (SL) that is derived from the origin of assembly of the bacteriophage 
MS2 and recruits the MS2 coat protein (MCP). Thus, expression of MCP fused to a 
fluorescent marker allows the specific visualization of the SL-carrying RNA. 
Here we describe a detailed protocol for Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated 
transient expression and in vivo visualization of MS2-tagged mRNAs in Nicotiana 
benthamiana leaves.

Dynamic regulation of RNA molecules is critical to the survival and development 
of cells. Messenger RNAs are transcribed in the nucleus as intron-containing 
pre-mRNAs and bound by RNA-binding proteins, which control their fate by 
regulating RNA stability, splicing, polyadenylation, translation, and cellular 
localization. Most RBPs have distinct mRNA-binding and functional domains; thus, 
the function of an RBP can be studied independently of RNA-binding by 
artificially recruiting the RBP to a reporter RNA and then measuring the effect 
of RBP recruitment on reporter splicing, stability, translational efficiency, or 
intracellular trafficking. These tethered function assays therefore do not 
require prior knowledge of the RBP's endogenous RNA targets or its binding sites 
within these RNAs. Here, we provide an overview of the experimental strategy and 
the strengths and limitations of common tethering systems. We illustrate 
specific examples of the application of the assay in elucidating the function of 
various classes of RBPs. We also discuss how classic tethering assay approaches 
and insights gained from them have been empowered by more recent technological 
advances, including efficient genome editing and high-throughput RNA-sequencing.

Treatment of human excreta and animal manure (HEAM) is key in controlling the 
spread of persistent enteric pathogens, such as viruses. The extent of virus 
inactivation during HEAM storage and treatment appears to vary with virus genome 
type, although the reasons for this variability are not clear. Here, we 
investigated the inactivation of viruses of different genome types under 
conditions representative of HEAM storage or mesophilic digestion. The goals 
were to characterize the influence of HEAM solution conditions on inactivation 
and to determine the potential mechanisms involved. Specifically, eight viruses 
representing the four viral genome types (single-stranded RNA [ssRNA], 
double-stranded RNA [dsRNA], single-stranded DNA [ssDNA], and double-stranded 
DNA [dsDNA]) were exposed to synthetic solutions with well-controlled 
temperature (20 to 35°C), pH (8 to 9), and ammonia (NH3) concentrations (0 to 40 
mmol liter(-1)). DNA and dsRNA viruses were considerably more resistant than 
ssRNA viruses, resulting in up to 1,000-fold-longer treatment times to reach a 
4-log inactivation. The apparently slower inactivation of DNA viruses was 
rationalized by the higher stability of DNA than that of ssRNA in HEAM. Pushing 
the system toward harsher pH (>9) and temperature (>35°C) conditions, such as 
those encountered in thermophilic digestion and alkaline treatments, led to more 
consistent inactivation kinetics among ssRNA and other viruses. This suggests 
that the dependence of inactivation on genome type disappeared in favor of 
protein-mediated inactivation mechanisms common to all viruses. Finally, we 
recommend the use of MS2 as a conservative indicator to assess the inactivation 
of ssRNA viruses and the stable ΦX174 or dsDNA phages as indicators for 
persistent viruses.
IMPORTANCE: Viruses are among the most environmentally persistent pathogens. 
They can be present in high concentrations in human excreta and animal manure 
(HEAM). Therefore, appropriate treatment of HEAM is important prior to its reuse 
or discharge into the environment. Here, we investigated the factors that 
determine the persistence of viruses in HEAM, and we determined the main 
mechanisms that lead to their inactivation. Unlike other organisms, viruses can 
have four different genome types (double- or single-stranded RNA or DNA), and 
the viruses studied herein represent all four types. Genome type appeared to be 
the major determinant for persistence. Single-stranded RNA viruses are the most 
labile, because this genome type is susceptible to degradation in HEAM. In 
contrast, the other genome types are more stable; therefore, inactivation is 
slower and mainly driven by the degradation of viral proteins. Overall, this 
study allows us to better understand the behavior of viruses in HEAM.

The differences in physicochemical characteristics between infectious and 
non-infectious viral particles are poorly known. Even for heat, which is known 
as one of the most efficient treatments to inactivate enteric viruses, the 
global inactivation mechanisms have not been described yet. Such knowledge would 
help distinguish between both types of particles and therefore clarify the 
interpretation of the presence of viral genomes in food after heat treatment. In 
this study, we examined in particular the differences in electrostatic charge 
and hydrophobicity between the two particle types. MS2 phage, a common surrogate 
for enteric viruses, was used as a model virus. The heat-induced inactivation 
process of the infectious phages caused hydrophobic domains to be transiently 
exposed and their charge to become less negative. The particles also became 
progressively permeable to small molecules such as SYPRO Orange dye. The 
presence of non-infectious phage particles in which the genome was not 
accessible to RNases has been clearly demonstrated. These observations were done 
for MS2 phages exposed to a temperature of 60 °C. When exposed to a temperature 
higher than their critical temperature (72 °C), the particles were disrupted and 
the genome became available for RNases. At lower temperatures, 60 °C in this 
study, the transient expression of hydrophobic domains of remaining infectious 
phages appeared as an interesting parameter for improving their specific 
detection.

Chlorine disinfection is a globally used method to ensure the safety of drinking 
water. However, it has not always been successful against viruses and, 
therefore, it is important to find new methods to disinfect water. Seventeen 
different coliphages were isolated from the treated municipal wastewater. These 
coliphages and MS2 were treated with different dosages of chlorine in drinking 
water, and a combined chlorine/ultraviolet irradiation treatment for the 
chlorine-resistant coliphages. Chlorine disinfection with 0.3-0.5 mg/L total 
chlorine (free Cl-dosage 0.12-0.21 mg/L) for 10 min achieved 2.5-5.7 
Log10-reductions for 11 sensitive coliphages. The six most resistant coliphages 
showed no reduction with these chlorine concentrations. MS2 was intermediate in 
chlorine resistance, and thus it is not a good indicator for viruses in chlorine 
disinfection. In the combined treatment total chlorine of 0.05-0.25 mg/L (free 
Cl-dosage 0.02-0.08 mg/L) and ultraviolet irradiation (14-22 mWs/cm(2)) were 
more effective than chlorine alone, and 3-5 Log10-reductions were achieved for 
the chlorine-resistant strains. The chlorination efficiency could be increased 
by higher dosages and longer contact times, but this could increase the 
formation of disinfection by-products. Therefore, the combination treatment is a 
recommended disinfection method.

The allosteric switching mechanism in bacteriophage MS2.

We use all-atom simulations to elucidate the mechanisms underlying 
conformational switching and allostery within the coat protein of the 
bacteriophage MS2. Assembly of most icosahedral virus capsids requires that the 
capsid protein adopts different conformations at precise locations within the 
capsid. It has been shown that a 19 nucleotide stem loop (TR) from the MS2 
genome acts as an allosteric effector, guiding conformational switching of the 
coat protein during capsid assembly. Since the principal conformational changes 
occur far from the TR binding site, it is important to understand the molecular 
mechanism underlying this allosteric communication. To this end, we use all-atom 
simulations with explicit water combined with a path sampling technique to 
sample the MS2 coat protein conformational transition, in the presence and 
absence of TR-binding. The calculations find that TR binding strongly alters the 
transition free energy profile, leading to a switch in the favored conformation. 
We discuss changes in molecular interactions responsible for this shift. We then 
identify networks of amino acids with correlated motions to reveal the mechanism 
by which effects of TR binding span the protein. We find that TR binding 
strongly affects residues located at the 5-fold and quasi-sixfold interfaces in 
the assembled capsid, suggesting a mechanism by which the TR binding could 
direct formation of the native capsid geometry. The analysis predicts amino 
acids whose substitution by mutagenesis could alter populations of the 
conformational substates or their transition rates.

Current treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have shown inadequate. 
MicroRNA-122 (miR-122) mediated RNA interference brings new prospects. A safe, 
efficient miRNA delivery system is an indispensable assurance. Previously, we 
developed an MS2 bacteriophage virus-like particle (VLP)-based microRNA delivery 
system crosslinked with the HIV TAT peptide, which served as an effective 
inhibitor in the treatments of systemic lupus erythematosus and osteoporosis. 
However, defects, such as low crosslinking efficiency, high cost, and potential 
toxicity of the crosslinking agent, needed to be confronted. Therefore, TAT 
peptide was designed to display on the surface of MS2 VLPs, instead of being 
chemically crosslinked, using the platform of phage surface display. The results 
reflected that MS2 VLPs displaying TAT could effectively penetrate the 
cytomembrane and deliver miR-122. Additionally, its inhibitory effects on HCC 
were significant in Hep3B, HepG2, and Huh7 cells and Hep3B related animal 
models. Thus, we have established a novel miR-122 delivery system based on MS2 
VLPs surface displaying TAT peptide, which could effectively perform the 
function of penetrating cytomembrane and the inhibition of HCC.

AIMS: This work aimed to assess at pilot scale the effect of chlorination and 
water flushing on 2-month-old drinking water biofilms and, above all, on 
biofilm-associated F-specific RNA bacteriophages MS2, GA and Qβ.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Chlorination (4 mg l(-1) ) was applied first with a 
hydrodynamic shear stress of 1 Pa and second with an increase in hydrodynamic 
shear stress to 10 Pa. Despite a rapid decrease in the number of biofilm 
bacteria and associated phages, infectious phages were still detected on 
surfaces after completion of the 150 min cleaning procedure. The resulting 
sequence of phage removal was: GA > Qβ ≫ MS2.
CONCLUSIONS: The effect of chlorine on biofilm bacteria and biofilm-associated 
phages was limited to the upper layers of the biofilm and was not enhanced by an 
increase in hydrodynamic shear stress. A smaller decrease was observed for MS2 
than for GA or Qβ after completion of the cleaning procedure.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The differences observed between the three 
phages suggest that the location of the viral particles in the biofilm, which is 
related to their surface properties, affects the efficiency of chlorine 
disinfection.

Opportunistic bacteria and viruses are a worldwide health threat prompting the 
need to develop new targeting modalities. A class of novel synthetic 
poly(phenylene ethynylene) (PPE)-based oligomeric conjugated polyelectrolytes 
(OPEs) have demonstrated potent wide-spectrum biocidal activity. A subset of 
cationic OPEs display high antiviral activity against the MS2 bacteriophage. The 
oligomers have been found to inactivate the bacteriophage and perturb the 
morphology of the MS2 viral capsid. However, details of the initial binding and 
interactions between the OPEs and the viruses are not well understood. In this 
study, we use a multiscale computational approach, including random sampling, 
molecular dynamics, and electronic structure calculations, to gain an 
understanding of the molecular-level interactions of a series of OPEs that vary 
in length, charge, and functional groups with the MS2 capsid. Our results show 
that OPEs strongly bind to the MS2 capsid protein assembly with binding energies 
of up to -30 kcal/mol. Free-energy analysis shows that the binding is dominated 
by strong van der Waals interactions between the hydrophobic OPE backbone and 
the capsid surface and strong electrostatic free energy contributions between 
the OPE charged moieties and charged residues on the capsid surface. This 
knowledge provides molecular-level insight into how to tailor the OPEs to 
optimize viral capsid disruption and increase OPE efficacy to target amphiphilic 
protein coats of icosahedral-based viruses.

OBJECTIVE Ebola virus disease (EVD) places healthcare personnel (HCP) at high 
risk for infection during patient care, and personal protective equipment (PPE) 
is critical. Protocols for EVD PPE doffing have not been validated for 
prevention of viral self-contamination. Using surrogate viruses (non-enveloped 
MS2 and enveloped Φ6), we assessed self-contamination of skin and clothes when 
trained HCP doffed EVD PPE using a standardized protocol. METHODS A total of 15 
HCP donned EVD PPE for this study. Virus was applied to PPE, and a trained 
monitor guided them through the doffing protocol. Of the 15 participants, 10 
used alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) for glove and hand hygiene and 5 used 
hypochlorite for glove hygiene and ABHR for hand hygiene. Inner gloves, hands, 
face, and scrubs were sampled after doffing. RESULTS After doffing, MS2 virus 
was detected on the inner glove worn on the dominant hand for 8 of 15 
participants, on the non-dominant inner glove for 6 of 15 participants, and on 
scrubs for 2 of 15 participants. All MS2 on inner gloves was observed when ABHR 
was used for glove hygiene; none was observed when hypochlorite was used. When 
using hypochlorite for glove hygiene, 1 participant had MS2 on hands, and 1 had 
MS2 on scrubs. CONCLUSIONS A structured doffing protocol using a trained monitor 
and ABHR protects against enveloped virus self-contamination. Non-enveloped 
virus (MS2) contamination was detected on inner gloves, possibly due to higher 
resistance to ABHR. Doffing protocols protective against all viruses need to 
incorporate highly effective glove and hand hygiene agents. Infect Control Hosp

Bacterial protein compartments concentrate and sequester enzymes, thereby 
regulating biochemical reactions. Here, we generated a new functional 
nanocompartment in Escherichia coli by engineering the MS2 phage capsid protein 
to encapsulate multiple cargo proteins. Sequestration of multiple proteins in 
MS2-based capsids was achieved by SpyTag/SpyCatcher protein fusions that 
covalently crosslinked with the interior surface of the capsid. Further, the 
functional two-enzyme indigo biosynthetic pathway could be targeted to the 
engineered capsids, leading to a 60 % increase in indigo production in vivo. The 
enzyme-loaded particles could be purified in their active form and showed 
enhanced long-term stability in vitro (about 95 % activity after seven days) 
compared with free enzymes (about 5 % activity after seven days). In summary, 
this engineered in vivo encapsulation system provides a simple and versatile way 
for generating highly stable multi-enzyme nanoreactors for in vivo and in vitro 
applications.

The purpose of this study was to validate the use of adenosine triphosphate 
(ATP) for evaluating hygiene intervention effectiveness in reducing viral 
dissemination in an office environment. The bacterial virus MS-2 was used to 
evaluate two scenarios, one where the hand of an individual was contaminated and 
another where a fomite was contaminated. MS-2 was selected as a model because 
its shape and size are similar to many human pathogenic viruses. Two separate 
experiments were conducted, one in which the entrance door push plate was 
inoculated and the other in which the hand of one selected employee was 
inoculated. In both scenarios, 54 selected surfaces in the office were tested to 
assess the dissemination of the virus within the office. Associated surface 
contamination was also measured employing an ATP meter. More than half of the 
tested hands and surfaces in the office were contaminated with MS-2 within 4 h. 
Next, an intervention was conducted, and each scenario was repeated. Half of the 
participating employees were provided hand sanitizer, facial tissues, and 
disinfecting wipes, and were instructed in their use. A significant (p < 0.05) 
reduction was observed in the number of surfaces contaminated with virus. This 
reduction in viral spread was evident from the results of both viral culture and 
the surface ATP measurements, although there was no direct correlation between 
ATP measurements with respect to viral concentration. Although ATP does not 
measure viruses, these results demonstrate that ATP measurements could be useful 
for evaluating the effectiveness of hygiene interventions aimed at preventing 
viral spread in the workplace.

Virus-like particles are used to encapsulate drugs, imaging agents, enzymes, and 
other biologically active molecules in order to enhance their function. However, 
the size of most virus-like particles is inflexible, precluding the design of 
appropriately sized containers for different applications. Here, we describe a 
chromatographic selection for virus-like particle assembly. Using this 
selection, we identified a single amino acid substitution to the coat protein of 
bacteriophage MS2 that mediates a uniform switch in particle geometry from T = 3 
to T = 1 icosahedral symmetry. The resulting smaller particle retains the 
ability to be disassembled and reassembled in vitro and to be chemically 
modified to load cargo into its interior cavity. The pair of 27 and 17 nm MS2 
particles will allow direct examination of the effect of size on function in 
established applications of virus-like particles, including drug delivery and 
imaging.

In single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses, virus capsid assembly and 
genome packaging are intertwined processes. Using cryo-electron microscopy and 
single particle analysis we determined the asymmetric virion structure of 
bacteriophage MS2, which includes 178 copies of the coat protein, a single copy 
of the A-protein and the RNA genome. This reveals that in situ, the viral RNA 
genome can adopt a defined conformation. The RNA forms a branched network of 
stem-loops that almost all allocate near the capsid inner surface, while 
predominantly binding to coat protein dimers that are located in one-half of the 
capsid. This suggests that genomic RNA is highly involved in genome packaging 
and virion assembly.

In the present study, the bactericidal and virucidal mechanisms in the alkaline 
disinfection of compost with calcium lime and ash were investigated. Two 
indicator microorganisms, Escherichia coli and MS2 coliphage, were used as 
surrogates for enteric pathogens. The alkaline-treated compost with calcium 
oxide (CaO) or ash resulted primarily in damage to the outer membrane and enzyme 
activities of E. coli. The alkaline treatment of compost also led to the 
infectivity loss of the coliphage because of the partial capsid damage and RNA 
exteriorization due to a raised pH, which is proportional to the amount of 
alkaline agents added. These results indicate that the alkaline treatment of 
compost using calcium oxide and ash is effective and can contribute to the safe 
usage of compost from a mixing type dry toilet.

AIMS: The purpose of this study was to establish inactivation decay constants of 
foodborne pathogens and coliphage in clay and sandy soils for future 
"downstream" analyses such as quantitative microbial risk analysis and to 
compare cultivation-dependent and -independent (e.g. qPCR) methods.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Salmonella enterica, Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria 
monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O157:H7, and Clostridium perfringens, were 
seeded together with MS2 and ØX174 phages, into three waste matrices (Class B 
biosolids, swine lagoon effluent, cattle manure), and phosphate buffered saline 
(PBS) as a control, and applied to two soil types (sandy loam, clay loam) using 
two management practices (incorporated, surface applied). S. enterica and L. 
monocytogenes inactivation rates were positively affected (e.g. slower rate) by 
solid wastes, while C. jejuni was quickly inactivated by day 7 regardless of 
waste type. The use of qPCR provided more conservative inactivation rates, with 
qPCR-based rates typically twice as slow as cultivation-based. The effect of 
soil type and management were less apparent as rates were variably affected. For 
instance, incorporation of waste negatively impacted (e.g. faster rate) 
inactivation of Salmonella when measured by qPCR, while the opposite was true 
when measured by cultivation. Inactivation rates were 
organism∗waste∗soil∗management dependent since the interactions of these main 
effects significantly affected most combinations.
CONCLUSIONS: Class B biosolids and cattle manure most often slowed inactivation 
when measured by cultivation, but the complex interactions between variables and 
organism made sweeping conclusions difficult. On the contrary 
cultivation-independent inactivation rates were negatively affected by solid 
wastes. Inactivation rates developed by cultivation-dependent and -independent 
assays needs further scrutiny as interprerations can vary by orders of magnitude 
depending on the organism∗environment combination.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study compares decay rate data based 
on waste, soil, management and assay type which can be further used in risk 
assessments.

A variety of nanoscale scaffolds, including virus-like particles (VLPs), are 
being developed for biomedical applications; however, little information is 
available about their in vivo behavior. Targeted nanoparticles are particularly 
valuable as diagnostic and therapeutic carriers because they can increase the 
signal-to-background ratio of imaging agents, improve the efficacy of drugs, and 
reduce adverse effects by concentrating the therapeutic molecule in the region 
of interest. The genome-free capsid of bacteriophage MS2 has several features 
that make it well-suited for use in delivery applications, such as facile 
production and modification, the ability to display multiple copies of targeting 
ligands, and the capacity to deliver large payloads. Anti-EGFR antibodies were 
conjugated to MS2 capsids to construct nanoparticles targeted toward receptors 
overexpressed on breast cancer cells. The MS2 agents showed good stability in 
physiological conditions up to 2 days and specific binding to the targeted 
receptors in in vitro experiments. Capsids radiolabeled with 64Cu isotopes were 
injected into mice possessing tumor xenografts, and both positron emission 
tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) and scintillation counting of the organs 
ex vivo were used to determine the localization of the agents. The capsids 
exhibit surprisingly long circulation times (10-15% ID/g in blood at 24 h) and 
moderate tumor uptake (2-5% ID/g). However, the targeting antibodies did not 
lead to increased uptake in vivo despite in vitro enhancements, suggesting that 
extravasation is a limiting factor for delivery to tumors by these particles.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the pathogen causing hepatitis E (HE). It arouses 
global public health concern since it is a zoonotic disease. The objective of 
this letter is to report a cost-effective internal control prepared for 
monitoring procedures of HEV reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR detection. A 
selected conserved HEV RNA fragment was integrated into the downstream of the 
truncated MS2 bacteriophage genome based on Armored RNA technology. The 
resulting MS2-HEV gene harbored by the pET-28b-MS2-HEV plasmid was transformed 
into E. coli BL21(DE3) for expression analysis by SDS-PAGE. The expression 
products were purified and concentrated by ultrasonication and ultrafiltration 
separation. The morphology and stability properties of the virus-like particles 
(VLPs) were evaluated by electron microscopy scanning and nuclease challenges, 
respectively. SDS-PAGE results showed that the constructed MS2-HEV gene 
expressed efficiently and the purity of the VLPs was highly consistent with the 
result in electron microscopy. Stability evaluation results demonstrated that 
the prepared VLPs exhibited strong resistance to DNase I and RNase A attacks and 
also performed long-lasting protection of coated HEV RNA for at least 4 months 
at -20°C. These data revealed that the prepared VLPs meet the basic requirements 
of use as internal control material in the HEV RNA amplification assay.

MS2 inactivation by UV irradiance was investigated with the focus on how the 
disinfection efficacy is influenced by bacteriophage MS2 aggregation and 
adsorption to particles in solutions with different compositions. Kaolinite and 
Microcystis aeruginosa were used as model inorganic and organic particles, 
respectively. In the absence of model particles, MS2 aggregates formed in either 
1mM NaCl at pH=3 or 50-200mM ionic strength CaCl2 solutions at pH=7 led to a 
decrease in the MS2 inactivation efficacy because the virions located inside the 
aggregate were protected from the UV irradiation. In the presence of kaolinite 
and Microcystis aeruginosa, MS2 adsorbed onto the particles in either 1mM NaCl 
at pH=3 or 50-200mM CaCl2 solutions at pH=7. In contrast to MS2 aggregates 
formed without the presence of particles, more MS2 virions adsorbed on these 
particles were exposed to UV irradiation to allow an increase in MS2 
inactivation. In either 1mM NaCl at pH from 4 to 8 or 2-200mM NaCl solutions at 
pH=7, the absence of MS2 aggregation and adsorption onto the model particles 
explained why MS2 inactivation was not influenced by pH, ionic strength, and the 
presence of model particles in these conditions. The influence of virus 
adsorption and aggregation on the UV disinfection efficiency found in this 
research suggests the necessity of accounting for particles and cation 
composition in virus inactivation for drinking water.

Common water disinfectants like chlorine have been reported to select for 
resistant viruses, yet little attention has been devoted to characterizing 
disinfection resistance. Here, we investigated the resistance of MS2 coliphage 
to inactivation by chlorine dioxide (ClO2). ClO2 inactivates MS2 by degrading 
its structural proteins, thereby disrupting the ability of MS2 to attach to and 
infect its host. ClO2-resistant virus populations emerged not only after 
repeated cycles of ClO2 disinfection followed by regrowth but also after 
dilution-regrowth cycles in the absence of ClO2. The resistant populations 
exhibited several fixed mutations which caused the substitution of ClO2-labile 
by ClO2-stable amino acids. On a phenotypic level, these mutations resulted in a 
more stable host binding during inactivation compared to the wild-type, thus 
resulting in a greater ability to maintain infectivity. This conclusion was 
supported by cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of the virus particle, 
which demonstrated that most structural modification occurred in the putative A 
protein, an important binding factor. Resistance was specific to the 
inactivation mechanism of ClO2 and did not result in significant 
cross-resistance to genome-damaging disinfectants. Overall, our data indicate 
that resistant viruses may emerge even in the absence of ClO2 pressure but that 
they can be inactivated by other common disinfectants.

Although several studies examined the transport of viruses in terrestrial 
systems only few studies exist on the use of marine phages (i.e., nonterrestrial 
viruses infecting marine host bacteria) as sensitively detectable microbial 
tracers for subsurface colloid transport and water flow. Here, we systematically 
quantified and compared for the first time the effects of size, morphology and 
physicochemical surface properties of six marine phages and two coliphages (MS2, 
T4) on transport in sand-filled percolated columns. Phage-sand interactions were 
described by colloidal filtration theory and the extended 
Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek approach (XDLVO), respectively. The phages 
belonged to different families and comprised four phages never used in transport 
studies (i.e., PSA-HM1, PSA-HP1, PSA-HS2, and H3/49). Phage transport was 
influenced by size, morphology and hydrophobicity in an approximate order of 
size > hydrophobicity ≥ morphology. Two phages PSA-HP1, PSA-HS2 (Podoviridae and 
Siphoviridae) exhibited similar mass recovery as commonly used coliphage MS2 and 
were 7-fold better transported than known marine phage vB_PSPS-H40/1. Differing 
properties of the marine phages may be used to trace transport of indigenous 
viruses, natural colloids or anthropogenic nanomaterials and, hence, contribute 
to better risk analysis. Our results underpin the potential role of marine 
phages as microbial tracer for transport of colloidal particles and water flow.

Standardized and rapid assays for viable viral pathogens are needed to inform 
human health risk assessments. Conventional qPCR is designed to enumerate the 
gene copies of an organism in a sample, but does not identify those that 
originated from a viable pathogen. This study was undertaken to evaluate 
modified qPCR methods as infectivity assays for the enumeration of infectious 
MS2 coliphage. Propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment coupled with long-amplicon 
qPCR assays were assessed for their ability to quantify infectious MS2 in pure 
cultures and following inactivation by a range of UV light exposures and 
chlorine doses. The qPCR results were compared to the plaque assay, which was 
used as the standard to indicate the level of infectious MS2 in each sample. For 
pure cultures, PMA-qPCR results were not significantly different from the plaque 
assay (p>0.05). At >4 log inactivation, combined PMA and long-amplicon qPCR 
assays overestimated the level of infectious MS2 remaining (p<0.05). The most 
accurate long-amplicon qPCR infectivity assay targeted a 624-bp region at the 5' 
end of the genome. Modified qPCR approaches may be useful tools to monitor the 
loss of infectivity as a result of disinfection processes.

Antimicrobial electrospun poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) nanofibers were synthesized 
by impregnating benzyl triethylammonium chloride (BTEAC) as an antimicrobial 
agent into PVA nanofibers. The BTEAC-PVA nanofibers were heat-methanol treated 
during the preparation for various tests. The BTEAC-PVA nanofibers became more 
hydrophilic than the PVA nanofibers due to incorporation of BTEAC. Through 
heat-methanol treatment, thermal property, crystallinity, and water stability of 
BTEAC-PVA nanofibers were improved considerably. The immersion test shows that 
heat-methanol treatment has an advantage over heat treatment to maintain BTEAC 
content in BTEAC-PVA nanofibers. The acute toxicity test demonstrates that the 
24-h EC50 and 48-h EC50 values (EC50 = median effective concentration) of BTEAC 
to Daphnia magna were 113 and 90 mg/L, respectively. The leaching test indicates 
that the BTEAC concentration leached from BTEAC-PVA nanofibers was far below the 
concentration affecting the immobilization of D. magna. For antimicrobial 
filtration tests, the BTEAC-PVA nanofibers were deposited onto glass fiber 
filter. The antimicrobial filtration test was conducted against bacteria 
(Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus) and bacteriophages (MS2, PhiX174), 
demonstrating that the BTEAC-PVA nanofibers could enhance the removal of E. coli 
and S. aureus considerably but not the removal of MS2 and PhiX174 under dynamic 
flow conditions.

Hepatitis E virus has been recognised as a food-borne virus hazard in pork 
products, due to its zoonotic properties. This risk can be reduced by adequate 
treatment of the food to inactivate food-borne viruses. We used a spectrum of 
viruses and bacteriophages to evaluate the effect of three food treatments: high 
pressure processing (HPP), lactic acid (LA) and intense light pulse (ILP) 
treatments. On swine liver at 400 MPa for 10 min, HPP gave log10 reductions 
of ≥4.2, ≥5.0 and 3.4 for feline calicivirus (FCV) 2280, FCV wildtype (wt) and 
murine norovirus 1 (MNV 1), respectively. Escherichia coli coliphage ϕX174 
displayed a lower reduction of 1.1, while Escherichia coli coliphage MS2 was 
unaffected. For ham at 600 MPa, the corresponding reductions were 4.1, 4.4, 2.9, 
1.7 and 1.3 log10. LA treatment at 2.2 M gave log10 reductions in the viral 
spectrum of 0.29-2.1 for swine liver and 0.87-3.1 for ham, with ϕX174 and MNV 1, 
respectively, as the most stable microorganisms. The ILP treatment gave log10 
reductions of 1.6-2.8 for swine liver, 0.97-2.2 for ham and 1.3-2.3 for sausage, 
at 15-60 J cm-2, with MS2 as the most stable microorganism. The HPP treatment 
gave significantly (p < 0.05) greater virus reduction on swine liver than ham 
for the viruses at equivalent pressure/time combinations. For ILP treatment, 
reductions on swine liver were significantly (p < 0.05) greater than on ham for 
all microorganisms. The results presented here could be used in assessments of 
different strategies to protect consumers against virus contamination and in 
advice to food producers. Conservative model indicators for the pathogenic 
viruses could be suggested.

Potato peels (PP) contain several bioactive compounds. These compounds are known 
to provide human health benefits, including antioxidant and antimicrobial 
properties. In addition, these compounds could have effects on human enteric 
viruses that have not yet been reported. The objective of the present study was 
to evaluate the phenolic composition, antioxidant properties in the acidified 
ethanol extract (AEE) and water extract of PP, and the antiviral effects on the 
inhibition of Av-05 and MS2 bacteriophages, which were used as human enteric 
viral surrogates. The AEE showed the highest phenolic content and antioxidant 
activity. Chlorogenic and caffeic acids were the major phenolic acids. In vitro 
analysis indicated that PP had a strong antioxidant activity. A 3 h incubation 
with AEE at a concentration of 5 mg/ml was needed to reduce the PFU/ml 
(plaque-forming unit per unit volume) of Av-05 and MS2 by 2.8 and 3.9 log₁₀, 
respectively, in a dose-dependent manner. Our data suggest that PP has potential 
to be a source of natural antioxidants against enteric viruses.

Engineering and study of protein function by directed evolution has been limited 
by the technical requirement to use global mutagenesis or introduce DNA 
libraries. Here, we develop CRISPR-X, a strategy to repurpose the somatic 
hypermutation machinery for protein engineering in situ. Using catalytically 
inactive dCas9 to recruit variants of cytidine deaminase (AID) with MS2-modified 
sgRNAs, we can specifically mutagenize endogenous targets with limited 
off-target damage. This generates diverse libraries of localized point mutations 
and can target multiple genomic locations simultaneously. We mutagenize GFP and 
select for spectrum-shifted variants, including EGFP. Additionally, we mutate 
the target of the cancer therapeutic bortezomib, PSMB5, and identify known and 
novel mutations that confer bortezomib resistance. Finally, using a hyperactive 
AID variant, we mutagenize loci both upstream and downstream of transcriptional 
start sites. These experiments illustrate a powerful approach to create complex 
libraries of genetic variants in native context, which is broadly applicable to 
investigate and improve protein function.

from Escherichia coli to Bacillus subtilis.

The ability to efficiently and reliably transfer genetic circuits between the 
key synthetic biology chassis, such as Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, 
constitutes one of the major hurdles of the rational genome engineering. Using 
lambda Red recombineering we integrated the thermosensitive lambda repressor and 
the lysis genes of several bacteriophages into the E. coli chromosome. The lysis 
of the engineered autolytic cells is inducible by a simple temperature shift. We 
improved the lysis efficiency by introducing different combinations of lysis 
genes from bacteriophages lambda, ΦX174 and MS2 under the control of the 
thermosensitive lambda repressor into the E. coli chromosome. We tested the 
engineered autolytic cells by transferring plasmid and bacterial artificial 
chromosome (BAC)-borne genetic circuits from E. coli to B. subtilis. Our 
engineered system combines benefits of the two main synthetic biology chassis, 
E. coli and B. subtilis, and allows reliable and efficient transfer of DNA 
edited in E. coli into B. subtilis.

The aim of this research was to preliminary track fecal source male-specific 
F+RNA coliphages including human and animals in lettuce. At first, two published 
virus extraction procedures of ultracentrifugation and PEG precipitation were 
compared using DAL assay for determining the recovery efficiency in lettuce 
spiked artificially with three concentrations (102, 104, 106 pfu/100 ml) of MS2 
coliphage. The results showed that PEG precipitation had the highest recovery in 
which the recovery efficiency at the spiked level of 106 pfu/100 ml was 16.63 %. 
Aqueous phase obtained from the final step of PEG method was applied for 
enumeration of coliphage and viral RNA extraction in naturally contaminated 
lettuce samples (N = 30) collected from two sources (market and farm). The 
samples were then analyzed based on (I, II, III, and IV primer sets) using 
RT-PCR method. Coliphages were detected in 9 (60 %) and 12 (80 %) out of 15 
market and farm samples, respectively, using DAL assay, whereas male-specific 
F+RNA coliphages were detected using the RT-PCR method in 9 (60 %) and 13 
(86.6 %) out of 15 samples of market and farm, respectively. Based on the 
results, only genotype I of male-specific F+RNA coliphages was detected in 
lettuce samples and no sample tested was positive for other genotypes (II, III, 
and IV).

Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) offers a 
rapid and sensitive molecular method for detection of enteric viruses. 
Unfortunately, these assays are often hampered by the low virus titre found in 
foods and PCR inhibition due to matrix carryover during RNA extraction. Four 
commercial RNA extraction kits (Qiagen's QIAamp Viral RNA Mini and UltraSens 
Virus kits, MoBio UltraClean Tissue & Cells RNA Isolation kit, and Ambion MagMAX 
Viral RNA Isolation kit) were evaluated for their ability to extract and purify 
MS2 bacteriophage RNA, an enteric virus surrogate, from inoculated green onions, 
a food which has been associated with viral gastroenteritis outbreaks. 
Inoculated green onion wash concentrates and green onion pieces with and without 
Qiagen QIAshredder homogenization were assayed in the kit comparison. MS2 
detection and PCR inhibition were evaluated using a duplex real-time RT-PCR for 
MS2 and an exogenous internal amplification control (IAC) assay. Without 
homogenization, MS2 inoculated at 40pfu/g was detected in at least 4 lots of 
green onion wash concentrates using the silica-membrane spin-column kits. 
Inhibition was a factor for the magnetic silica-based MagMAX kit, which resulted 
in detection of MS2 in 1 of 5. Addition of QIAshredder homogenization prior to 
extraction did not adversely affect the silica-membrane kit results but improved 
the MS2 detection by MagMAX to 5 of 5 lots. Use of a 1:10 dilution of primary 
RNA extracts also improved detection. The QIAamp Viral RNA Mini and MagMAX kits 
were further compared for detection of MS2 from green onion pieces inoculated at 
20 and 5pfu/g. Using homogenization, the MagMAX kit detected 20pfu/g in only 1 
of 2 green onion lots, whereas the QIAamp Viral RNA kit detected 2 of 2 lots at 
5 pfu/g without homogenization.

Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing have led to an explosion in the 
rate of small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) discovery among bacteria. However, only a 
handful of them are functionally characterized. Most of the time, little to no 
targets are known. In Lalaouna et al. (2015), we proposed a new technology to 
uncover sRNAs targetome, which is based on the MS2-affinity purification (MAPS). 
We were able to prove its efficiency by applying it on well-characterized sRNAs 
of Escherichia coli. Thereafter, we adapted the procedure to other kind of RNA 
(mRNAs and tRNA-derived RNA fragments) and bacteria (pathogenic or Gram-positive 
strains). Here, we clearly report all improvements and adjustments made to MAPS 
technology since it was originally reported.

A dual-wavelength UV-C LED unit, emitting at peaks of 260 nm, 280 nm, and the 
combination of 260|280 nm together was evaluated for its inactivation efficacy 
and energy efficiency at disinfecting Escherichia coli, MS2 coliphage, human 
adenovirus type 2 (HAdV2), and Bacillus pumilus spores, compared to conventional 
low-pressure and medium-pressure UV mercury vapor lamps. The dual-wavelength 
unit was also used to measure potential synergistic effects of multiple 
wavelengths on bacterial and viral inactivation and DNA and RNA damage. All five 
UV sources demonstrated similar inactivation of E. coli. For MS2, the 260 nm LED 
was most effective. For HAdV2 and B. pumilus, the MP UV lamp was most effective. 
When measuring electrical energy per order of reduction, the LP UV lamp was most 
efficient for inactivating E. coli and MS2; the LP UV and MP UV mercury lamps 
were equally efficient for HAdV2 and B. pumilus spores. Among the UV-C LEDs, 
there was no statistical difference in electrical efficiency for inactivating 
MS2, HAdV2, and B. pumilus spores. The 260 nm and 260|280 nm LEDs had a 
statistical energy advantage for E. coli inactivation. For UV-C LEDs to match 
the electrical efficiency per order of log reduction of conventional LP UV 
sources, they must reach efficiencies of 25-39% or be improved on by smart 
reactor design. No dual wavelength synergies were detected for bacterial and 
viral inactivation nor for DNA and RNA damage.

In the treatment of household wastewater viruses are hard to eliminate. A new 
technique is described which tackles this major problem. The MS2 (ATCC15597-B1) 
virus was used as a surrogate to estimate the inactivation rates for enteric 
viruses by a hot (150°C) air bubble column evaporator (HBCE) system Its surface 
charging properties obtained by dynamic light scattering, have been studied in a 
range of aqueous salt solutions and secondary treated synthetic sewage water. A 
combination of MS2 virus surface charge properties with thermal inactivation 
rates, and an improved double layer plaque assay technique, allows an assessment 
of the efficiency of the HBCE process for virus removal in water. The system is 
a new energy efficient treatment for water reuse applications.

Reverse transcription, quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is a sensitive method for 
quantification of specific RNA targets, but the first step of the assay, reverse 
transcription, is notoriously variable and sensitive to reaction conditions. In 
this study, we used purified Bacteriophage MS2 genomic RNA as a model virus 
target to test two different RT enzymes (SuperScript II and SuperScript III), 
two RT-priming strategies (gene-specific primers and random hexamers), and 
varying background RNA concentrations (0-50ngμl-1) to determine how these 
variables influence the efficiency of reverse transcription over a range of 
target concentrations (101-107 copies μl-1). The efficiency of the RT reaction 
was greatly improved by increasing both background RNA and primer 
concentrations, but the benefit provided by background RNA was source dependent. 
At a given target concentration, similar RT efficiencies were achieved with 
gene-specific primers and random hexamers, but the latter required much higher 
concentrations. With random hexamers, we observed a systematic variation in RT 
reaction efficiency as a function of target concentration. Using an RNA standard 
curve that was also subject to RT effectively normalized for this systematic 
variability, but the assay accuracy depended critically on the length of the 
standard RNA extending to the 3' end of the qPCR target site. Our results shed 
some light on previous contradictory conclusions in the literature, and provide 
insights that may aid in the design of RT-qPCR assays and the design of 
synthetic RNA standards when full-length material is not available.

Packaging of the genome into a protein capsid and its subsequent delivery into a 
host cell are two fundamental processes in the life cycle of a virus. Unlike 
double-stranded DNA viruses, which pump their genome into a preformed capsid, 
single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses, such as bacteriophage MS2, co-assemble 
their capsid with the genome; however, the structural basis of this co-assembly 
is poorly understood. MS2 infects Escherichia coli via the host 'sex pilus' 
(F-pilus); it was the first fully sequenced organism and is a model system for 
studies of translational gene regulation, RNA-protein interactions, and RNA 
virus assembly. Its positive-sense ssRNA genome of 3,569 bases is enclosed in a 
capsid with one maturation protein monomer and 89 coat protein dimers arranged 
in a T = 3 icosahedral lattice. The maturation protein is responsible for 
attaching the virus to an F-pilus and delivering the viral genome into the host 
during infection, but how the genome is organized and delivered is not known. 
Here we describe the MS2 structure at 3.6 Å resolution, determined by 
electron-counting cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) and asymmetric 
reconstruction. We traced approximately 80% of the backbone of the viral genome, 
built atomic models for 16 RNA stem-loops, and identified three conserved motifs 
of RNA-coat protein interactions among 15 of these stem-loops with diverse 
sequences. The stem-loop at the 3' end of the genome interacts extensively with 
the maturation protein, which, with just a six-helix bundle and a six-stranded 
β-sheet, forms a genome-delivery apparatus and joins 89 coat protein dimers to 
form a capsid. This atomic description of genome-capsid interactions in a 
spherical ssRNA virus provides insight into genome delivery via the host sex 
pilus and mechanisms underlying ssRNA-capsid co-assembly, and inspires 
speculation about the links between nucleoprotein complexes and the origins of 
viruses.

Analysis of Hydroxyl Radicals and Inactivation Mechanisms of Bacteriophage MS2 
in Response to a Simultaneous Application of UV and Chlorine.

The simultaneous application of UV and chlorine (expressed as UV/Cl2) as a water 
treatment method may be a good disinfection option for UV-resistant 
microorganisms, such as human adenoviruses (HAdVs). In this study, we developed 
two approaches using UV/Cl2: one to quantitate the OH• radicals based on the 
degradation of the probe compound para-chlorobenzoic acid (pCBA) and the other 
to use bacteriophage MS2 to understand the virus inactivation mechanisms in 
response to UV, chlorine and UV/Cl2 disinfection using reverse-transcription 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), attachment and genome 
penetration assays. The results revealed that OH• radicals were produced at a 
concentration of 2.70 × 10-14 M in the UV/Cl2 treatment with a practical 
chlorine dose of 1 mg/L and with a minimum UV254 fluence of approximately 10 
mJ/cm2, whereas UV or chlorine alone did not produce OH• radicals. In the UV/Cl2 
treatment, synergistic effects on viral genome damage were observed, but were 
not directly due to OH• radicals. The ability of MS2 to penetrate the genome of 
the host bacteria was impaired, but its ability to attach to the host was not 
affected by the treatment. We concluded that the major cause of virus 
inactivation in response to UV/Cl2 was the damage to the viral genome caused by 
combination actions of chlorine species and OH• radicals.

We examined the removal of representative contaminant candidate list (CCL) 
viruses (coxsackievirus [CV] B5, echovirus type [EV] 11, and hepatitis A virus 
[HAV] IB), recombinant norovirus virus-like particles (rNV-VLPs), and murine 
norovirus (MNV) type 1 by coagulation. Water samples were subjected to 
coagulation with polyaluminum chloride (PACl, basicity 1.5) followed by either 
settling or settling and filtration. Together with our previously published 
results, the removal ratio order, as evaluated by a plaque-forming-unit method 
or an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay after settling, was 
HAV>EV=rNV-VLPs≥CV=poliovirus type 1=MNV>adenovirus type 40 (range, 
0.1-2.7-log10). Infectious HAV was likely inactivated by the PACl and therefore 
was removed to a greater extent than the other viruses. A nonsulfated 
high-basicity PACl (basicity 2.1), removed the CCL viruses more efficiently than 
did two other sulfated PACls (basicity 1.5 or 2.1), alum, or ferric chloride. We 
also examined the removal ratio of two bacteriophages. The removal ratios for 
MS2 tended to be larger than those of the CCL viruses, whereas those for φX174 
were comparable with or smaller than those of the CCL viruses. Therefore, φX174 
may be a useful conservative surrogate for CCL viruses during coagulation.

MazFbs is an mRNA interferase from Bacillus subtilis specifically recognizing 
UACAU. The X-ray structure of its complex with an RNA substrate has been also 
solved. When its amino acid sequence is compared with that of MazFhw, an mRNA 
interferase from a highly halophilic archaeon, recognizing UUACUCA, the 
9-residue loop-1 region is highly homologous except that the V16V17 sequence in 
MazFbs is replaced with TK in MazFhw. Thus, we examined the role of the VV 
sequence in RNA substrate recognition by replacing it with TK, GG, AA or LL. The 
substitution mutants thus constructed showed significant differences in cleavage 
specificity using MS2 phage RNA. The primer extension analysis of the cleavage 
sites revealed that the VV sequence plays an important role in the recognition 
of the 3'-end base of the RNA substrate.

Viral diseases can spread through a variety of routes including aerosols. Yet, 
limited data are available on the efficacy of aerosolized chemicals to reduce 
viral loads in the air. Bacteriophages (phages) are often used as surrogates for 
hazardous viruses in aerosol studies because they are inexpensive, easy to 
handle, and safe for laboratory workers. Moreover, several of these bacterial 
viruses display physical characteristics similar to pathogenic human and animal 
viruses, like morphological size, type of nucleic acids, capsid morphology, and 
the presence of an envelope. In this study, the efficacy of four chemicals was 
evaluated on four airborne phages at two different relative humidity levels. 
Non-tailed bacteriophages MS2 (single-stranded RNA), ϕ6 (double-stranded RNA, 
enveloped), PR772 (double-stranded DNA), and ϕX174 (single-stranded DNA) were 
first aerosolized in a 55L rotative environmental chamber at 19°C with 25% and 
50% relative humidity. Then, hydrogen peroxide, Eugenol (phenylpropene used in 
commercial perfumes and flavorings), Mist® (automobile disinfectant containing 
Triethylene glycol), and Pledge® (multisurface disinfectant containing 
Isopropanol, n-Alkyl Dimethyl Benzyl Amonium Chlorides, and n-Alkyl Dimethyl 
Ethylbenzyl Ammonium Chloride) were nebulized with the phages using a separate 
nebulizer. Aerosols were maintained in suspension during 10 minutes, 1 hour, and 
2 hours. Viral aerosols were sampled using an SKC BioSampler and samples were 
analyzed using qPCR and plaque assays. The resistance levels of the four phages 
varied depending on the relative humidity (RH) and germicidal products tested. 
Phage MS2 was the most stable airborne virus under the environmental conditions 
tested while phage PR772 was the least stable. Pledge® and Eugenol reduced the 
infectivity of all airborne phages tested. At 25% RH, Pledge® and Eugenol were 
more effective at reducing infectivity of RNA phages ϕ6 and MS2. At 50% RH, 
Pledge® was the most effective agent against phage MS2. These findings 
illustrate that various airborne viruses should be tested to demonstrate the 
effectiveness of germicidal treatments. This research also provides a set of 
parameters for testing germicidal products in large-scale settings to reduce the 
risk of virus transmission.

The purpose of this study was to inactivate foodborne pathogens effectively by 
ohmic heating in buffered peptone water and tomato juice without causing 
electrode corrosion and quality degradation. Escherichia coli O157:H7, 
Salmonella Typhimurium, and Listeria monocytogenes were used as representative 
foodborne pathogens and MS-2 phage was used as a norovirus surrogate. Buffered 
peptone water and tomato juice inoculated with pathogens were treated with 
pulsed ohmic heating at different frequencies (0.06-1 kHz). Propidium iodide 
uptake values of bacterial pathogens were significantly (p < 0.05) larger at 
0.06-0.5 kHz than at 1 kHz, and sub-lethal injury of pathogenic bacteria was 
reduced by decreasing frequency. MS-2 phage was inactivated more effectively at 
low frequency, and was more sensitive to acidic conditions than pathogenic 
bacteria. Electrode corrosion and quality degradation of tomato juice were not 
observed regardless of frequency. This study suggests that low frequency pulsed 
ohmic heating is applicable to inactivate foodborne pathogens effectively 
without causing electrode corrosion and quality degradation in tomato juice.

Stem-loop RNA labeling can affect nuclear and cytoplasmic mRNA processing.

The binding of sequence-specific RNA-interacting proteins, such as the 
bacteriophage MS2 or PP7 coat proteins, to their corresponding target sequences 
has been extremely useful and widely used to visualize single mRNAs in vivo. 
However, introduction of MS2 stem-loops into yeast mRNAs has recently been shown 
to lead to the accumulation of RNA fragments, suggesting that the loops impair 
mRNA decay. This result was questioned, because fragment occurrence was mainly 
assessed using ensemble methods, and their cellular localization and its 
implications had not been addressed on a single transcript level. Here, we 
demonstrate that the introduction of either MS2 stem-loops (MS2SL) or PP7 
stem-loops (PP7SL) can affect the processing and subcellular localization of 
mRNA. We use single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) to 
determine the localization of three independent mRNAs tagged with the stem-loop 
labeling systems in glucose-rich and glucose starvation conditions. Transcripts 
containing MS2SL or PP7SL display aberrant localization in both the nucleus and 
the cytoplasm. These defects are most prominent in glucose starvation 
conditions, with nuclear mRNA processing being altered and stem-loop fragments 
abnormally enriching in processing bodies (PBs). The mislocalization of 
SL-containing RNAs is independent of the presence of the MS2 or PP7 coat protein 
(MCP or PCP).

The detection and quantification of enteric RNA viruses is based on isolation of 
viral RNA from the sample followed by quantitative reverse transcription 
polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). To control the whole process of analysis 
and in order to guarantee the validity and reliability of results, process 
control viruses (PCV) are used. The present article describes the process of 
preparation and use of such PCV- MS2 phage-like particles (MS2 PLP) - in RT-qPCR 
detection and quantification of enteric RNA viruses. The MS2 PLP were derived 
from bacteriophage MS2 carrying a unique and specific de novo-constructed RNA 
target sequence originating from the DNA of two extinct species. The amount of 
prepared MS2 particles was quantified using four independent methods - UV 
spectrophotometry, fluorimetry, transmission electron microscopy and a 
specifically developed duplex RT-qPCR. To evaluate the usefulness of MS2 PLP in 
routine diagnostics different matrices known to harbor enteric RNA viruses (swab 
samples, liver tissue, serum, feces, and vegetables) were artificially 
contaminated with specific amounts of MS2 PLP. The extraction efficiencies were 
calculated for each individual matrix. The prepared particles fulfill all 
requirements for PCV - they are very stable, non-infectious, and are genetically 
distinct from the target RNA viruses. Due to these properties they represent a 
good morphological and physiochemical model. The use of MS2 PLP as a PCV in 
detection and quantification of enteric RNA viruses was evaluated in different 
types of matrices.

Identifying the targets of antibody responses during infection is important for 
designing vaccines, developing diagnostic and prognostic tools, and 
understanding pathogenesis. We developed a novel deep sequence-coupled 
biopanning approach capable of identifying the protein epitopes of antibodies 
present in human polyclonal serum. Here, we report the adaptation of this 
approach for the identification of pathogen-specific epitopes recognized by 
antibodies elicited during acute infection. As a proof-of-principle, we applied 
this approach to assessing antibodies to Dengue virus (DENV). Using a panel of 
sera from patients with acute secondary DENV infection, we panned a DENV antigen 
fragment library displayed on the surface of bacteriophage MS2 virus-like 
particles and characterized the population of affinity-selected peptide epitopes 
by deep sequence analysis. Although there was considerable variation in the 
responses of individuals, we found several epitopes within the Envelope 
glycoprotein and Non-Structural Protein 1 that were commonly enriched. This 
report establishes a novel approach for characterizing pathogen-specific 
antibody responses in human sera, and has future utility in identifying novel 
diagnostic and vaccine targets.

A large number of single-stranded RNA viruses assemble their capsid and their 
genomic material simultaneously. The RNA viral genome plays multiple roles in 
this process that are currently only partly understood. In this work, we 
investigated the thermodynamic basis of the role of viral RNA on the assembly of 
capsid proteins. The viral capsid of bacteriophage MS2 was considered as a case 
study. The MS2 virus capsid is composed of 60 AB and 30 CC protein dimers. We 
investigated the effect of RNA stem loop (the translational repressor TR) 
binding to the capsid dimers on the dimer-dimer relative association free 
energies. We found that TR binding results in destabilization of AB 
self-association compared with AB and CC association. This indicates that the 
association of the AB and CC dimers is the most likely assembly pathway for the 
MS2 virus, which explains the experimental observation of alternating patterns 
of AB and CC dimers in dominant assembly intermediates of the MS2 virus. The 
presence of viral RNA, therefore, dramatically channels virus assembly to a 
limited number of pathways, thereby enhancing the efficiency of virus 
self-assembly process. Interestingly, Thr59Ser and Thr45Ala mutations of the 
dimers, in the absence of RNA stem loops, lead to stabilization of AB 
self-association compared with the AB and CC associations, thereby channelling 
virus assembly towards a fivefold (AB)5 pentamer intermediate, providing a 
testable hypothesis of our thermodynamic arguments.

Chlorination has long been used for disinfection of municipal wastewater (MWW) 
effluent while the use peracetic acid (PAA) has been proposed more recently in 
the United States. Previous work has demonstrated the bactericidal effectiveness 
of PAA and monochloramine in wastewater, but limited information is available 
for viruses, especially ones of mammalian origin (e.g., norovirus). Therefore, a 
comparative assessment was performed of the virucidal efficacy of PAA and 
monochloramine against murine norovirus (MNV) and MS2 bacteriophage in secondary 
effluent MWW and phosphate buffer (PB). A suite of inactivation kinetic models 
was fit to the viral inactivation data. Predicted concentration-time (CT) values 
for 1-log10 MS2 reduction by PAA and monochloramine in MWW were 1254 and 1228 
mg-min/L, respectively. The 1-, 2-, and 3-log10 model predicted CT values for 
MNV viral reduction in MWW were 32, 47, and 69 mg-min/L for PAA and 6, 13, and 
28 mg-min/L for monochloramine, respectively. Wastewater treatment plant 
disinfection practices informed by MS2 inactivation data will likely be 
protective for public health but may overestimate CT values for reduction of 
MNV. Additionally, equivalent CT values in PB resulted in greater viral 
reduction which indicate that viral inactivation data in laboratory grade water 
may not be generalizable to MWW applications.

BACKGROUND: Virus-like particles (VLPs) of the RNA bacteriophage MS2 have many 
potential applications in biotechnology. MS2 VLPs provide a platform for peptide 
display and affinity selection (i.e. biopanning). They are also under 
investigation as vehicles for targeted drug delivery, using display of 
receptor-specific peptides or nucleic acid aptamers to direct their binding to 
specific cell-surface receptors. However, there are few molecules more suited to 
the precise targeting and binding of a cellular receptor than antibodies.
RESULTS: Here we describe a strategy for display of four different functional 
single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) on the surface of the MS2 VLP. Each scFv 
is validated both for its presence on the surface of the VLP and for its ability 
to bind its cognate antigen.
CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates the suitability of the MS2 VLP platform to 
display genetically fused scFvs, allowing for many potential applications of 
these VLPs and paving the way for future work with libraries of scFvs displayed 
in a similar manner on the VLP surface. These libraries can then be biopanned 
and novel scFv binders to targets can be readily discovered.

Nuclear RNAs emerge as important factors to orchestrate the dynamic organization 
of the nucleus into functional subcompartments. By tethering RNAs to distinct 
genomic loci, RNA-dependent chromatin changes can be dissected by fluorescence 
microscopic analysis. Here we describe how this approach is implemented in 
mammalian cells. It involves two high-affinity protein-nucleic acid interactions 
that can be established with a number of different protein domains and DNA and 
RNA sequences. A prototypic system is described here in detail: It consists of 
the binding of MS2 bacteriophage coat protein to its RNA recognition sequence 
and the interaction between the bacterial LacI repressor protein to its target 
lacO operator DNA sequence. Via these interactions RNAs tagged with the MS2 
recognition sequences can be recruited to a locus with integrated lacO repeats. 
By inducing RNA-chromatin binding a number of RNA-dependent activities can be 
dissected: (i) The RNA-induced compaction or decondensation of chromatin, (ii) 
identification of RNA-interacting chromatin modifiers that set epigenetic 
signals such as posttranslational histone modifications, and (iii) nuclear 
relocation of a genomic locus targeted by the tethered RNA. Thus, a variety of 
RNA-dependent activities can be evaluated with the MS2-LacI system, which are 
crucial for understanding how RNA shapes nuclear organization.

Viral foodborne outbreaks are a serious threat to public health, and fresh 
produce is becoming increasingly recognized as a transmission vehicle. To limit 
foodborne disease, ready-to-eat leafy greens are typically washed with a 
chlorine-based sanitizer during commercial production. This study assessed the 
efficacy of a chlorine-based sanitizer against coliphage MS2, as a potential 
surrogate for foodborne viruses, on fresh-cut romaine lettuce during simulated 
commercial production using a small-scale processing line. Before processing, 
romaine lettuce was inoculated to contain approximately 105 and 106 PFU/g of MS2 
for experiments with and without sanitizer, respectively. Lettuce samples were 
collected following each stage of processing, which included mechanical 
shredding, 2 min of flume washing (with or without 25 ppm of free chlorine), 
shaker table dewatering, and centrifugal drying. In addition, the spent 
centrifuge water and flume wash water were collected, with the flume water 
concentrated using hollow-fiber ultrafiltration. MS2 was recovered from lettuce 
in Tris-glycine buffer and quantified as PFUs in a double-agar overlay assay. 
The greatest reduction in MS2 occurred between shredding and flume washing, with 
levels remaining relatively stable following flume washing with or without 25 
ppm of free chlorine. Average total reductions of 0.8 and 1.0 log PFU/g were 
seen after processing with and without the sanitizer, respectively, with no 
statistical difference observed between the two treatments (P > 0.05). The 
average MS2 level in the spent centrifugation water started at 4.0 log PFU/ml 
for experiments with sanitizer and the average MS2 reduction in the flume wash 
water was 4 log (PFU) for experiments with sanitizer, demonstrating that 
removals could be achieved in the water itself. These findings suggest that the 
currently recommended commercial production practices are unable to effectively 
decrease viruses once they have attached to leafy greens during commercial 
processing.

Here, we evaluated the efficacy of direct microfiltration (MF) and 
ultrafiltration (UF) to remove three representative human enteric viruses (i.e., 
adenovirus [AdV] type 40, coxsackievirus [CV] B5, and hepatitis A virus [HAV] 
IB), and one surrogate of human caliciviruses (i.e., murine norovirus [MNV] type 
1). Eight different MF membranes and three different UF membranes were used. We 
also examined the ability of coagulation pretreatment with high-basicity 
polyaluminum chloride (PACl) to enhance virus removal by MF. The removal ratios 
of two bacteriophages (MS2 and φX174) and a plant virus (pepper mild mottle 
virus; PMMoV) were compared with the removal ratios of the human enteric viruses 
to assess the suitability of these viruses to be used as surrogates for human 
enteric viruses. The virus removal ratios obtained with direct MF with membranes 
with nominal pore sizes of 0.1-0.22 μm differed, depending on the membrane used; 
adsorptive interactions, particularly hydrophobic interactions between virus 
particles and the membrane surface, were dominant factors for virus removal. In 
contrast, direct UF with membranes with nominal molecular weight cutoffs of 
1-100 kDa effectively removed viruses through size exclusion, and >4-log10 
removal was achieved when a membrane with a nominal molecular weight cutoff of 
1 kDa was used. At pH 7 and 8, in-line coagulation-MF with nonsulfated 
high-basicity PACls containing Al30 species had generally a better virus removal 
(i.e., >4-log10 virus removal) than the other aluminum-based coagulants, except 
for φX174. For all of the filtration processes, the removal ratios of AdV, CV, 
HAV, and MNV were comparable and strongly correlated with each other. The 
removal ratios of MS2 and PMMoV were comparable or smaller than those of the 
three human enteric viruses and MNV, and were strongly correlated with those of 
the three human enteric viruses and MNV. The removal ratios obtained with 
coagulation-MF for φX174 were markedly smaller than those obtained for the three 
human enteric viruses and MNV. However, because MS2 was inactivated after 
contact with PACl during coagulation pretreatment, unlike AdV, CV, MNV, and 
PMMoV, the removal ratios of infectious MS2 were probably an overestimation of 
the ability of coagulation-MF to remove infectious AdV, CV, and caliciviruses. 
Thus, PMMoV appears to be a suitable surrogate for human enteric viruses, 
whereas MS2 and φX174 do not, for the assessment of the efficacy of membrane 
filtration processes to remove viruses.

Virus inactivation by nanoparticles (NPs) is hypothesized to affect virus fate 
and transport in the subsurface. This study examines the interactions of viruses 
with titanium dioxide (TiO2) anatase NPs, which is a good disinfectant with 
unique physiochemical properties. The bacteriophage MS2 was used as a model 
virus. A series of batch experiments of MS2 inactivation by TiO2 NPs were 
conducted at room temperature (25°C), in the presence and absence of quartz 
sand, with and without ambient light. Three sets of experiments were performed 
in phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS) and one in distilled deionized water 
(ddH2O). The virus inactivation experimental data were satisfactorily fitted 
with a pseudo-first order expression with a time dependent rate coefficient. 
Quartz sand was shown to affect MS2 inactivation by TiO2 NPs both in the 
presence and absence of ambient light, because, under the experimental 
conditions of this study, the quartz sand offers a protection to the attached 
MS2 against inactivation. Moreover, it was shown that low TiO2 concentration 
(10mg/L) affected only slightly MS2 inactivation with and without ambient light. 
Furthermore, PBS hindered MS2 inactivation by TiO2 NPs.

In order to assure the microbial safety of drinking water, UVC-LED treatment has 
emerged as a possible technology to replace the use of conventional low pressure 
(LP) mercury vapor UV lamps. In this investigation, inactivation of Human 
Enteric Virus (HuEV) surrogates with UVC-LEDs was investigated in a water 
disinfection system, and kinetic model equations were applied to depict the 
surviving infectivities of the viruses. MS2, Qβ, and ΦX 174 bacteriophages were 
inoculated into sterile distilled water (DW) and irradiated with UVC-LED printed 
circuit boards (PCBs) (266nm and 279nm) or conventional LP lamps. Infectivities 
of bacteriophages were effectively reduced by up to 7-log after 9mJ/cm2 
treatment for MS2 and Qβ, and 1mJ/cm2 for ΦX 174. UVC-LEDs showed a superior 
viral inactivation effect compared to conventional LP lamps at the same dose 
(1mJ/cm2). Non-log linear plot patterns were observed, so that Weibull, 
Biphasic, Log linear-tail, and Weibull-tail model equations were used to fit the 
virus survival curves. For MS2 and Qβ, Weibull and Biphasic models fit well with 
R2 values approximately equal to 0.97-0.99, and the Weibull-tail equation 
accurately described survival of ΦX 174. The level of UV-susceptibility among 
coliphages measured by the inactivation rate constant, k, was statistically 
different (ΦX 174 (ssDNA)>MS2, Qβ (ssRNA)), and indicated that sensitivity to UV 
was attributed to viral genetic material.

The L protein of the single-stranded RNA phage MS2 causes lysis of Escherichia 
coli without inducing bacteriolytic activity or inhibiting net peptidoglycan 
(PG) synthesis. To find host genes required for L-mediated lysis, spontaneous 
Ill (insensitivity to Llysis) mutants were selected as survivors of L expression 
and shown to have a missense change of the highly conserved proline (P330Q) in 
the C-terminal domain of DnaJ. In the dnaJP330Q mutant host, L-mediated lysis is 
completely blocked at 30°C without affecting the intracellular levels of L. At 
higher temperatures (37°C and 42°C), both lysis and L accumulation are delayed. 
The lysis block at 30°C in the dnaJP330Q mutant was recessive and could be 
suppressed by Lovercomes dnaJ (Lodj ) alleles selected for restoration of lysis. 
All three Lodj alleles lack the highly basic N-terminal half of the lysis 
protein and cause lysis ∼20 min earlier than full-length L. DnaJ was found to 
form a complex with full-length L. This complex was abrogated by the P330Q 
mutation and was absent with the Lodj truncations. These results suggest that, 
in the absence of interaction with DnaJ, the N-terminal domain of L interferes 
with its ability to bind to its unknown target. The lysis retardation and DnaJ 
chaperone dependency conferred by the nonessential, highly basic N-terminal 
domain of L resembles the SlyD chaperone dependency conferred by the highly 
basic C-terminal domain of the E lysis protein of ϕX174, suggesting a common 
theme where single-gene lysis can be modulated by host factors influenced by 
physiological conditions.IMPORTANCE Small single-stranded nucleic acid lytic 
phages (Microviridae and Leviviridae) lyse their host by expressing a single 
"protein antibiotic." The protein antibiotics from two out of three prototypic 
small lytic viruses have been shown to inhibit two different steps in the 
conserved PG biosynthesis pathway. However, the molecular basis of lysis caused 
by L, the lysis protein of the third prototypic virus, MS2, is unknown. The 
significance of our research lies in the identification of DnaJ as a chaperone 
in the MS2 L lysis pathway and the identification of the minimal lytic domain of 
MS2 L. Additionally, our research highlights the importance of the highly 
conserved P330 residue in the C-terminal domain of DnaJ for specific protein 
interactions.

The performance of photocatalytic treatment processes were assessed using 
different photocatalysts against E. coli and bacteriophages MS2, ΦX174 and 
PR772, in a recirculating continuous flow compound parabolic collector system 
under real sunlight conditions. Suspended TiO2 and ZnO nanoparticle powders and 
Tris(2,2'-bipyridyl)dichlororuthenium(II) hexahydrate in solution were tested 
separately, as well as in combination, using E. coli. For a 3-log reduction of 
E. coli in distilled water, inactivation rates in terms of cumulative dose were 
in the order Ru(bpy)3Cl2>(TiO2 & Ru(bpy)3Cl2)>(ZnO & 
Ru(bpy)3Cl2)>ZnO>TiO2>photolysis. Reactivation of E. coli was observed following 
all trials despite the detection limit being reached, although the reactivated 
colonies were observed to be under stress and much slower growing when compared 
to original colonies. Treatment with Ru(bpy)3Cl2 was also compared against 
standard photolysis of bacteriophages MS2, ΦX174 and PR772 with the order of 
photolytic inactivation for a 3-log reduction in terms of cumulative UV-A dose 
being ΦX174>PR772>MS2. However, MS2 was found to be the most susceptible 
bacteriophage to treatment with Ru(bpy)3Cl2, with complete removal of the phage 
observed within the first 15min of exposure. Ru(bpy)3Cl2 also significantly 
improved inactivation rates for PR772 and ΦX174.

BACKGROUND: Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) 
is routinely used to detect viral infections. In Brazil, it is mandatory the use 
of nucleic acid tests to detect hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus and 
human immunodeficiency virus in blood banks because of the immunological window. 
The use of an internal control (IC) is necessary to differentiate the true 
negative results from those consequent from a failure in some step of the 
nucleic acid test.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was the construction of virus-modified 
particles, based on MS2 bacteriophage, to be used as IC for the diagnosis of RNA 
viruses.
METHODS: The MS2 genome was cloned into the pET47b(+) plasmid, generating 
pET47b(+)-MS2. MS2-like particles were produced through the synthesis of MS2 RNA 
genome by T7 RNA polymerase. These particles were used as non-competitive IC in 
assays for RNA virus diagnostics. In addition, a competitive control for HCV 
diagnosis was developed by cloning a mutated HCV sequence into the MS2 replicase 
gene of pET47b(+)-MS2, which produces a non-propagating MS2 particle. The 
utility of MS2-like particles as IC was evaluated in a one-step format multiplex 
real-time RT-PCR for HCV detection.
FINDINGS: We demonstrated that both competitive and non-competitive IC could be 
successfully used to monitor the HCV amplification performance, including the 
extraction, reverse transcription, amplification and detection steps, without 
compromising the detection of samples with low target concentrations. In 
conclusion, MS2-like particles generated by this strategy proved to be useful IC 
for RNA virus diagnosis, with advantage that they are produced by a low cost 
protocol. An attractive feature of this system is that it allows the 
construction of a multicontrol by the insertion of sequences from more than one 
pathogen, increasing its applicability for diagnosing different RNA viruses.

Volume reduction (condensation) is a key for the practical usage of human urine 
as a fertilizer because it enables the saving of storage space and the reduction 
of transportation cost. However, concentrated urine may carry infectious disease 
risks resulting from human pathogens frequently present in excreta, though the 
survival of pathogens in concentrated urine is not well understood. In this 
study, the inactivation of MS2 coliphage, a surrogate for single-stranded RNA 
human enteric viruses, in concentrated synthetic urine was investigated. The 
infectious titer reduction of MS2 coliphage in synthetic urine samples was 
measured by plaque assay, and the reduction of genome copy number was monitored 
by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RTqPCR). Among chemical-physical 
conditions such as pH and osmotic pressure, uncharged ammonia was shown to be 
the predominant factor responsible for MS2 inactivation, independently of urine 
concentration level. The reduction rate of the viral genome number varied among 
genome regions, but the comprehensive reduction rate of six genome regions was 
well correlated with that of the infectious titer of MS2 coliphage. This 
indicates that genome degradation is the main mechanism driving loss of 
infectivity, and that RT-qPCR targeting the six genome regions can be used as a 
culture-independent assay for monitoring infectivity loss of the coliphage in 
urine. MS2 inactivation rate constants were well predicted by a model using ion 
composition and speciation in synthetic urine samples, which suggests that MS2 
infectivity loss can be estimated solely based on the solution composition, 
temperature and pH, without explicitly accounting for effects of osmotic 
pressure.

The detection of aerosolized viruses can serve as an important surveillance and 
control tool in agriculture, human health, and environmental settings. Here, we 
adapted an anion exchange resin-based method, initially developed to concentrate 
negatively charged viruses from water, to liquid impingement-based bioaerosol 
sampling. In this method, aerosolized viruses are collected in a 20ml liquid 
sample contained within widely used impingers, BioSamplers (SKC Inc., Eighty 
Four, PA), and further concentrated via adsorption to an anion exchange resin 
that is suspended within this liquid. Viral nucleic acids are then extracted 
from the resin to facilitate molecular analyses through a reduction in the 
effective sample volume. For this study, various quantities of two negatively 
charged viruses, type A and type B influenza viruses (FluMist Quadrivalent 
vaccine) and the male-specific (F+) RNA coliphage MS2 (MS2), were nebulized into 
a custom-built bioaerosolization chamber, and sampled using BioSamplers with and 
without anion exchange resin. Compared to direct testing of the BioSampler 
liquid, detection was improved by 6.77× and 3.33× for type A and type B 
influenza viruses, respectively, by using the anion exchange resin. For MS2, the 
anion exchange resin method allowed for an average improvement in detection of 
8.26×.

Faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) are commonly used as water quality indicators; 
implying faecal contamination and therefore the potential presence of pathogenic 
enteric bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. Hence in wastewater treatment, the most 
commonly used treatment process measures (surrogates) are total coliforms, 
faecal coliforms, Escherichia coli (E. coli), and enterococci. However, 
greywater potentially contains skin pathogens unrelated to faecal load, and E. 
coli and other FIB may grow within greywater unrelated to pathogens. Overall, 
FIB occurs at fluctuating and relatively low concentrations compared to other 
endogenous greywater bacteria affecting their ability as surrogates for pathogen 
reduction. Therefore, unlike municipal sewage, FIB provides a very limited and 
unreliable log-reduction surrogate measure for on-site greywater treatment 
systems. Based on our recent metagenomic study of laundry greywater, 
skin-associated bacteria such as Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, and 
Propionibacterium spp. dominate and may result in more consistent treatment 
surrogates than traditional FIB. Here, we investigated various Staphylococcus 
spp. as potential surrogates to reliably assay over 4-log10 reduction by the 
final-stage UV disinfection step commonly used for on-site greywater reuse, and 
compare them to various FIB/phage surrogates. A collimated UV beam was used to 
determine the efficacy of UV inactivation (255, 265 and 285 nm) against E. coli, 
Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, E. casseliflavus, Staphylococcus aureus, and 
S. epidermidis. Staphylococcus spp. was estimated by combining the bi-linear 
dose-response curves for S. aureus and S. epidermidis and was shown to be less 
resistant to UV irradiation than the other surrogates examined. Hence, a 
relative inactivation credit is suggested; whereas, the doses required to 
achieve a 4 and 5-log10 reduction of Staphylococcus spp. (13.0 and 20.9 mJ cm-2, 
respectively) were used to determine the relative inactivation of the other 
microorganisms investigated. The doses required to achieve a 4 and 5-log10 
reduction of Staphylococcus spp. resulted in a log10 reduction of 1.4 and 4.1 
for E. coli, 0.8 and 2.8 for E. faecalis, 0.8 and 3.6 for E. casseliflavus and 
0.8 and 1.2 for MS2 coliphage, respectively. Given the concentration difference 
of Staphylococcus spp. and FIB (3 to 5-log10 higher), we propose the use of 
Staphylococcus spp. as a novel endogenous performance surrogate to demonstrate 
greywater treatment performance given its relatively high and consistent 
concentration and therefore ability to demonstrate over 5-log10 reductions.

Structure and Dynamics of the Tetra-A Loop and (A-A)-U Sequence Motif within the 
Coliphage GA Replicase RNA Operator.

(1)Department of BioSciences, Rice University , Houston, Texas 77251-1892, 
United States.

The three-dimensional structure of a RNA hairpin containing the RNA operator 
binding site for bacteriophage GA coat protein is presented. The phage GA 
operator contains the asymmetric (A-A)-U sequence motif and is capped by a 
four-adenine (tetra-A) loop. The uridine of the (A-A)-U motif preferentially 
pairs with the 5'-proximal cross-strand adenine, and the 3'-proximal adenine 
stacks into the helix. The tetra-A loop is well-ordered with adenine residues 
2-4 forming a 3' stack. This loop conformation stands in contrast to the 
structure of the 5'-AUUA loop of the related phage MS2 operator in which 
residues 1 and 2 form a 5' stack. The context dependence of the (A-A)-U sequence 
motif conformation was examined using structures of 76 unique occurrences from 
the Protein Data Bank. The motif almost always has one adenine bulged and the 
other adenine adopting an A-U base pair. In the case in which the (A-A)-U motif 
is flanked by only one Watson-Crick base pair, the adenine adjacent to the 
flanking base pair tends to bulge; 80% of motifs with a 3' flanking pair have a 
3' bulged adenine, and 84% of motifs with a 5' flanking pair have a 5' bulged 
adenine. The frequencies of 3'- and 5'-proximal adenines bulging are 33 and 67%, 
respectively, when the (A-A)-U motif is flanked by base pairs on both sides. 
Although a 3' flanking cytidine correlates (88%) with bulging of the 5'-proximal 
adenine, no strict dependence on flanking nucleotide identity was identified for 
the 5' side.

Typical measurement of macromolecules in a biological sample typically averages 
the result over all the cells or molecules within the sample, and while these 
types of measurements provide very useful information, they completely miss 
heterogeneity among the components within the sample that could be a very 
important aspect of the sample's function. These techniques are also limited in 
their ability to examine intracellular spatial orientation of molecular 
activity, which is often a critical component to the regulation of biological 
processes, particularly in cells with unique spatial relationships, such as 
neurons. This makes a strong case for single-cell and single-molecule analysis 
that allows similar novel insight into complex molecular machinery that would 
not be possible when pooling heterogeneous molecular states. mRNA has proven to 
be quite tractable to molecular analysis in single cells. Almost two decades of 
single-molecule studies of mRNA processing both in situ and in live cells have 
been facilitated by microscopy of mRNA. This has been made possible by 
multiplexing fluorophores in situ hybridization probes or fluorescent 
RNA-tag-binding protein probes. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the 
approaches that have made single-molecule mRNA imaging accessible, as well as to 
give an overview of the state of the art for techniques that are available to 
track mRNA in real time in living cells, highlighting the application to 
neuroscience.

Selection of a Biosafety Level 1 (BSL-1) surrogate to evaluate surface 
disinfection efficacy in Ebola outbreaks: Comparison of four bacteriophages.

Massachusetts, United States of America.

The 2014 West African Ebola virus disease outbreak was the largest to date, and 
conflicting, chlorine-based surface disinfection protocols to interrupt disease 
transmission were recommended. We identified only one study documenting surface 
disinfection efficacy against the Ebola virus, showing a >6.6 log reduction 
after 5-minute exposure to 0.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) based on small-scale 
tests (Cook et al. (2015)). In preparation for future extensive, large-scale 
disinfection efficacy experiments, we replicated the Cook et al. experiment 
using four potential BSL-1 surrogates selected based on similarities to the 
Ebola virus: bacteriophages MS2, M13, Phi6, and PR772. Each bacteriophage was 
exposed to 0.1% and 0.5% NaOCl for 1, 5, and 10 minutes on stainless steel. MS2 
and M13 were only reduced by 3.4 log and 3.5 log after a 10-minute exposure to 
0.5% NaOCl, and would be overly conservative surrogates. Conversely, PR772 was 
too easily inactivated for surrogate use, as it was reduced by >4.8 log after 
only 1-minute exposure to 0.5% NaOCl. Phi6 was slightly more resistant than the 
Ebola virus, with 4.1 log reduction after a 5-minute exposure and not detected 
after a 10-minute exposure to 0.5% NaOCl. We therefore recommend Phi6 as a 
surrogate for evaluating the efficacy of chlorine-based surface disinfectants 
against the Ebola virus.

The multiple-barrier concept is widely employed in international and domestic 
guidelines for wastewater reclamation and reuse for microbiological risk 
management, in which a wastewater reclamation system is designed to achieve 
guideline values of the performance target of microbe reduction. Enteric viruses 
are one of the pathogens for which the target reduction values are stipulated in 
guidelines, but frequent monitoring to validate human virus removal efficacy is 
challenging in a daily operation due to the cumbersome procedures for virus 
quantification in wastewater. Bacteriophages have been the first choice 
surrogate for this task, because of the well-characterized nature of strains and 
the presence of established protocols for quantification. Here, we performed a 
meta-analysis to calculate the average log10 reduction values (LRVs) of somatic 
coliphages, F-specific phages, MS2 coliphage and T4 phage by membrane 
bioreactor, activated sludge, constructed wetlands, pond systems, 
microfiltration and ultrafiltration. The calculated LRVs of bacteriophages were 
then compared with reported human enteric virus LRVs. MS2 coliphage LRVs in MBR 
processes were shown to be lower than those of norovirus GII and enterovirus, 
suggesting it as a possible validation and operational monitoring tool. The 
other bacteriophages provided higher LRVs compared to human viruses. The data 
sets on LRVs of human viruses and bacteriophages are scarce except for MBR and 
conventional activated sludge processes, which highlights the necessity of 
investigating LRVs of human viruses and bacteriophages in multiple treatment 
unit processes.

MS2 presents a well-studied example of a single-stranded RNA virus for which the 
genomic RNA plays a pivotal role in the virus assembly process based on the 
packaging signal-mediated mechanism. Packaging signals (PSs) are multiple 
dispersed RNA sequence/structure motifs varying around a central recognition 
motif that interact in a specific way with the capsid protein in the assembly 
process. Although the discovery and identification of these PSs was based on 
bioinformatics and geometric approaches, in tandem with sophisticated 
experimental protocols, we approach this problem using large-scale ab initio 
computation centered on critical aspects of the consensus protein-RNA 
interactions recognition motif. DFT calculations are carried out on two 
nucleoprotein complexes: wild-type and mutated (PDB IDs: 1ZDH and 5MSF ). The 
calculated partial charge distribution of residues and the strength of hydrogen 
bonding (HB) between them enabled us to locate the exact binding sites with the 
strongest HBs, identified to be LYS43-A-4, ARG49-C-13, TYR85-C-5, and LYS61-C-5, 
due to the change in the sequence of the mutated RNA.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate healthcare worker (HCW) risk of self-contamination when 
donning and doffing personal protective equipment (PPE) using fluorescence and 
MS2 bacteriophage. DESIGN Prospective pilot study. SETTING Tertiary-care 
hospital. PARTICIPANTS A total of 36 HCWs were included in this study: 18 
donned/doffed contact precaution (CP) PPE and 18 donned/doffed Ebola virus 
disease (EVD) PPE. INTERVENTIONS HCWs donned PPE according to standard 
protocols. Fluorescent liquid and MS2 bacteriophage were applied to HCWs. HCWs 
then doffed their PPE. After doffing, HCWs were scanned for fluorescence and 
swabbed for MS2. MS2 detection was performed using reverse transcriptase PCR. 
The donning and doffing processes were videotaped, and protocol deviations were 
recorded. RESULTS Overall, 27% of EVD PPE HCWs and 50% of CP PPE HCWs made ≥1 
protocol deviation while donning, and 100% of EVD PPE HCWs and 67% of CP PPE 
HCWs made ≥1 protocol deviation while doffing (P=.02). The median number of 
doffing protocol deviations among EVD PPE HCWs was 4, versus 1 among CP PPE 
HCWs. Also, 15 EVD PPE protocol deviations were committed by doffing assistants 
and/or trained observers. Fluorescence was detected on 8 EVD PPE HCWs (44%) and 
5 CP PPE HCWs (28%), most commonly on hands. MS2 was recovered from 2 EVD PPE 
HCWs (11%) and 3 CP PPE HCWs (17%). CONCLUSIONS Protocol deviations were common 
during both EVD and CP PPE doffing, and some deviations during EVD PPE doffing 
were committed by the HCW doffing assistant and/or the trained observer. 
Self-contamination was common. PPE donning/doffing are complex and deserve 
additional study. Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2017;38:1077-1083.

One key assumption impacting data quality in viral inactivation studies is that 
reduction estimates are not altered by the virus seeding process. However, 
seeding viruses often involves the inadvertent addition of co-constituents such 
as cell culture components or additives used during preparation steps which can 
impact viral reduction estimates by inducing non-representative oxidant demand 
in disinfection studies and fouling in membrane assessments. The objective of 
this study was therefore to characterize a mammalian norovirus surrogate, murine 
norovirus (MNV), and bacteriophage MS2 at sequential stages of viral 
purification and to quantify their potential contribution to artificial oxidant 
demand and non-representative membrane fouling. Our results demonstrate that 
seeding solvent extracted and 0.1 micron filtered MNV to ~105 PFU/mL in an 
experimental water matrix will result in additional total organic carbon (TOC) 
and 30 min chlorine demand of 39.2 mg/L and 53.5 mg/L as Cl2, respectively. 
Performing sucrose cushion purification on the MNV stock prior to seeding 
reduces the impacts of TOC and chlorine demand to 1.6 and 0.15 mg/L as Cl2, 
respectively. The findings for MNV are likely relevant for other mammalian 
viruses propagated in serum-based media. Thus, advanced purification of 
mammalian virus stocks by sucrose cushion purification (or equivalent 
density-based separation approach) is warranted prior to seeding in water 
treatment assessments. Studies employing bacteriophage MS2 as a surrogate virus 
may not need virus purification, since seeding MS2 at a concentration of ~106 
PFU/mL will introduce only ~1 mg/L of TOC and ~1 mg/L as Cl2 of chlorine demand 
to experimental water matrices.

Contact transmission of pathogens from personal protective equipment is a 
concern within the healthcare industry. During public health emergency 
outbreaks, resources become constrained and the reuse of personal protective 
equipment, such as N95 filtering facepiece respirators, may be needed. This 
study was designed to characterize the transfer of bacteriophage MS2 and 
fluorescein between filtering facepiece respirators and the wearer's hands 
during three simulated use scenarios. Filtering facepiece respirators were 
contaminated with MS2 and fluorescein in droplets or droplet nuclei. Thirteen 
test subjects performed filtering facepiece respirator use scenarios including 
improper doffing, proper doffing and reuse, and improper doffing and reuse. 
Fluorescein and MS2 contamination transfer were quantified. The average MS2 
transfer from filtering facepiece respirators to the subjects' hands ranged from 
7.6-15.4% and 2.2-2.7% for droplet and droplet nuclei derived contamination, 
respectively. Handling filtering facepiece respirators contaminated with 
droplets resulted in higher levels of MS2 transfer compared to droplet nuclei 
for all use scenarios (p = 0.007). MS2 transfer from droplet contaminated 
filtering facepiece respirators during improper doffing and reuse was greater 
than transfer during improper doffing (p = 0.008) and proper doffing and reuse 
(p = 0.042). Droplet contamination resulted in higher levels of fluorescein 
transfer compared to droplet nuclei contaminated filtering facepiece respirators 
for all use scenarios (p = 0.009). Fluorescein transfer was greater for improper 
doffing and reuse (p = 0.007) from droplet contaminated masks compared to 
droplet nuclei contaminated filtering facepiece respirators and for improper 
doffing and reuse when compared improper doffing (p = 0.017) and proper doffing 
and reuse (p = 0.018) for droplet contaminated filtering facepiece respirators. 
For droplet nuclei contaminated filtering facepiece respirators, the difference 
in MS2 and fluorescein transfer did not reach statistical significance when 
comparing any of the use scenarios. The findings suggest that the results of 
fluorescein and MS2 transfer were consistent and highly correlated across the 
conditions of study. The data supports CDC recommendations for using proper 
doffing techniques and discarding filtering facepiece respirators that are 
directly contaminated with secretions from a cough or sneeze.

Surfactant Modified Zeolite (SMZ) represents a versatile, cost-effective 
permeable reactive material, capable of treating multiple classes of 
contaminants. The potential for HDTMA-Br, a cationic surfactant commonly used to 
modify zeolite, to desorb from the zeolite surface has been identified as a 
potential issue for the ongoing use of SMZ in water remediation contexts. This 
paper investigates the toxicity of HDTMA-Br towards enteric virus surrogates, 
F-RNA bacteriophage MS2 and E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, and soil microflora. The 
concentration of surfactant desorbing from SMZ was quantified through a bioassay 
using E. coli. Results showed HDTMA-Br concentrations of ≥10-5M were toxic to 
MS2, ≥10-4M were toxic to E. coli and ≥10-6M were toxic to B. subtilis. No toxic 
relationship was established between HDTMA-Br and soil microflora. Desorption of 
≥10-4M of HDTMA-Br was shown for the two SMZ samples under the mixing conditions 
used. Effects of this surfactant on total soil microflora were ambiguous since 
no toxic relationship could be established, however, HDTMA-Br, at concentrations 
desorbing from SMZ, were shown to impact the soil bacterium B. subtilis. Further 
research is required to determine the effect of this surfactant on microbial 
populations and species diversity in soils.

The photo-Fenton process is recognized as a promising technique towards 
microorganism disinfection in wastewater, but its efficiency is hampered at 
near-neutral pH operating values. In this work, we overcome these obstacles by 
using the heterogeneous photo-Fenton process as the default disinfecting 
technique, targeting MS2 coliphage in wastewater. The use of low concentrations 
of iron oxides in wastewater without H2O2 (wüstite, maghemite, magnetite) has 
demonstrated limited semiconductor-mediated MS2 inactivation. Changing the 
operational pH and the size of the oxide particles indicated that the 
isoelectric point of the iron oxides and the active surface area are crucial in 
the success of the process, and the possible underlying mechanisms are 
investigated. Furthermore, the addition of low amounts of Fe-oxides (1mgL-1) and 
H2O2 in the system (1, 5 and 10mgL-1) greatly enhanced the inactivation process, 
leading to heterogeneous photo-Fenton processes on the surface of the 
magnetically separable oxides used. Additionally, photo-dissolution of iron in 
the bulk, lead to homogeneous photo-Fenton, further aided by the complexation by 
the dissolved organic matter in the solution. Finally, we assess the impact of 
the presence of the bacterial host and the difference caused by the different 
iron sources (salts, oxides) and the Fe-oxide size (normal, nano-sized).

Small single-stranded nucleic acid phages effect lysis by expressing a single 
protein, the amurin, lacking muralytic enzymatic activity. Three amurins have 
been shown to act like 'protein antibiotics' by inhibiting cell-wall 
biosynthesis. However, the L lysis protein of the canonical ssRNA phage MS2, a 
75 aa polypeptide, causes lysis by an unknown mechanism without affecting net 
peptidoglycan synthesis. To identify residues important for lytic function, 
randomly mutagenized alleles of L were generated, cloned into an inducible 
plasmid and the transformants were selected on agar containing the inducer. From 
a total of 396 clones, 67 were unique single base-pair changes that rendered L 
non-functional, of which 44 were missense mutants and 23 were nonsense mutants. 
Most of the non-functional missense alleles that accumulated in levels 
comparable to the wild-type allele are localized in the C-terminal half of L, 
clustered in and around an LS dipeptide sequence. The LS motif was used to align 
L genes from ssRNA phages lacking any sequence similarity to MS2 or to each 
other. This alignment revealed a conserved domain structure, in terms of charge, 
hydrophobic character and predicted helical content. None of the missense 
mutants affected membrane-association of L. Several of the L mutations in the 
central domains were highly conservative and recessive, suggesting a defect in a 
heterotypic protein-protein interaction, rather than in direct disruption of the 
bilayer structure, as had been previously proposed for L.

This study investigated the influence of membrane property and feed water 
organic matter quality on the permeate flux and water quality during 
gravity-driven membrane (GDM) filtration. GDM filtration was continuously 
carried out over 500 days at hydrostatic pressure of 65 mbar in dead-end mode 
without any back-flushing or membrane cleaning. Three ultrafiltration (UF) 
membranes (PES-100 kDa, PVDF-120 kDa, and PVDF-100 kDa) and one microfiltration 
(MF) membrane (PTFE-0.3 μm) were tested for treating lake water with varied 
organic matter qualities due to algal growth. The fluxes of the four membranes 
rapidly decreased to ~8 L/(m2 × h) within a week of GDM filtration. The flux 
variations were quite similar for the four membranes during the entire GDM 
filtration, indicating that membrane property has a little effect on the flux. 
The flux strongly depends on the feed water organic matter quality. The average 
flux in treating low organics containing water (7-60 days) was ~5 L/(m2 × h) and 
decreased to ~2 L/(m2 × h) in treating high organics containing water 
(60-300 days). The accumulation of algal-derived biopolymers was mainly 
responsible for the flux decline by forming biofilms with high permeation 
resistance. The average flux in 300-500 days increased to ~3.5 L/(m2 × h) when 
the feed water contained lower levels of biopolymers and higher levels of easily 
biodegradable organics, which created open and heterogeneous biofilms with lower 
permeation resistance. Removal efficiency for Escherichia coli was more than 5 
log, while the removal efficiency for total bacterial cells was 1 log-2 log for 
the four membranes, indicating some bacterial regrowth after the filtration. 
Removal efficiency for the MS2 phage was 2.4 log and 1.5 log for the fouled 
PES-UF and PTFE-MF membranes.

Households that lack piped water supply are often forced to meet water needs by 
storing in the home, leaving water vulnerable to contamination by viruses. 
Storage in copper containers can potentially prevent this type of contamination, 
but the inactivation kinetics of viruses by copper need to be described to make 
appropriate storage recommendations. This work characterized inactivation 
kinetics of bacteriophage MS2 as a surrogate for enteric viruses by dissolved 
ionic copper in water. Reduction of MS2 increased with increasing doses of 
copper. At 0.3 mg/L, there was a 1.8-log10 reduction of MS2 within 6 h. At 1 and 
3 mg/L, 2-2.5 log10 inactivation could be achieved between 6 and 24 h. 
Parameters for the Chick-Watson, Hom, and One Hit-Two Population models of 
inactivation were calculated and evaluated, all of which demonstrated strong 
goodness-of-fit and predictability at various contact times. Copper inactivates 
MS2 under controlled conditions at doses between 0.3 and 3 mg/L. Although 
requiring longer contact times than conventional disinfectants, it is a 
candidate for improving the safety of stored drinking water.

Ceramic pot filters are considered safe, robust and appropriate technologies, 
but there is a general consensus that water revenues are limited due to clogging 
of the ceramic element. The objective of this study was to investigate the 
potential of high flow ceramic pot filters to produce more water without 
sacrificing their microbial removal efficacy. High flow pot filters, produced by 
increasing the rice husk content, had a higher initial flow rate (6-19 L h-1), 
but initial LRVs for E. coli of high flow filters was slightly lower than for 
regular ceramic pot filters. This disadvantage was, however, only temporarily as 
the clogging in high flow filters had a positive effect on the LRV for E. coli 
(from below 1 to 2-3 after clogging). Therefore, it can be carefully concluded 
that regular ceramic pot filters perform better initially, but after clogging, 
the high flow filters have a higher flow rate as well as a higher LRV for E. 
coli. To improve the initial performance of new high flow filters, it is 
recommended to further utilize residence time of the water in the receptacle, 
since additional E. coli inactivation was observed during overnight storage. 
Although a relationship was observed between flow rate and LRV of MS2 
bacteriophages, both regular and high flow filters were unable to reach over 2 
LRV.

The aim of this study was to accurately quantify the impact of hydrodynamic 
cavitation on the infectivity of bacteriophage MS2, a norovirus surrogate, and 
to develop a small scale reactor for testing the effect of hydrodynamic 
cavitation on human enteric viruses, which cannot be easily prepared in large 
quantities. For this purpose, 3 mL scale and 1 L scale reactors were constructed 
and tested. Both devices were efficient in generating hydrodynamic cavitation 
and in reducing the infectivity of MS2 virus. Furthermore, they reached more 
than 4 logs reductions of viral infectivity, thus confirming the scalability of 
hydrodynamic cavitation for this particular application. As for the mechanism of 
page inactivation, we suspect that cavitation generated OH- radicals formed an 
advanced oxidation process, which could have damaged the host's recognition 
receptors located on the surface of the bacteriophage. Additional damage could 
arise from the high shear forces inside the cavity. Moreover, the effectiveness 
of the cavitation was higher for suspensions containing low initial viral titers 
that are in similar concentration to the ones found in real water samples. 
According to this, cavitation generators could prove to be a useful tool for 
treating virus-contaminated wastewaters in the future.

The majority of the good DNA editing techniques have been developed in 
Escherichia coli; however, Bacillus subtilis is better host for a plethora of 
synthetic biology and biotechnology applications. Reliable and efficient systems 
for the transfer of synthetic DNA between E. coli and B. subtilis are therefore 
of the highest importance. Using synthetic biology approaches, such as 
streamlined lambda Red recombineering and Gibson Isothermal Assembly, we 
integrated genetic circuits pT7L123, Repr-ts-1 and pLT7pol encoding the lysis 
genes of bacteriophages MS2, ΦX174 and lambda, the thermosensitive repressor and 
the T7 RNA polymerase into the E. coli chromosome. In this system, T7 RNA 
polymerase regulated by the thermosensitive repressor drives the expression of 
the phage lysis genes. We showed that T7 RNA polymerase significantly increases 
efficiency of cell lysis and transfer of the plasmid and bacterial artificial 
chromosome-encoded DNA from the lysed E. coli into B. subtilis. The T7 RNA 
polymerase-driven inducible cell lysis system is suitable for the efficient cell 
lysis and transfer of the DNA engineered in E. coli to other naturally competent 
hosts, such as B. subtilis.

Male-specific bacteriophages have been proposed as human enteric virus 
indicators for shellfish. In this study, Eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) 
were individually exposed to 5.6 × 1010 PFU of MS-2 for 48 h at 15 °C followed 
by collective maintenance in continuously UV-sterilized seawater for 0-6 weeks 
at either 7, 15, or 24 °C. Initial contamination levels of MS-2 were >6 log PFU. 
Assessment of weekly declines of viable MS-2 indicated that cooler temperatures 
dramatically enhanced the persistence of MS-2 within oyster tissues. At 3 weeks, 
the average log PFU reductions for MS-2 within oysters were 2.28, 2.90, and 4.57 
for oysters held at 7, 15, and 24 °C, respectively. Fitting temporal survival 
data with linear and nonlinear Weibull models indicated that the Weibull model 
best fit the observed reductions. In total, these data can serve as a guideline 
for regulatory agencies regarding the influence of water temperature on 
indicator phage after episodic sewage exposure.

The well-characterized interaction between the MS2 coat protein and its cognate 
RNA hairpin was used to evaluate changes in affinity as a result of 
phosphorodithioate (PS2) replacing phosphate by biolayer interferometry (BLI). A 
structure-based analysis of the data provides insights into the origins of the 
enhanced affinity of RNA-protein interactions triggered by the PS2 moiety.

A new generation of cell-free transcription-translation (TXTL) systems, 
engineered to have a greater versatility and modularity, provide novel 
capabilities to perform basic and applied sciences in test tube reactions. Over 
the past decade, cell-free TXTL has become a powerful technique for a broad 
range of novel multidisciplinary research areas related to quantitative and 
synthetic biology. The new TXTL platforms are particularly useful to construct 
and interrogate biochemical systems through the execution of synthetic or 
natural gene circuits. In vitro TXTL has proven convenient to rapidly prototype 
regulatory elements and biological networks as well as to recapitulate molecular 
self-assembly mechanisms found in living systems. In this article, we describe 
how infectious bacteriophages, such as MS2 (RNA), ΦΧ174 (ssDNA), and T7 (dsDNA), 
are entirely synthesized from their genome in one-pot reactions using an all 
Escherichia coli, cell-free TXTL system. Synthesis of the three coliphages is 
quantified using the plaque assay. We show how the yield of synthesized phage 
depends on the biochemical settings of the reactions. Molecular crowding, 
emulated through a controlled concentration of PEG 8000, affects the amount of 
synthesized phages by orders of magnitudes. We also describe how to amplify the 
phages and how to purify their genomes. The set of protocols and results 
presented in this work should be of interest to multidisciplinary researchers 
involved in cell-free synthetic biology and bioengineering.

An increasing number of publications describe the potential of ionic liquids 
(ILs) as novel antimicrobials, antibacterial coatings and even as active 
pharmaceutical ingredients. Nevertheless, a major research area, notably their 
impact on viruses, has so far been neglected. Consequently the aim of this study 
was to examine the effects of ILs on the infectivity of viruses. A systematic 
analysis to investigate the effects of defined structural elements of ILs on 
virus activity was performed using 55 ILs. All structure activity relationships 
(SARs) were tested on the human norovirus surrogate phage MS2 and phage P100 
representing non-enveloped DNA viruses. Results demonstrate that IL SAR 
conclusions, established for prokaryotes and eukaryotes, are not readily 
applicable to the examined phages. A virus-type-dependent IL influence was also 
apparent. Overall, four ILs, covering different structural elements, were found 
to reduce phage P100 infectivity by ≥4 log10 units, indicating a virucidal 
effect, whereas the highest reduction for phage MS2 was about 3 log10 units. 
Results indicate that future applications of ILs as virucidal agents will 
require development of novel SARs and the obtained results serve as a good 
starting point for future studies.

Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) cause approximately 5% of cancer cases worldwide. 
Fortunately, three prophylactic vaccines have been approved to protect against 
HPV infections. Gardasil-9, the most recent HPV vaccine, is predicted to offer 
protection against the HPV types that cause ∼90% of cervical cancer, 86% of 
HPV-associated penile cancers, and ∼93% of HPV-associated head & neck cancers. 
As an alternative to Gardasil-9, we developed and tested a novel candidate 
vaccine targeting conserved epitopes in the HPV minor capsid protein, L2. We 
displayed a tandem HPV31/16L2 peptide (amino acid 17-31) or consensus peptides 
from HPV L2 (amino acid 69-86 or 108-122) on the surface of bacteriophage MS2 
virus-like particles (VLPs). Mice immunized with the MS2 VLPs displaying the 
tandem peptide or immunized with a mixture of VLPs (displaying the tandem 
peptide and consensus peptide 69-86) elicited high titer antibodies against 
individual L2 epitopes. Moreover, vaccinated mice were protected from 
cervicovaginal infection with HPV pseudoviruses 16, 31, 45, 58 and sera from 
immunized mice neutralized HPV pseudoviruses 18 and 33 at levels similar to mice 
immunized with Gardasil-9. These results suggest that immunization with a 
tandem, L2 peptide or a low valency mixture of L2 peptide-displaying VLPs can 
provide broad protection against multiple HPV types.

This study examined the inactivation of human norovirus (HuNoV) GI.1 and GII.4 
by chlorine under conditions mimicking sewage treatment. Using a porcine gastric 
mucin-magnetic bead (PGM-MB) assay, no statistically significant loss in HuNoV 
binding (inactivation) was observed for secondary effluent treatments of ≤25 ppm 
total chlorine; for both strains, 50 and 100 ppm treatments resulted in 
≤0.8-log10 unit and ≥3.9-log10 unit reductions, respectively. Treatments of 10, 
25, 50, and 100 ppm chlorine inactivated 0.31, 1.35, >5, and >5 log10 units, 
respectively, of the norovirus indicator MS2 bacteriophage. Evaluation of 
treatment time indicated that the vast majority of MS2 and HuNoV inactivation 
occurred in the first 5 min for 0.2-μm-filtered, prechlorinated secondary 
effluent. Free chlorine measurements of secondary effluent seeded with MS2 and 
HuNoV demonstrated substantial oxidative burdens. With 25, 50, and 100 ppm 
treatments, free chlorine levels after 5 min of exposure ranged from 0.21 to 
0.58 ppm, from 0.28 to 16.7 ppm, and from 11.6 to 53 ppm, respectively. At 
chlorine treatment levels of >50 ppm, statistically significant differences were 
observed between reductions for PGM-MB-bound HuNoV (potentially infectious) 
particles and those for unbound (noninfectious) HuNoV particles or total 
norovirus particles. While results suggested that MS2 and HuNoV (measured as 
PGM-MB binding) behave similarly, although not identically, both have limited 
susceptibility to chlorine treatments of ≤25 ppm total chlorine. Since sewage 
treatment is performed at ≤25 ppm total chlorine, targeting free chlorine levels 
of 0.5 to 1.0 ppm, these results suggest that traditional chlorine-based sewage 
treatment does not inactivate HuNoV efficiently.IMPORTANCE HuNoV is ubiquitous 
in sewage. A receptor binding assay was used to assess inactivation of HuNoV by 
chlorine-based sewage treatment, given that the virus cannot be routinely 
propagated in vitro Results reported here indicate that chlorine treatment of 
sewage is not effective for inactivating HuNoV unless chlorine levels are above 
those routinely used for sewage treatment.

Micro-scale technology was used to obtain survival data for three animal viruses 
and two bacteriophages during anaerobic digestion. The data for adenoviruses, 
MS2 and Φ6 provide the first published reports for survival of these viruses 
during mesophilic anaerobic digestion. Data were also obtained for thermophilic 
digestion, which showed greater inactivation of viruses at the higher 
temperature. Data on the survival of Φ6 are of particular interest since it is a 
lipid-based virus which has been suggested as a surrogate for the Ebola virus. 
In contrast, MS2 was found to be an inappropriate surrogate for Ebola.

Enteric viruses are recognized as major etiologies of U.S. foodborne infections. 
These viruses are easily transmitted via food contact surfaces. Understanding 
virus interactions with surfaces may facilitate the development of improved 
means for their removal, thus reducing transmission. Using MS2 coliphage as a 
virus surrogate, the strength of virus adhesion to common food processing and 
preparation surfaces of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and glass was assessed by 
atomic force microscopy (AFM) and virus recovery assays. The interaction forces 
of MS2 with various surfaces were measured from adhesion peaks in force-distance 
curves registered using a spherical bead probe preconjugated with MS2 particles. 
MS2 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) demonstrated approximately 5 times less 
adhesion force to glass (0.54 nN) than to PVC (2.87 nN) (P < 0.0001). This was 
consistent with the virus recovery data, which showed 1.4-fold fewer virus PFU 
recovered from PVC than from glass after identical inoculations and 24 h of cold 
storage. The difference in adhesion was ascribed to both intrinsic chemical 
characteristics and the substrate surface porosity (smooth glass versus porous 
PVC). Incorporating a surfactant micellar solution of sodium dodecyl sulfate 
(SDS) into the PBS reduced the adhesion force for PVC (∼0 nN) and consistently 
increased virus recovery by 19%. With direct and indirect evidence of virus 
adhesion, this study illustrated a two-way assessment of virus adhesion for the 
initial evaluation of potential means to mitigate virus adhesion to food contact 
surfaces.IMPORTANCE The spread of foodborne viruses is likely associated with 
their adhesive nature. Virus attachment on food contact surfaces has been 
evaluated by quantitating virus recoveries from inoculated surfaces. This study 
aimed to evaluate the microenvironment in which nanometer-sized viruses interact 
with food contact surfaces and to compare the virus adhesion differences using 
AFM. The virus surrogate MS2 demonstrated less adhesion force to glass than to 
PVC via AFM, with the force-contributing factors including the intrinsic nature 
and the topography of the contact surfaces. This adhesion finding is consistent 
with the virus recoveries, which were determined indirectly. Greater numbers of 
viruses were recovered from glass than from PVC, after application at the same 
levels. The stronger MS2 adhesion onto PVC could be interrupted by incorporating 
a surfactant during the interaction between the virus and the contact surface. 
This study increases our understanding of the virus adhesion microenvironment 
and indicates ways to mitigate virus adhesion onto contact surfaces.

The present work evaluates the effect of contact filtration, preceded by 
coagulation with zirconium (Zr) and chitosan coagulants, on model microorganisms 
and waterborne pathogens. River water intended for potable water production was 
spiked with MS2 and Salmonella Typhimurium 28B bacteriophages, Escherichia coli, 
and Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts prior to coagulation. The hygienic 
performance demonstrated by Zr comprised 3.0-4.0 log10 removal of viruses and 
5.0-6.0 log10 removal of E. coli and C. parvum oocysts. Treatment with chitosan 
resulted in a removal of 2.5-3.0 log10 of viruses and parasites, and 4.5-5.0 
log10 of bacteria. A reference coagulant, polyaluminium chloride (PACl), gave a 
2.5-3.0 log10 removal of viruses and 4.5 log10 of E. coli. These results 
indicate that both Zr and chitosan enable adequate removal of microorganisms 
from surface water. The present study also attempts to assess removal rates of 
the selected microorganisms with regard to their size and surface properties. 
The isoelectric point of the Salmonella Typhimurium 28B bacteriophage is 
reported for the first time. The retention of the selected microorganisms in the 
filter bed appeared to have some correlation with their size, but the effect of 
the charge remained unclear.

SDS is commonly employed as BGE additive in CZE analysis of non-enveloped 
icosahedral viruses. But the way by which SDS interacts with the surface of such 
viruses remains to date poorly known, making complicate to understand their 
behavior during a run. In this article, two related bacteriophages, MS2 and Qβ, 
are used as model to investigate the migration mechanism of non-enveloped 
icosahedral viruses in SDS-based CZE. Both phages are characterized by similar 
size and surface charge but significantly different surface hydrophobicity 
(Qβ > MS2, where '>' means 'more hydrophobic than'). By comparing their 
electrophoretic mobility in the presence or not of SDS on both sides of the CMC, 
we show that surface hydrophobicity of phages is a key factor influencing their 
mobility and that SDS-virus association is driven by hydrophobic interactions at 
the surface of virions. The CZE analyses of heated MS2 particles, which 
over-express hydrophobic domains at their surface, confirm this finding. The 
correlations between the present results and others from the literature suggest 
that the proposed mechanism might not be exclusive to the bacteriophages 
examined here.

Evidence has shown that environmental surfaces play an important role in the 
transmission of nosocomial pathogens. Deploying antimicrobial surfaces in 
hospital wards could reduce the role environmental surfaces play as reservoirs 
for pathogens. Herein we show a significant reduction in viable counts of 
Staphylococcus epidermidis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and MS2 Bacteriophage 
after light treatment of a medical grade silicone incorporating crystal violet, 
methylene blue and 2 nm gold nanoparticles. Furthermore, a migration assay 
demonstrated that in the presence of light, growth of the fungus-like organism 
Pythium ultimum and the filamentous fungus Botrytis cinerea was inhibited. 
Atomic Force Microscopy showed significant alterations to the surface of S. 
epidermidis, and electron microscopy showed cellular aggregates connected by 
discrete surface linkages. We have therefore demonstrated that the embedded 
surface has a broad antimicrobial activity under white light and that the 
surface treatment causes bacterial envelope damage and cell aggregation.

Although many studies concerning the detection of influenza virus have been 
published, a paper-based, label-free electrochemical immunosensor has never been 
reported. Here, we present a cost-effective, handmade paper-based immunosensor 
for label-free electrochemical detection of influenza virus H1N1. This 
immunosensor was prepared by modifying paper with a spray of hydrophobic silica 
nanoparticles, and using stencil-printed electrodes. We used a glass vaporizer 
to spray the hydrophobic silica nanoparticles onto the paper, rendering it 
super-hydrophobic. The super-hydrophobicity, which is essential for this 
paper-based biosensor, was achieved via 30-40 spray coatings, corresponding to a 
0.39-0.41 mg cm-2 coating of nanoparticles on the paper and yielding a water 
contact angle of 150° ± 1°. Stencil-printed carbon electrodes modified with 
single-walled carbon nanotubes and chitosan were employed to increase the 
sensitivity of the sensor, and the antibodies were immobilized via 
glutaraldehyde cross-linking. Differential pulse voltammetry was used to assess 
the sensitivity of the sensors at various virus concentrations, ranging from 10 
to 10⁴ PFU mL-1, and the selectivity was assessed against MS2 bacteriophages and 
the influenza B viruses. These immunosensors showed good linear behaviors, 
improved detection times (30 min), and selectivity for the H1N1 virus with a 
limit of detection of 113 PFU mL-1, which is sufficiently sensitive for rapid 
on-site diagnosis. The simple and inexpensive methodologies developed in this 
study have great potential to be used for the development of a low-cost and 
disposable immunosensor for detection of pathogenic microorganisms, especially 
in developing countries.

Understanding virus transfer between liquid and skin is necessary to estimate 
transmission during water-related activities. Here, we modeled virus transfer 
from liquid-to-skin and skin-to-liquid. We performed human subject studies using 
three bacteriophages as pathogenic virus surrogates: nonenveloped MS2 and Qβ and 
enveloped Φ6. Our study shows that transfer from liquid-to-skin is describable 
by a single model based on (1) virus concentration and (2) volume of liquid 
remaining on skin. Contact times (0.1-30 min), and virus species had 
little-to-no influence on virus transfer. Likewise, liquid conditions (pH 6-9, 
ionic strength 10-550 mM) had no influence on transfer as shown for MS2. The 
model accounts for both, virus adsorbed onto the skin, and virus in the liquid 
retained on skin. In comparison, virus transfer from skin-to-liquid was 
influenced by the wetness of the skin and by liquid type (water, saliva). 90 ± 
19% of the virus inoculated on the skin are transferred to the water when the 
skin remains wet compared to 30 ± 17% when the skin is dry. The transfer from 
skin-to-liquid was 41% higher when the recipient liquid was water as compared 
with saliva. This study quantifies virus transfer between liquid and skin and 
guides risk assessments of water-related activities.

Viral aerosol infection through cough generates large amounts of viral aerosol 
and can result in many adverse health effects such as influenza flu and severe 
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). To characterize the coughed viral aerosol, 
the sampler needs to sample at higher flow rate and possess high physical 
collection efficiency as well as high viral preservation. However, most current 
inertia-based high flow bioaerosol samplers are not suited for viral aerosol 
sampling since the viability will be lost doing the sampling process. Current 
condensation growth methods only have good physical collection efficiency and 
viral preservation at low flow rate (< 10 LPM). In this study, we developed a 
viral aerosol sampling system using a cooler and steam-jet aerosol collector 
(SJAC) for bioaerosol collection for the first time. The system is based on 
mixing condensation growth method and has high viral preservation at a higher 
flow rate (12.5 LPM). We control the inlet aerosol flow temperature and the SJAC 
mixing reservoir temperature to improve the physical collection efficiency and 
viability preservation of the viral aerosol. Results indicate that the physical 
collection efficiency is 70-99% for aerosol 30-100 nm when the aerosol flow and 
mixing reservoir temperature was 19 and 50 °C, respectively. In addition, the 
system was 7 and 22 times more efficient for viability preservation of MS2 
bacteriophage than the commonly used All Glass Impinger 30 (AGI-30) and 
BioSampler®, respectively. Finally, the system can be applied to sample at a 
lower concentration (105 PFU/m3), and results shows the system was 4.7 times 
more efficient for viability preservation than using AGI-30 alone. The developed 
viral collection system will improve our understanding of the characteristics of 
coughed aerosol and can be used for future evaluation of respiratory protective 
equipment and environmental sampling.

Here, we evaluated the removal of three representative human enteric viruses - 
adenovirus (AdV) type 40, coxsackievirus (CV) B5, and hepatitis A virus (HAV) IB 
- and one surrogate of human caliciviruses - murine norovirus (MNV) type 1 - by 
coagulation-rapid sand filtration, using water samples from eight water sources 
for drinking water treatment plants in Japan. The removal ratios of a plant 
virus (pepper mild mottle virus; PMMoV) and two bacteriophages (MS2 and φX174) 
were compared with the removal ratios of human enteric viruses to assess the 
suitability of PMMoV, MS2, and φX174 as surrogates for human enteric viruses. 
The removal ratios of AdV, CV, HAV, and MNV, evaluated via the real-time 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, were 0.8-2.5-log10 when commercially 
available polyaluminum chloride (PACl, basicity 1.5) and virgin silica sand were 
used as the coagulant and filter medium, respectively. The type of coagulant 
affected the virus removal efficiency, but the age of silica sand used in the 
rapid sand filtration did not. Coagulation-rapid sand filtration with 
non-sulfated, high-basicity PACls (basicity 2.1 or 2.5) removed viruses more 
efficiently than the other aluminum-based coagulants. The removal ratios of MS2 
were sometimes higher than those of the three human enteric viruses and MNV, 
whereas the removal ratios of φX174 tended to be smaller than those of the three 
human enteric viruses and MNV. In contrast, the removal ratios of PMMoV were 
similar to and strongly correlated with those of the three human enteric viruses 
and MNV. Thus, PMMoV appears to be a suitable surrogate for human enteric 
viruses for the assessment of the efficacy of coagulation-rapid sand filtration 
to remove viruses.

The inactivation efficacy of bacteriophage MS2 by simulated sunlight irradiation 
was investigated to understand the effects of MS2 aggregation and adsorption to 
particles in solutions with different components. Kaolinite and Microcystis 
aeruginosa were used as model inorganic and organic particles, respectively. 
Lower pH and di-valent ions (Ca2+) were main factors on the aggregation and 
inactivation of MS2. In the presence of both particles, there was no significant 
impact on the MS2 inactivation efficacy by kaolinite (10-200mM) or Microcystis 
aeruginosa (102-105Cells/mL) in 1mM NaCl at pH 7. However at lower pH 3, MS2 
aggregates formed in the particle-free and kaolinite-containing solutions, 
caused lower inactivation since the outer viruses of aggregation protect the 
inner viruses. In addition, more MS2 adsorbed on Microcystis aeruginosa at lower 
pH (3 and 4). Microcystis aeruginosa would act as a potential photosensitizer 
for ROS production to inactivate the adsorbed MS2, since extracellular organic 
matter (EOM) of Microcystis aeruginosa was detected in this study, which has 
been reported to produce ROS under solar irradiation. At pH 7, Na+ had no effect 
on the inactivation of MS2, because MS2 was stable and dispersed even at 200mM 
Na+. MS2 aggregated and adsorbed on particles even at 10mM Ca2+ and led to lower 
inactivation. Kaolinite cannot offer enough protection to adsorbed MS2 as 
aggregation and Microcystis aeruginosa acts as potential photosensitizer to 
produce ROS and inactivate the adsorbed MS2 at high concentration of Ca2+. In 
particle-free solution, SRNOM inhibited MS2 inactivation by shielding the 
sunlight and coating MS2 to increase its survival.

Photodynamic inactivation of bacteriophage MS2: The A-protein is the target of 
virus inactivation.

Singlet oxygen mediated oxidation has been shown to be responsible for 
photodynamic inactivation (PDI) of viruses in solution with photosensitisers 
such as 5, 10, 15, 20-tetrakis (1-methyl-4-pyridinio) porphyrin tetra 
p-toluenesulfonate (TMPyP). The capsids of non-enveloped viruses, such as 
bacteriophage MS2, are possible targets for viral inactivation by singlet oxygen 
oxidation. Within the capsid (predominantly composed of coat protein), the 
A-protein acts as the host recognition and attachment protein. The A-protein has 
two domains; an α-helix domain and a β-sheet domain. The α-helix domain is 
attached to the viral RNA genome inside the capsid while the β-sheet domain, 
which is on the surface of the capsid, is believed to be the site for attachment 
to the host bacteria pilus during infection. In this study, 4 sequence-specific 
antibodies were raised against 4 sites on the A-protein. Changes induced by the 
oxidation of singlet oxygen were compared to the rate of PDI of the virus. Using 
these antibodies, our results suggest that the rate of PDI is relative to loss 
of antigenicity of two sites on the A-protein. Our data further showed that PDI 
caused aggregation of MS2 particles and crosslinking of MS2 coat protein. 
However, these inter- and intra-capsid changes did not correlate to the rate of 
PDI we observed in MS2. Possible modes of action are discussed as a means to 
gaining insight to the targets and mechanisms of PDI of viruses.

MS2 phage-like particles (MS2 PLP) are artificially constructed pseudo-viral 
particles derived from bacteriophage MS2. They are able to carry a specific 
single stranded RNA (ssRNA) sequence of choice inside their capsid, thus 
protecting it against the effects of ubiquitous nucleases. Such particles are 
able to mimic ssRNA viruses and, thus, may serve as the process control for 
molecular detection and quantification of such agents in several kinds of 
matrices, vaccines and vaccine candidates, drug delivery systems, and systems 
for the display of immunologically active peptides or nanomachines. Currently, 
there are several different in vivo plasmid-driven packaging systems for 
production of MS2 PLP. In order to combine all the advantages of the available 
systems and to upgrade and simplify the production and purification of MS2 PLP, 
a one-plasmid double-expression His-tag system was designed. The described 
system utilizes a unique fusion insertional mutation enabling purification of 
particles using His-tag affinity. Using this new production system, highly pure 
MS2 PLP can be quickly produced and purified by a fast performance liquid 
chromatography (FPLC) approach. The system can be easily adapted to produce 
other MS2 PLP with different properties.

A simple heat treatment, perhaps the most globally recognized point-of-use water 
sterilization method, is seemingly effective against all major pathogens of 
concern, but bulk water boiling is not energy efficient or sustainable. Herein, 
we present the first application of solar-to-thermal converting nanomaterials 
for the direct inactivation of bacteria and viruses in drinking water through 
the application of Au nanorods, carbon black, and Au nanorod-carbon black 
composite materials as light absorbers. With broad absorption bands spanning the 
visible and near-infrared wavelengths, at sufficient concentrations, these 
nanoparticles induce multiple scattering events, increasing photon absorption 
probability and concentrating the light within a small spatial domain, leading 
to localized, intense heating that inactivates microorganisms in close 
proximity. Moving toward practical device design, we have developed a facile 
silane immobilization approach to fabricate films with densely packed layers of 
photothermal nanomaterials. Our results suggest that upon irraditaion with 
simulated solar light, these films can thermally inactivate bacteria and 
viruses, as demonstrated through the inactivation of surrogate organisms 
Escherichia coli K-12, and bacteriophages MS2 and PR772.

Over the last years, the photo-Fenton process has been established as an 
effective, green alternative to chemical disinfection of waters and wastewaters. 
Microorganisms' inactivation is the latest success story in the application of 
this process at near-neutral pH, albeit without clearly elucidated inactivation 
mechanisms. In this review, the main pathways of the combined photo-Fenton 
process against the most frequent pathogen models (Escherichia coli for bacteria 
and MS2 bacteriophage for viruses) are analyzed. Firstly, the action of solar 
light is described and the specific inactivation mechanisms in bacteria 
(internal photo-Fenton) and viruses (genome damage) are presented. The 
contribution of the external pathways due to the potential presence of organic 
matter in generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and their effects on 
microorganism inactivation are discussed. Afterwards, the effects of the gradual 
addition of Fe and H2O2 are assessed and the differences among bacterial and 
viral inactivation are highlighted. As a final step, the simultaneous addition 
of both reagents induces the photo-Fenton in the bulk, focusing on the 
differences induced by the homogeneous or heterogeneous fraction of the process 
and the variation among the two respective targets. This work exploits the 
accumulated evidence on the mechanisms of bacterial inactivation and the scarce 
ones towards viral targets, aiming to bridge this knowledge gap and make 
possible the further application of the photo-Fenton process in the field of 
water/wastewater treatment.

BACKGROUND: Past studies have shown that infectious aerosols created during 
toilet flushing result in surface contamination of the restroom. The goals of 
this study were to quantify viral contamination of surfaces in restrooms after 
flushing and the impact of disinfectants added to the toilet bowl prior to 
flushing on reducing surface contamination.
METHODS: The degree of contamination of surfaces in the restroom was assessed 
with and without the addition of coliphage MS2 to the toilet bowl before 
flushing. The bowl water and various surfaces in the restroom were subsequently 
tested for the presence of the virus.
RESULTS: The toilet bowl rim, toilet seat top, and toilet seat underside were 
contaminated in all trials without a disinfectant added to the bowl water before 
flushing. All disinfectants significantly reduced concentrations on surfaces 
when the contact time was ≥15 minutes. Hydrogen peroxide resulted in very little 
reduction of virus in the toilet bowl (<1 log10). Peracetic acid and quaternary 
ammonium had the greatest log reductions on virus in the organic matter in the 
toilet.
CONCLUSIONS: Toilet flushing resulted in extensive contamination of surfaces 
within the restroom. Addition of disinfectant to the toilet bowl prior to 
flushing reduced the level of contamination in the bowl and fomites after 
flushing.

Type II toxin/antitoxin (TA) systems contribute to the formation of persister 
cells and biofilm formation for many organisms. Aggregatibacter 
actinomycetemcomitans thrives in the complex oral microbial community subjected 
to continual environmental flux. Little is known regarding the presence and 
function of type II TA systems in this organism or their contribution to 
adaptation and persistence in the biofilm. We identified 11 TA systems that are 
conserved across all seven serotypes of A. actinomycetemcomitans and represent 
the RelBE, MazEF and HipAB families of type II TA systems. The systems 
selectively responded to various environmental conditions that exist in the oral 
cavity. Two putative RelBE-like TA systems, D11S_1194-1195 and D11S_1718-1719 
were induced in response to low pH and deletion of D11S_1718-1719 significantly 
reduced metabolic activity of stationary phase A. actinomycetemcomitans cells 
upon prolonged exposure to acidic conditions. The deletion mutant also exhibited 
reduced biofilm biomass when cultured under acidic conditions. The D11S_1194 and 
D11S_1718 toxin proteins inhibited in vitro translation of dihydrofolate 
reductase (DHFR) and degraded ribosome-associated, but not free, MS2 virus RNA. 
In contrast, the corresponding antitoxins (D11S_1195 and D11S_1719), or 
equimolar mixtures of toxin and antitoxin, had no effect on DHFR production or 
RNA degradation. Together, these results suggest that D11S_1194-1195 and 
D11S_1718-1719 are RelBE-like type II TA systems that are activated under acidic 
conditions and may function to cleave ribosome-associated mRNA to inhibit 
translation in A. actinomycetemcomitans. In vivo, these systems may facilitate 
A. actinomycetemcomitans adaptation and persistence in acidic local environments 
in the dental biofilm.

Compactness of viral genomes: effect of disperse and localized random mutations.

Genomes of single-stranded RNA viruses have evolved to optimize several 
concurrent properties. One of them is the architecture of their genomic folds, 
which must not only feature precise structural elements at specific positions, 
but also allow for overall spatial compactness. The latter was shown to be 
disrupted by random synonymous mutations, a disruption which can consequently 
negatively affect genome encapsidation. In this study, we use three mutation 
schemes with different degrees of locality to mutate the genomes of phage MS2 
and Brome Mosaic virus in order to understand the observed sensitivity of the 
global compactness of their folds. We find that mutating local stretches of 
their genomes' sequence or structure is less disruptive to their compactness 
compared to inducing randomly-distributed mutations. Our findings are indicative 
of a mechanism for the conservation of compactness acting on a global scale of 
the genomes, and have several implications for understanding the interplay 
between local and global architecture of viral RNA genomes.

Ozone is an effective disinfectant against all types of waterborne pathogens. 
However, accurate and quantitative kinetic data regarding virus inactivation by 
ozone are scarce, because of the experimental challenges associated with the 
high reactivity of ozone toward viruses. Here, we established an experimental 
batch system that allows tailoring and quantifying of very low ozone exposures 
and simultaneously measuring virus inactivation. Second-order ozone inactivation 
rate constants (kO3-virus) of five enteric viruses [laboratory and two 
environmental strains of coxsackievirus B5 (CVF, CVEnv1, and CVEnv2), human 
adenovirus (HAdV), and echovirus 11 (EV)] and four bacteriophages (MS2, Qβ, T4, 
and Φ174) were measured in buffered solutions. The kO3-virus values of all 
tested viruses ranged from 4.5 × 105 to 3.3 × 106 M-1 s-1. For MS2, kO3-MS2 
depended only weakly on temperature (2-22 °C; Ea = 22.2 kJ mol-1) and pH 
(6.5-8.5), with an increase in kO3-MS2 with increasing pH. The susceptibility of 
the selected viruses toward ozone decreases in the following order: Qβ > CVEnv2 
> EV ≈ MS2 > Φ174 ≈ T4 > HAdV > CVF ≈ CVEnv1. On the basis of the measured 
kO3-Virus and typical ozone exposures applied in water and wastewater treatment, 
we conclude that ozone is a highly effective disinfectant for virus control.

A continuous-flow UV reactor operating at 254nm wave-length was used to 
investigate inactivation of microorganisms including bacteriophage in coconut 
water, a highly opaque liquid food. UV-C inactivation kinetics of two surrogate 
viruses (MS2, T1UV) and three bacteria (E. coli ATCC 25922, Salmonella 
Typhimurium ATCC 13311, Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19115) in buffer and coconut 
water were investigated (D10 values ranging from 2.82 to 4.54mJ·cm-2). A series 
of known UV-C doses were delivered to the samples. Inactivation levels of all 
organisms were linearly proportional to UV-C dose (r2>0.97). At the highest dose 
of 30mJ·cm-2, the three pathogenic organisms were inactivated by >5 log10 
(p<0.05). Results clearly demonstrated that UV-C irradiation effectively 
inactivated bacteriophage and pathogenic microbes in coconut water. The 
inactivation kinetics of microorganisms were best described by log linear model 
with a low root mean square error (RMSE) and high coefficient of determination 
(r2>0.97). Models for predicting log reduction as a function of UV-C irradiation 
dose were found to be significant (p<0.05) with low RMSE and high r2. The 
irradiated coconut water showed no cytotoxic effects on normal human intestinal 
cells and normal mouse liver cells. Overall, these results indicated that UV-C 
treatment did not generate cytotoxic compounds in the coconut water. This study 
clearly demonstrated that high levels of inactivation of pathogens can be 
achieved in coconut water, and suggested potential method for UV-C treatment of 
other liquid foods.
INDUSTRIAL RELEVANCE: This research paper provides scientific evidence of the 
potential benefits of UV-C irradiation in inactivating bacterial and viral 
surrogates at commercially relevant doses of 0-120mJ·cm-2. The irradiated 
coconut water showed no cytotoxic effects on normal intestinal and healthy mice 
liver cells. UV-C irradiation is an attractive food preservation technology and 
offers opportunities for horticultural and food processing industries to meet 
the growing demand from consumers for healthier and safe food products. This 
study would provide technical support for commercialization of UV-C treatment of 
beverages.

Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that has re-emerged and is 
associated with many debilitating clinical manifestations. Research is currently 
being conducted to develop a prophylactic vaccine against the virus; however, 
there has not been any licensed ZIKV vaccine. Recent studies have identified 
potential B-cell epitopes (amino acids 241-259, 294-315, 317-327, 346-361, 
377-388 and 421-437) on the envelope protein of ZIKV, which could be explored to 
develop peptide vaccines against ZIKV infection. Nevertheless, the 
immunogenicity of these epitopes has never been assessed. Here, we displayed 
these epitopes on highly immunogenic bacteriophage virus-like particles (VLPs; 
MS2, PP7 and Qβ) platforms and assessed their immunogenicity in mice. Mice 
immunized with a mixture of VLPs displaying ZIKV envelope B-cell epitopes 
elicited anti-ZIKV antibodies. Although, immunized mice were not protected 
against a high challenge dose of ZIKV, sera - albeit at low titers - from 
immunized mice neutralized (in vitro) a low dose of ZIKV. Taken together, these 
results show that these epitopes are B-cell epitopes and they are immunogenic 
when displayed on a Qβ VLP platform. Furthermore, the results also show that 
immunization with VLPs displaying a single B-cell epitope minimally reduces ZIKV 
infection whereas immunization with a mixture of VLPs displaying a combination 
of the B-cell epitopes neutralizes ZIKV infection. Thus, immunization with a 
mixture of VLPs displaying multiple ZIKV B-cell epitopes is a good strategy to 
enhance ZIKV neutralization.

Norovirus outbreaks are associated with the consumption of contaminated 
shellfish, and so efficient methods to recover and detect infectious norovirus 
in shellfish are important. The Proteinase K digestion method used to recover 
norovirus from shellfish, as described in the ISO 15216, would be a good 
candidate but its impact on the virus capsid integrity and thus infectivity was 
never examined. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the Proteinase 
K digestion method, and of the heat treatment component of the method alone, on 
norovirus (genogroups I and II) and MS2 bacteriophage capsid integrity. A 
slightly modified version of the ISO method was used. RT-qPCR was used for virus 
detection following digestion of accessible viral RNA using RNases. MS2 phage 
infectivity was measured using a plaque assay. The effect of shellfish digestive 
glands (DG) on recovery was evaluated. In the presence of shellfish DG, a 
reduction in MS2 phage infectivity of about 1 log10 was observed after the 
Proteinase K digestion method and after heat treatment component alone. For 
norovirus GII and MS2 phage, there was no significant loss of genome following 
the Proteinase K digestion method but there was a significant 0.24 log10 loss of 
norovirus GI. In the absence of shellfish DG, the reduction in MS2 phage 
infectivity was about 2 log10, with the addition of RNases resulting in a 
significant loss of genome for all tested viruses following complete Proteinase 
K digestion method and the heat treatment alone. While some protective effect 
from the shellfish DG on viruses was observed, the impact on capsid integrity 
and infectivity suggests that this method, while suitable for norovirus genome 
detection, may not completely preserve virus infectivity.

Unstructured 5'-tails act through ribosome standby to override inhibitory 
structure at ribosome binding sites.

University, Box 596, S-75124 Uppsala, Sweden.

Initiation is the rate-limiting step in translation. It is well-known that 
stable structure at a ribosome binding site (RBS) impedes initiation. The 
ribosome standby model of de Smit and van Duin, based on studies of the MS2 
phage coat cistron, proposed how high translation rates can be reconciled with 
stable, inhibitory structures at an RBS. Here, we revisited the coat protein 
system and assessed the translation efficiency from its sequestered RBS by 
introducing standby mutations. Further experiments with gfp reporter constructs 
assessed the effects of 5'-tails-as standby sites-with respect to length and 
sequence contributions. In particular, combining in vivo and in vitro assays, we 
can show that tails of CA-dinucleotide repeats-and to a lesser extent, 
AU-repeats-dramatically increase translation rates. Tails of increasing length 
reach maximal rate-enhancing effects at 16-18 nucleotides. These standby tails 
are single-stranded and do not exert their effect by structure changes in the 
neighboring RBS stem-loop. In vitro translation and toeprinting assays 
furthermore demonstrate that standby effects are exerted at the level of 
translation initiation. Finally, as expected, destabilizing mutations within the 
coat RBS indicate an interplay with the effects of standby tails.

Two virus propagation methods (in broth and on double agar overlay) and three 
purification procedures (PEG precipitation, centrifugal diafiltration and CsCl 
density gradient centrifugation) were comparatively evaluated using MS2 and P22 
bacteriophages as model viruses. The prepared stocks were characterized in terms 
of electrophoretic mobility as a function of pH, particle size distribution, 
surface tension components and the overall hydrophobicity of the virus, as well 
as the percentage of infectious and total virus recovered. The obtained data 
were used to rank the purification methods according to six criteria of likely 
practical relevance. Regardless of the purification method applied, virus 
propagation in broth media resulted in higher purity virus stocks as the growth 
on double agar overlay introduced difficult-to-remove residual agar. CsCl 
density gradient centrifugation gave the highest quality bacteriophage 
suspensions, recovered infectious P22 at least as efficiently as the other two 
purification methods and selected for intact P22 virions over damaged ones. The 
impurities remaining in the virus suspension after PEG precipitation and 
centrifugal diafiltration broadened the size distribution and interfered with 
electrophoretic mobility measurements. The residual impurities had a major 
impact on the free energy of virus-virus interfacial interaction (the 
quantitative measure of virus hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity) leading to an 
incorrect determination of P22 bacteriophage as hydrophilic. The trends in 
measured physicochemical properties can be rationalized by considering 
impurity-coated virions as permeable soft particles.

The waterborne pathogenic viruses threaten human health. And the 
nanomaterial-membrane coupling system is promising in virus removal. In this 
study, phage MS2 was selected as the model virus to investigate the removal of 
virus with the coupling system. Results revealed that commercial nano TiO2 
(Degussa Aeroxide P25) showed both of excellent adsorption and photocatalysis 
performance for virus removal compared with nano ZnO, nano Fe3O4, carbon 
nanotube, graphene, nano Ni and Nano TiO2 (anatase). In P25 photocatalysis 
process, the removal efficiency of phage MS2 increased with the increase of P25 
concentration (0~1000 mg L-1), virus initial concentration (102~106 PFU mL-1), 
UV irradiation doses (5~120 mJ cm-2) and UV light intensity (0.126~0.742 mW 
cm-2). However, when the P25 concentration increased to over 1000 mg L-1, the 
virus removal efficiency would remain stable with the increase of P25 
concentration. The nanomaterial-membrane coupling system showed excellent 
performance for virus removal, which was mainly attributed to the adsorption and 
photocatalysis of P25, and the intercept of membrane. When the P25 concentration 
was 100 mg L-1, UV irradiation dose was 20 mJ cm-2 and transmembrane pressure 
was 20 kPa, the phage MS2 removal efficiency could be up to 100%.

BACKGROUND: Personal protective equipment (PPE) protects healthcare workers 
(HCWs) caring for patients with Ebola virus disease (EVD), and PPE doffing is a 
critical point for preventing viral self-contamination. We assessed 
contamination of skin, gloves, and scrubs after doffing Ebola-level PPE 
contaminated with surrogate viruses: bacteriophages MS2 and Φ6.
METHODS: In a medical biocontainment unit, HCWs (n = 10) experienced in EVD care 
donned and doffed PPE following unit protocols that incorporate trained observer 
guidance and alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR). A mixture of Φ6 (enveloped), MS2 
(nonenveloped), and fluorescent marker was applied to 4 PPE sites, approximating 
body fluid viral load (Φ6, 105; MS2, 106). They performed a patient care task, 
then doffed. Inner gloves, face, hands, and scrubs were sampled for virus, as 
were environmental sites with visible fluorescent marker.
RESULTS: Among 10 HCWs there was no Φ6 transfer to inner gloves, hands, or face; 
1 participant had Φ6 on scrubs at low levels (1.4 × 102). MS2 transfer (range, 
101-106) was observed to scrubs (n = 2), hands (n = 1), and inner gloves (n = 
7), where it was highest. Most (n = 8) had only 1 positive site. Environmental 
samples with visible fluorescent marker (n = 21) were negative.
CONCLUSIONS: Among experienced HCWs, structured, observed doffing using ABHR 
protected against hand contamination with enveloped virus. Nonenveloped virus 
was infrequent on hands and scrubs but common on inner gloves, suggesting that 
inner gloves, but not necessarily ABHR, protect against hand contamination. 
Optimizing doffing protocols to protect against all types of viruses may require 
reinforcing careful handling of scrubs and good glove/hand hygiene with 
effective agents.

Evaluating the reduction of virus load in water reclamation plants is important 
to ensuring the hygienic safety of the reclaimed water. A virus-spiking test is 
usually used to estimate virus reduction but is not practicable at large-scale 
plants. Thus, we evaluated virus reduction by ultrafiltration (UF) plus 
ultraviolet (UV) irradiation at a large-scale reclamation plant (1000 m3/d) by 
quantifying indigenous F-specific RNA bacteriophages (FRNAPHs). To detect the 
infectious FRNAPH, we used both plaque assay and integrated 
culture-reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction combined with the most 
probable number assay, which can detect infectious FRNAPH genotypes. For 
comparison, we determined reductions of indigenous FRNAPHs and spiked MS2 at a 
small-scale pilot plant (10 m3/d) at the same time. Reductions by UF were not 
significantly different among the bacteriophages at pilot plants. This result 
suggests that indigenous bacteriophages could be used for evaluating virus 
reduction by UF at large-scale plants. Indigenous Genotype I (GI) FRNAPH showed 
the highest UV resistance, followed by GII, GIII, and GIV. The resistance of 
GI-FRNAPH was equivalent to that of spiked MS2. The reduction of the total 
infectious FRNAPHs determined by plaque assay was affected by the predominant 
FRNAPH genotype, presumably because of their different UV resistances. Our 
results reveal that indigenous GI-FRNAPH can be a good alternative indicator to 
spiked MS2 in view of virus reduction during water reclamation. The reclaimed 
water from our large-scale reclamation plant could be used for irrigation 
because the expected reduction (6.3 log10) of indigenous GI-FRNAPH achieved the 
Title 22 (>5 log10).

The inactivation of viruses that retain their infectivity when transmitted 
through the air is challenging. To address this issue, this study used a 
non-contact ultrasound transducer (NCUT) to generate shock waves in the air at 
specific distances, input voltages, and exposure durations, targeting 
bacteriophage virus aerosols captured on to H14 HEPA filters. Initially, a 
frequency of 27.56 kHz (50V) at 25-mm distance was used, which yielded an 
inactivation efficiency of up to 32.69 ± 12.10%. Other frequencies at shorter 
distances were investigated, where 29.10 kHz had the highest inactivation 
efficiency (up to 81.95 ± 9.79% at 8.5-mm distance and 100 V). Longer exposure 
times also influenced virus inactivation, but the results were inconclusive 
because the NCUT overheated with time. Overall, NCUT appears to be a promising 
method for inactivating virus aerosols that may be safer than other forms of 
inactivation, which can cause genetic mutations or produce dangerous 
by-products.

Soil passage of (pretreated) surface water to remove pathogenic microorganisms 
is a highly efficient process under oxic conditions, reducing microorganism 
concentrations about 8 log10 within tens of meters. However, under anoxic 
conditions, it has been shown that removal of microorganisms can be limited very 
much. Setback distances for adequate protection of natural groundwater may, 
therefore, be too short if anoxic conditions apply. Because removal of 
microorganisms under suboxic conditions is unknown, this research investigated 
removal of bacteriophage MS2 and PRD1 by soil passage under suboxic conditions 
at field scale. At the field location (dune area), one injection well and six 
monitoring wells were installed at different depths along three suboxic flow 
lines, where oxygen concentrations ranged from 0.4 to 1.7 mg/l and nitrate 
concentrations ranged from 13 to 16 mg/L. PRD1 and MS2 were injected directly at 
the corresponding depths and their removal in each flow line was determined. The 
highest bacteriophage removal was observed in the top layer, with about 9 log 
removal of MS2, and 7 log removal of PRD1 after 16 meters of aquifer transport. 
Less removal was observed at 12 m below surface, probably due to a higher 
groundwater velocity in this coarser grained layer. MS2 was removed more 
effectively than PRD1 under all conditions. Due to short travel times, 
inactivation of the phages was limited and the reported log removal was mainly 
associated with attachment of phages to the aquifer matrix. This study shows 
that attachment of MS2 and PRD1 is similar for oxic and suboxic sandy aquifers, 
and, therefore, setback distances used for sandy aquifers under oxic and suboxic 
conditions provide a similar level of safety. Sticking efficiency and the 
attachment rate coefficient, as measures for virus attachment, were evaluated as 
a function of the physico-chemical conditions.

Self-assembling proteins are critical to biological systems and industrial 
technologies, but predicting how mutations affect self-assembly remains a 
significant challenge. Here, we report a technique, termed SyMAPS (Systematic 
Mutation and Assembled Particle Selection), that can be used to characterize the 
assembly competency of all single amino acid variants of a self-assembling viral 
structural protein. SyMAPS studies on the MS2 bacteriophage coat protein 
revealed a high-resolution fitness landscape that challenges some conventional 
assumptions of protein engineering. An additional round of selection identified 
a previously unknown variant (CP[T71H]) that is stable at neutral pH but less 
tolerant to acidic conditions than the wild-type coat protein. The capsids 
formed by this variant could be more amenable to disassembly in late endosomes 
or early lysosomes-a feature that is advantageous for delivery applications. In 
addition to providing a mutability blueprint for virus-like particles, SyMAPS 
can be readily applied to other self-assembling proteins.

Fundamental challenges of targeting specific brain regions for treatment using 
pharmacotherapeutic nanoparticle (NP) carriers include circumventing the 
blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and tracking delivery. Angiopep-2 (AP2) has been shown 
to facilitate the transport of large macromolecules and synthetic nanoparticles 
across the BBB. Thus, conjugation of AP2 to an MS2 bacteriophage based NP should 
also permit transport across the BBB. We have fabricated and tested a novel MS2 
capsid-based NP conjugated to the ligand AP2. The reaction efficiency was 
determined to be over 70%, with up to two angiopep-2 conjugated per MS2 capsid 
protein. When linked with a porphyrin ring, manganese (Mn2+) remained stable 
within MS2 and was MRI detectable. Nanoparticles were introduced 
intracerebroventricularly or systemically. Systemic delivery yielded dose 
dependent, non-toxic accumulation of NPs in the midbrain. Design of a 
multifunctional MRI compatible NP platform provides a significant step forward 
for the diagnosis and treatment of intractable brain conditions, such as 
tinnitus.

In this work, solar disinfection (SODIS) was enhanced by moderate addition of Fe 
and sodium peroxydisulfate (PDS), under solar light. A systematic assessment of 
the activating factors was performed, firstly isolated, then in pairs and 
concluded in the combined Fe/heat/solar UV-PDS activation process. Solar light 
was the most effective (single) activator, and its combination with Fe and heat 
(double activation) yielded high level of synergies (up to S = 2.13). The triple 
activation was able to reduce the bacterial load up to 6-log in less than 1 h, 
similarly to the photo-Fenton process done in comparison (SODIS alone: >5 h). 
Fe-oxides were suitable activators of PDS under the same conditions while the 
presence of organic matter enhanced bacterial inactivation by the triple 
activated PDS process. The degradation of a (selected) mixture of 
micropollutants (i.e. drugs, pesticides) was also achieved in similar order of 
magnitude, and faster than the photo-Fenton process. Finally, the removal of a 
viral pathogen indicator (MS2 bacteriophage) was attained at minute-range 
residence times. The aforementioned facts indicate the suitability of the mild, 
combined process, as a potential SODIS enhancement, producing safe drinking 
water for sunny and especially for developing countries.

Model coliphages (e.g., ΦX174, MS2, and PRD1) have been widely used as 
surrogates to study the fate and transport of pathogenic viruses in the 
environment and during wastewater treatment. Two groups of coliphages 
(F-specific and somatic) are being explored as indicators of viral fecal 
pollution in ambient water. However, the detection and quantification of 
coliphages still largely rely on time-consuming culture-based plaque assays. In 
this study, we developed an in-gel loop-mediated isothermal amplification 
(gLAMP) system enabling coliphage MS2 quantification within 30 min using 
standard laboratory devices. Viral particles (MS2) were immobilized with LAMP 
reagents in polyethylene glycol hydrogel, and then viral RNAs were amplified 
through a LAMP reaction. Due to the restriction effect of the hydrogel matrix, 
one viral particle would only produce one amplicon dot. Therefore, the sample 
virus concentrations can be determined based on the number of fluorescent 
amplicon dots using a smartphone for imaging. The method was validated by using 
artificially spiked and naturally contaminated water samples. gLAMP results were 
shown to correlate well with plaque assay counts ( R2 = 0.984, p < 0.05) and 
achieved similar sensitivity to quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase 
chain reaction (RT-qPCR; 1 plaque-forming unit per reaction). Moreover, gLAMP 
demonstrated a high level of tolerance against inhibitors naturally present in 
wastewater, in which RT-qPCR was completely inhibited. Besides MS2, gLAMP can 
also be used for the quantification of other microbial targets (e.g., 
Escherichia coli and Salmonella). Considering its simplicity, sensitivity, 
rapidity, and versatility, gLAMP holds great potential for microbial 
water-quality analysis, especially in resource-limited settings.

Peracetic acid (PAA) is a strong oxidant/bactericide that has been applied in 
various industries (e.g., food processing, pharmaceuticals, medical device 
sterilization, etc.) as a disinfectant. There is increasing interest in using 
PAA for wastewater disinfection because it does not form halogenated byproducts, 
and no post-treatment quenching is required. Previous studies have demonstrated 
good efficiency in controlling bacteria in wastewater, but limited information 
is available for viruses, especially those hosted by mammals (e.g., norovirus). 
Therefore, a study on the infectivity reduction of murine norovirus (MNV) was 
undertaken to evaluate the disinfection efficacy of PAA or UV alone and in 
combination with UV irradiation in undisinfected secondary effluent from a 
municipal wastewater reclamation facility (MWW) and phosphate buffer solution 
(PBS) at pH 7. Experiments employing MS2 bacteriophage were also performed in 
parallel for comparison purposes. MS2 infectivity reduction was found to be 
lower than MNV infectivity reduction for each condition studied - PAA, PAA + UV, 
and UV disinfection. These data suggest that MS2 may not be an appropriate 
surrogate to accurately predict the reduction of MNV infectivity. UV 
irradiation, in a dose range of 5-250 mJ/cm2, provided linear log inactivation 
(-log (N/N0)) with a regression slope (cm2mJ-1) of 0.031-0.034 and 0.165-0.202 
for MS2 and MNV, respectively. UV irradiation provided similar inactivation for 
MS2 and MNV in both suspensions (PBS or MWW). Low infectivity reduction of MS2 
was observed when PAA was used alone at a practical dose of 1.5 mg/L and below. 
A greater reduction of both MNV and MS2 was observed in PAA disinfection 
experiments using PBS as the microbial suspension medium, than in secondary 
effluent. Similar results were observed in PAA + UV experiments, in which 
greater synergistic effects were found in PBS than in MWW. Results of OH radical 
formation experiments suggest the presence of radical scavengers in MWW, which 
resulted in less opportunity for MNV and MS2 to encounter OHradicals. This study 
also demonstrated that the type of water can have a substantial impact on 
wastewater disinfection when employing PAA or PAA + UV treatment due to the 
matrix effect and the presence of radical scavengers, respectively. The results 
from this study could be employed to aid in the conceptual design of PAA and UV 
disinfection facilities, especially when norovirus is the organism of concern.

Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious disease of cloven-hoofed 
animals that has caused tremendous economic losses worldwide. In this study, we 
designed a chimeric nanoparticles (CNPs) vaccine that displays the predominant 
epitope of the serotype O foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) VP1 131-160 on the 
surface of MS2 phage. The recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia Coli 
and can self-assemble into CNPs with diameter at 25-30 nm in vitro. A tandem 
repeat peptide epitopes (TRE) was prepared as control. Mice were immunized with 
CNPs, TRE and commercialized synthetic peptide vaccines (PepVac), respectively. 
The ELISA results showed that CNPs stimulated a little higher specific antibody 
levels to PepVac, but was significantly higher than the TRE groups. Moreover, 
the results from specific IFN-γ responses and lymphocyte proliferation test 
indicated that CNP immunized mice exhibited significantly enhanced cellular 
immune response compared to TRE. These results suggested that the CNPs 
constructed in current study could be a potential alternative vaccine in future 
FMDV control.

The use of antibody conjugates for biomedical applications has garnered 
increased attention due to the ability of antibodies to specifically engage 
targets of interest. Despite these appealing qualities, the preparation of 
antibody-protein conjugates remains challenging. Here we detail an approach to 
attaching targeting antibodies to proteins of interest that combines advances in 
genetic code expansion and an efficient bioconjugation strategy. As an example, 
we prepare bacteriophage MS2 viral capsids bearing antibodies on their surfaces 
for applications in molecular targeting. This technique provides a modular 
framework to easily prepare antibody-MS2 conjugates in an efficient manner, even 
at low concentrations of the reacting biomolecules.

One of the hallmarks of virus-like particles (VLPs) is the fact that they 
possess distinguishable interior and exterior surfaces. Taking advantage of our 
knowledge of the amino acid location from X-ray crystal structures, we have 
developed a series of synthetic modifications of the MS2 bacteriophage viral 
capsid, including small molecule and polymer attachment, as well as conjugation 
with peptides, DNA and other proteins. These constructs have found applications 
in nanomaterial fabrication and as delivery vehicles with therapeutic potential. 
Importantly, the dual-modification strategies described herein could be extended 
to other VLP systems.

Enteric viruses and bacteriophages are exposed to various inactivating factors 
outside their host, and among them chlorine and heat are the most commonly used 
sanitizer in water industry and treatment in the food industry, respectively. 
Using MS2 phages as models for enteric viruses, we investigated the impact of 
free chlorine and heat on their physicochemical properties. Free chlorine was 
first evaluated alone. No increase in either capsid permeability or 
hydrophobicity was observed. The negative surface charge slightly increased 
suggesting molecular changes in the capsid. However, a weakening of the capsid 
by chlorine was suggested by differential scanning fluorimetry. This phenomenon 
was confirmed when chlorination was followed by a heat treatment. Indeed, an 
increase in the inactivation of MS2 phages and the permeability of their capsids 
to RNases was observed. More interestingly, an increase in the expression of 
hydrophobic domains at the phage surface was observed, but only for phages 
remaining infectious. The chlorine-caused weakening of the capsid suggested 
that, for an optimal use, the oxidant should be followed by heat. The increased 
permeability to RNases and the expression of hydrophobic domains may contribute 
to the development or improvement of molecular methods specific for infectious 
enteric viruses.

The survivability of viruses in natural and engineered systems impacts public 
health. Inactivation mechanisms in the environment have been described for 
nonenveloped viruses, but it remains unclear how the membrane layer of enveloped 
viruses influences inactivation. We applied molecular tools and high-resolution 
mass spectrometry to measure reactions in the genome, proteins, and lipids of 
enveloped Pseudomonas phage Phi6 during inactivation by free chlorine and UV254. 
Free chlorine readily penetrated the lipid membrane to react with proteins in 
the nucleocapsid and polymerase complex. The most reactive Phi6 peptides were 
approximately 150 times more reactive with free chlorine than the most reactive 
peptides reported in nonenveloped coliphage MS2. The inactivation kinetics of 
Phi6 by UV254 was comparable with those of nonenveloped adenovirus and coliphage 
MS2 and were driven by UV254 reactions with viral genomes. Our research 
identifies molecular features of an enveloped virus that are susceptible to 
chemical oxidants or UV radiation. Finally, the framework developed in the 
manuscript for studying molecular reactivities of Phi6 can be adopted to 
investigate enveloped virus survivability under various environmental 
conditions.

Bacteriophages of the Leviviridae family are small viruses with short 
single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genomes. Protein-RNA interactions play a key role 
throughout the phage life cycle, and all of the conserved phage proteins - the 
maturation protein, the coat protein and the replicase - are able to recognize 
specific structures in the RNA genome. The phage-coded replicase subunit 
associates with several host proteins to form a catalytically active complex. 
Recognition of the genomic RNA by the replicase complex is achieved in a 
remarkably complex manner that exploits the RNA-binding properties of host 
proteins and the particular three-dimensional structure of the phage genome. The 
coat protein recognizes a hairpin structure at the beginning of the replicase 
gene. The binding interaction serves to regulate the expression of the replicase 
gene and can be remarkably different in various ssRNA phages. The maturation 
protein is a minor structural component of the virion that binds to the genome, 
mediates attachment to the host and guides the genome into the cell. The 
maturation protein has two distinct RNA-binding surfaces that are in contact 
with different regions of the genome. The maturation and coat proteins also work 
together to ensure the encapsidation of the phage genome in new virus particles. 
In this chapter, the different ssRNA phage protein-RNA interactions, as well as 
some of their practical applications, are discussed in detail.

OBJECTIVE: To explore detecting methods and quality control standard system for 
hepatitis A virus( HAV) in water for fruits and vegetables production.
METHODS: 100 μL of coliphage MS2( 2. 5 × 10~9 pfu / mL) was added into each 
water sample, and positively charged membrane filter method was used to capture 
virus. The virus extraction efficiency of each sample can be calculated 
according to standard curve of coliphage. Then the quality control system and 
real-time RT-PCR method were established.
RESULTS: This research compared the extraction efficiency of HAV and coliphage 
MS2 which were added into the water samples at the same time. The extraction 
efficiency of HAV was from 1. 24% to 32. 68%, and coliphage MS2 1. 64% to 14. 
24%. The efficiency met the requirements of ISO / TS 15216-2-2013. Meanwhile, 
the HAV in 30 water samples were detected, and one was positive. The extraction 
efficiency of coliphage MS2 was from1. 24% to 24. 19%, and the standard 
deviation was 0. 0612.
CONCLUSION: This research establish a quality control system to ensure the 
quality of test results.

Viruses cause serious pathogenic contamination that severely affects the 
environment and human health. Cold atmospheric-pressure plasma efficiently 
inactivates pathogenic bacteria; however, the mechanism of virus inactivation by 
plasma is not fully understood. In this study, surface plasma in argon mixed 
with 1% air and plasma-activated water was used to treat water containing 
bacteriophages. Both agents efficiently inactivated bacteriophages T4, Φ174, and 
MS2 in a time-dependent manner. Prolonged storage had marginal effects on the 
antiviral activity of plasma-activated water. DNA and protein analysis revealed 
that the reactive species generated by plasma damaged both nucleic acids and 
proteins, consistent with the morphological examination showing that plasma 
treatment caused the aggregation of bacteriophages. The inactivation of 
bacteriophages was alleviated by the singlet oxygen scavengers, demonstrating 
that singlet oxygen played a primary role in this process. Our findings provide 
a potentially effective disinfecting strategy to combat the environmental 
viruses using cold atmospheric-pressure plasma and plasma-activated 
water.IMPORTANCE Contamination with pathogenic and infectious viruses severely 
threatens human health and animal husbandry. Current methods for disinfection 
have different disadvantages, such as inconvenience and contamination of 
disinfection by-products (e.g., chlorine disinfection). In this study, 
atmospheric surface plasma in argon mixed with air and plasma-activated water 
was found to efficiently inactivate bacteriophages, and plasma-activated water 
still had strong antiviral activity after prolonged storage. Furthermore, it was 
shown that bacteriophage inactivation was associated with damage to nucleic 
acids and proteins by singlet oxygen. An understanding of the biological effects 
of plasma-based treatment is useful to inform the development of plasma into a 
novel disinfecting strategy with convenience and no by-product.

The advantages of polychromatic ultraviolet (UV) light for viral disinfection 
can be optimized for disinfection using emerging tailored wavelength sources 
including KrCl excimer lamps and light emitting diodes (LEDs). Disinfection of 
the common viral surrogate MS2 bacteriophage was measured after exposure to 
these emerging sources and conventional low pressure (LP) mercury UV lamps in 
individual or sequential exposures. The first dose response for any virus (MS2) 
exposed to a KrCl excimer lamp is reported, showing the high efficiency of 
fluence-based disinfection because of increased viral susceptibility at the low 
wavelengths emitted by the excilamp. Sequential exposure dose responses 
indicated synergy from sequential exposures of LP and excimer lamps, which were 
competitive on an electrical basis at worst-and best-case scenarios of wall plug 
efficiency with current medium pressure (MP) disinfection. Best-case scenarios 
for electrical efficiency also showed all sequential exposures to be competitive 
with MP UV disinfection. Predictive models for sequential exposure dose 
responses were assessed to support the current feasibility of incorporating 
sequential UV exposures to optimize tailored wavelength viral disinfection.

[Preparation and Characterization of Recombinant HEV RNA-loaded MS2 
Bacteriophage Capsid by Armored RNA Technology].

[Article in Chinese]

Liu Y, Wang S, Zhou T, Gao S.

The purpose of this study was to develop an effective control to be applied in 
hepatitis E virus(HEV)nucleic acid detection.Construction of an MS2/HEV gene was 
performed based on an "Armored RNA technology" protocol. The gene included a 
partial MS2 phage genome including the 5’UTR,the maturation protein, capsid 
protein and initiation site of the replicase and a partially conserved sequence 
derived from the HEV ORF2.The target genes were synthesized and amplified by 
PCR, and the purified target gene products subcloned into the pET-28 b 
prokaryotic expression vector to obtain the pET-28b-MS2/HEV recombinant plasmid. 
SDS-PAGE was used for expression analysis in E. coli BL21(DE3)cells harboring 
the pET-28b-MS2/HEV plasmid. Centrifugal ultrafiltration was adopted for the 
purification and concentration of recombinant HEV RNA-loaded MS2 Bacteriophage 
Capsid (rHEPC). The morphological identification of the particles was 
subsequently performed by scanning electron microscopy. Stability of the rHEPC 
particles were evaluated by challenging with different concentrations of DNase I 
and RNase A, and also evaluated for long-term storage based on RT-PCR 
verification. SDS-PAGE results showed that the target MS2/HEV gene could express 
efficiently in recombinant E. coli BL21(DE3)and RT-PCR results revealed that the 
designed HEV conserved gene sequence was successfully packaged into 
MS2phage-like or rHEPC particles. Stability evaluation showed that the prepared 
rHEPC particles exhibited strong resistance to degradation by DNase I and RNase 
A and long-lasting protection of coated HEV RNA for at least seven months when 
stored at-20℃.The prepared rHEPC particles in the present study meet the basic 
requirements to be used as a quality control material for routine HEV nucleic 
acid detection.

The study of bacteriophages (phages) and prophages has provided key insights 
into almost every cellular process as well as led to the discovery of unexpected 
new mechanisms and the development of valuable tools. This is exemplified for 
RNA-based regulation. For instance, the characterization and exploitation of the 
antiphage CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat) 
systems is revolutionizing molecular biology. Phage-encoded proteins such as the 
RNA-binding MS2 protein, which is broadly used to isolate tagged RNAs, also have 
been developed as valuable tools. Hfq, the RNA chaperone protein central to the 
function of many base-pairing small RNAs (sRNAs), was first characterized as a 
bacterial host factor required for Qβ phage replication. The ongoing studies of 
RNAs are continuing to reveal regulatory connections between infecting phages, 
prophages, and bacteria and to provide novel insights. There are bacterial and 
prophage sRNAs that regulate prophage genes, which impact bacterial virulence as 
well as bacterial cell killing. Conversely, phage- and prophage-encoded sRNAs 
modulate the expression of bacterial genes modifying metabolism. An interesting 
subcategory of the prophage-encoded sRNAs are sponge RNAs that inhibit the 
activities of bacterial-encoded sRNAs. Phages also affect posttranscriptional 
regulation in bacteria through proteins that inhibit or alter the activities of 
key bacterial proteins involved in posttranscriptional regulation. However, what 
is most exciting about phage and prophage research, given the millions of 
phage-encoded genes that have not yet been characterized, is the vast potential 
for discovering new RNA regulators and novel mechanisms and for gaining insight 
into the evolution of regulatory RNAs.

Despite recent efforts in modernization of water treatment facilities, the 
problem of access to healthy drinking water for hundreds of millions of people 
has still not been solved. A water filter based on Cu-coated nanofibrillated 
cellulose with controlled porosity was prepared by the "paper-making" method. We 
have optimized the proper mass and ratio of functionalized and pure 
nanofibrillated cellulose for the preparation of the filter. MS2 bacteriophages 
were used to model human pathogenic virions. We tested our filter material in 
batch experiments and the fixed filters in flow experiments. The fabricated 
Cu-coated nanofibrillated cellulose filters were characterized by scanning 
electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, specific surface area measurement 
(Brunauer-Emmett-Teller), dynamic light scattering, and inductively coupled 
plasma mass spectroscopy. Our measurements proved that the fixation of cellulose 
nanofibers plays a significant role in the degree of virus retention and it 
greatly enhances the efficiency of the filtration. By using these functionalized 
water filters, we were able to achieve a virus retention of at least 5 
magnitudes (5Log) at three different pH values: 5.0, 7.5, and 9.

The assembly and maturation of viruses with icosahedral capsids must be 
coordinated with icosahedral symmetry. The icosahedral symmetry imposes also the 
restrictions on the cooperative specific interactions between genomic RNA/DNA 
and coat proteins that should be reflected in quasi-regular segmentation of 
viral genomic sequences. Combining discrete direct and double Fourier 
transforms, we studied the quasi-regular large-scale segmentation in genomic 
sequences of different ssRNA, ssDNA, and dsDNA viruses. The particular 
representatives included satellite tobacco mosaic virus (STMV) and the strains 
of satellite tobacco necrosis virus (STNV), STNV-C, STNV-1, STNV-2, Escherichia 
phages MS2, ϕX174, α3, and HK97, and Simian virus 40. In all their genomes, we 
found the significant quasi-regular segmentation of genomic sequences related to 
the virion assembly and the genome packaging within icosahedral capsid. We also 
found good correspondence between our results and available cryo-electron 
microscopy data on capsid structures and genome packaging in these viruses. 
Fourier analysis of genomic sequences provides the additional insight into 
mechanisms of hierarchical genome packaging and may be used for verification of 
the concepts of 3-fold or 5-fold intermediates in virion assembly. The results 
of sequence analysis should be taken into account at the choice of models and 
data interpretation. They also may be helpful for the development of antiviral 
drugs.

Research on microorganism reduction by physicochemical water treatment is often 
carried out under the assumption that the microbiological enumeration techniques 
are not affected by the presence of coagulants. Data presented here indicate 
that bacteriophage enumeration by plaque assay and RT-qPCR (reverse 
transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction) can be affected by these 
water treatment chemicals. Treatment of water samples with an alkaline 
protein-rich solution prior to plaque assay and optimization of RNA extraction 
for RT-qPCR were implemented to minimize the interference. The improved 
procedures were used in order to investigate reduction of three viral pathogens 
and the MS2 model virus in the presence of three coagulants. A conventional 
aluminium coagulant was compared to alternative agents (zirconium and chitosan) 
in a coagulation-filtration system. The highest virus reduction, i.e., 
99.9-99.99%, was provided by chitosan, while aluminium and zirconium reduced 
virus by 99.9% in colour-rich water and by 90% in water with less colour, 
implying an effect of coagulant type and raw water quality on virus reduction. 
Although charge characteristics of viruses were associated with virus reduction, 
the results reveal that the MS2 phage is a suitable model for aggregation and 
retention of the selected pathogens.

Over four billion people are discharging untreated human excreta into the 
environment without any prior treatment, causing eutrophication and spreading 
disease. The most nutrient rich fraction is the urine. Urine can be collected 
separately and dehydrated in an alkaline bed producing a nutrient rich 
fertiliser. However, faecal cross-contamination during the collection risks to 
introduce pathogens to the urine. The objective of this hygiene assessment was 
to study the inactivation of five microorganisms (Ascaris suum, Enterococcus 
faecalis, bacteriophages MS2 and ΦX 174 and Salmonella spp) in alkaline 
dehydrated urine. Fresh human urine was dehydrated in wood ash at 42 °C until 
the pH decreased to ≤10.5, at which point the saturated ash was inoculated with 
faeces containing the microorganisms and left open to the air (mimicking 
stockpiling of the end product) at temperatures of 20 and 42 °C. The bacteria 
and bacteriophages were inactivated to below the detection limit (100 cfu ml-1 
for bacteria; 10 pfu mL-1 for bacteriophages) within four days storage at 20 °C. 
A. suum inactivation data was fitted to a non-linear regression model, which 
estimated a required 325 days of storage at 20 °C and 9.2 days at 42 °C to reach 
a 3 log10 reduction. However, the urine dehydration in itself achieved a 
concentration <1 A. suum per 4 g of dehydrated medium which fulfil the WHO 
guidelines for unrestricted use.

Phages are natural predators of bacteria and have been exploited in bacterial 
detection because of their exquisite specificity to their cognate bacterial 
hosts. In this study, we present a "proof of concept" bacteriophage 
amplification-coupled assay as a surrogate for detecting a bacterium present in 
a sample. The assay entails detection of progeny phage resulting from infection 
and subsequent growth inside the bacterium present in suspected samples. This 
approach reduces testing time and enhances sensitivity to identify pathogens 
compared to traditional overnight plaque assay. Further, the assay has the 
ability to discriminate between live and dead cells since phages require live 
host cells to infect and replicate. To demonstrate its utility, phage MS2 
amplification-coupled, bead-based sandwich type immunoassay on the Luminex® 
MAGPIX instrument for Escherichia coli detection was performed. The assay not 
only showed live cell discrimination ability but also a limit of E. coli 
detection of 1 × 102 cells/mL of live cells after a 3-h incubation. In addition, 
the sensitivity of the assay was not impaired in the presence of dead cells. 
These results demonstrate that bacteriophage amplification-coupled assay can be 
a rapid live cell detection assay compared to traditional culture methods and a 
promising tool for quick validation of bacterial inactivation. Combined with the 
unique multiplex bead chemistry of the Luminex® MAGPIX platform, the phage assay 
can be expanded to be an ultra-deep multiplex assay for the simultaneous 
detection of multiple pathogens using specific phages directed against the 
target pathogens.

The present study evaluated anaerobic co-digestion of swine manure and swine 
carcasses for biogas yield and inactivation/behaviour of pathogens purpose. 
Biochemical Methane Production tests were performed with samples containing 
ratios of 3, 7.5 and 15 kgcarcass m-3 manure. For pathogens inactivation 
experiments known amounts of model microrganisms (sensitive and resistant) were 
artificially inoculated in anaerobic reactors at 24°C and 37°C. The addition of 
carcass resulted in an increase until 119% of biogas yield compared to swine 
manure mono-digestion. Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli and PCV2 were 
reduced >3log10 (24°C or 37°C) during 30 days. At 37°C, MS2 and PhiX-174 were 
reduced 3log10 and 1.8log10, respectively. At 24°C, MS2 reduced 1.5 log10 and 
PhiX-174 did not present any decay over 30 days. Considering the most resistant 
biomarkers pathogens, as bacteriophage, we recommend the swine carcasses 
pre-treatment, such as high temperatures, for sanitary security.

Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is widely used to determine 
high-resolution structures of symmetric virus capsids. The method holds promise 
for extending studies beyond purified capsids and their symmetric protein 
shells. The non-symmetric genome component has been addressed in dsRNA 
cypoviruses and ssRNA bacteriophages Qβ and MS2. The structure of human herpes 
simplex virus type 1 capsids has been determined within intact virions to 
resolve capsid-tegument interactions. Electron tomography under cryogenic 
conditions (cryo-ET), has allowed resolving an early membrane fusion 
intermediate of Rift Valley fever virus. Antibody-affinity based sample grids 
allow capturing of virions directly from cell cultures or even clinical samples. 
These and other emerging methods will support studies to address viral entry, 
assembly and neutralization processes at increasingly high resolutions and 
native conditions.

New disinfection procedures are being developed and proposed for use in 
drinking-water production. Authorising their use requires an effective test 
strategy that can simulate conditions in practice. For this purpose, we 
developed a test rig working in a flow-through mode similar to the disinfection 
procedures in waterworks, but under tightly defined conditions, including very 
short contact times. To quantify the influence of DOC, temperature and pH on the 
efficacy of two standard disinfectants, chlorine and chlorine dioxide, simulated 
use tests were systematically performed. This test rig enabled quantitative 
comparison of the reduction of four test organisms, two viruses and two 
bacteria, in response to disinfection. Chlorine was substantially more effective 
against Enterococcus faecium than chlorine dioxide whereas the latter was more 
effective against the bacteriophage MS2, especially at pH values of >7.5 at 
which chlorine efficacies already decline. Contrary to expectation, bacteria 
were not generally reduced more quickly than viruses. Overall, the results 
confirm a high efficacy of chlorine and chlorine dioxide, validating them as 
standard disinfectants for assessing the efficacy of new disinfectants. 
Furthermore, these data demonstrate that the test rig is an appropriate tool for 
testing new disinfectants as well as disinfection procedures.

Pond walls: inclined planes to improve pathogen removal in pond systems for 
wastewater treatment?

Attenuation of sunlight in wastewater treatment ponds reduces the depth of the 
water exposed to disinfecting irradiances. Shallow pond depth with paddlewheel 
rotation increases exposure of pathogens to sunlight in high rate algal ponds. 
Generation of thin films, using pond walls as inclined planes, may increase 
inactivation of pathogens by increasing sunlight exposure. The performance of a 
laboratory based model system incorporating an inclined plane (IP) was 
evaluated. F-RNA bacteriophage, in tap water or wastewater, was exposed to 
sunlight only on the IP with the bulk water incubated in the dark. MS2 
inactivation was significantly higher when the IP was present (P < 0.05) with a 
63% increase observed. Prolonged exposure increased MS2 die-off irrespective of 
IP presence. Versatility of the IP was also demonstrated with faster 
inactivation observed in both optically clear tap water and wastewaters. IPs of 
different surface areas produced similar inactivation rates when operated at 
similar hydraulic loading rates regardless of slope length.

Ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (UV-LEDs) with peak emission wavelengths of 
265, 280 and 300 nm were applied for the inactivation of feline calicivirus 
(FCV) in water, and the results were compared to those derived with a common 
viral surrogate coliphage MS2. The fluence response profiles indicated that the 
log10-based inactivation rate constant of FCV was 0.113, 0.101 and 0.007 cm2 
mJ-1 for the 265, 280 and 300 nm UV-LEDs, respectively, while that of MS2 was 
0.034, 0.033 and 0.003 cm2 mJ-1 for the 265, 280 and 300 nm UV-LEDs, 
respectively. Namely, FCV was about two to three times more sensitive than MS2 
to germicidal UV emissions adopted in this study, and the 265 nm and 280 nm 
UV-LEDs were particularly effective to inactivate FCV. Results of this study are 
to be a part of database on fluence response profiles of various microorganisms, 
which would foster the development of disinfection apparatuses equipped with 
UV-LEDs.

  A series of full-scale testing was performed at the City of Lathrop 
Consolidated Treatment Facility to determine the "concentration times time" (Ct) 
value for free chlorine disinfection of nitrified membrane bioreactor (MBR) 
effluent to achieve more than 5-log virus inactivation. The full-scale testing 
consisted of tracer study, chlorine decay study, and virus seeding study. The 
virus seeding study was performed at a flow rate of 1 million gal/d (3800 
m3/min), which corresponded to a theoretical contact time of 117 minutes in the 
chlorine contact basin. It was found that Ct values as small as 3 mg·min/L were 
sufficient to achieve 5-log inactivation of MS2 bacteriophage in this study, 
which is comparable to the results of previous bench- and pilot-scale free 
chlorine disinfection studies on nitrified MBR effluent (3 to 40 mg·min/L), as 
well as those of pilot- and full-scale studies on granular media-filtered 
nitrified effluent (2 to 22 mg·min/L).

BACKGROUND: Halting the spread of harmful microbes requires an understanding of 
their transmission via hands and fomites. Previous studies explored acute and 
long-term care environments but not outpatient clinics. Objectives of this study 
were to track microbial movement throughout an outpatient clinic and evaluate 
the impact of a disinfectant spray intervention targeting high-touch point 
surfaces.
METHODS: At the start of the clinic day, a harmless viral tracer was placed onto 
2 fomites: a patient room door handle and front desk pen. Patient care, 
cleaning, and hand hygiene practices continued as usual. Facility fomites 
(n = 19), staff hands (n = 4), and patient hands (n = 3-4) were sampled after 2, 
3.5, and 6 hours. Tracer concentrations at baseline (before intervention) were 
evaluated 6 hours after seeding. For the intervention trials, high-touch 
surfaces were cleaned 4 hours after seeding with an ethanol-based disinfectant 
and sampled 2 hours after cleaning.
RESULTS: At 2, 3.5, and 6 hours after seeding, virus was detected on all 
surfaces and hands sampled, with examination room door handles and nurses' 
station chair arms yielding the highest concentrations. Virus concentrations 
decreased by 94.1% after the disinfectant spray intervention (P = .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Microbes spread quickly in an outpatient clinic, reaching maximum 
contamination levels 2 hours after inoculation, with the highest contamination 
on examination room door handles and nurses' station chairs. This study 
emphasizes the importance of targeted disinfection of high-touch surfaces.

Indirect exposure to waterborne viruses increases the risk of infection, 
especially among children with frequent hand-to-mouth contacts. Here, we 
quantified the transfer of one bacteriophage (MS2) and two enteric viruses 
(adenovirus and coxsackievirus) from liquid to skin. MS2, a commonly used 
enteric virus surrogate, was used to compare virus transfer rates in a volunteer 
trial to those obtained using human cadaver skin and synthetic skin. MS2 
transfer to volunteer skin was similar to transfer to cadaver skin but 
significantly different from transfer to synthetic skin. The transfer of MS2, 
adenovirus, and coxsackievirus to cadaver skin was modeled using measurements 
for viruses attaching to the skin (adsorbed) and viruses in liquid residual on 
skin (unadsorbed). We find virus transfer per surface area is a function of the 
concentration of virus in the liquid and the film thickness of liquid retained 
on the skin and is estimable using a linear model. Notably, the amount of MS2 
adsorbed on the skin was on average 5 times higher than the amount of adenovirus 
and 4 times higher than the amount of coxsackievirus. Quantification of 
pathogenic virus retention to skin would thus be overestimated using MS2 
adsorption data. This study provides models of virus transfer useful for risk 
assessments of water-related activities, demonstrates significant differences in 
the transfer of pathogenic virus and MS2, and suggests cadaver skin as an 
alternative testing system for studying interactions between viruses and 
skin.IMPORTANCE Enteric viruses (viruses that infect the gastrointestinal tract) 
are responsible for most water-transmitted diseases. They are shed in high 
concentrations in the feces of infected individuals, persist for an extended 
period of time in water, and are highly infective. Exposure to contaminated 
water directly (through ingestion) or indirectly (for example, through 
hand-water contacts followed by hand-to-mouth contacts) increases the risk of 
virus transmission. The work described herein provides a quantitative model for 
estimating human-pathogenic virus retention on skin following contact with 
contaminated water. The work will be important in refining the contribution of 
indirect transmission of virus to risks associated with water-related 
activities.

The MS2 system has been widely used, in organisms ranging from bacteria to 
higher eukaryotes, to image single mRNAs in intact cells with high precision. We 
have recently re-engineered the MS2 system for accurate detection of mRNAs in 
living Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Previous MS2 systems affected the degradation 
of the tagged mRNA, which led to accumulation of MS2 fragments and to erroneous 
conclusions about mRNA localization and expression. Here we describe a 
step-by-step protocol for the use of our latest MS2 system (MBSV6) for detecting 
endogenously tagged mRNAs using wide-field fluorescent microscopy in living 
yeast. The procedure is divided into three stages: tagging of endogenous gene 
with MBSV6 (~2 weeks), a two-color single-molecule RNA fluorescent in situ 
hybridization (smFISH) procedure to quantitatively assess whether mRNAs tagged 
with MS2 and MS2-coat protein (MCP) behave like untagged mRNAs (2 d, plus 
additional time for quantification), and a procedure to quantify single mRNAs by 
live imaging using wide-field microscopy (1 d, plus additional time for 
quantification). With this method it is now possible to interrogate all phases 
of mRNA expression, from transcription through decay. The described protocol is 
designed for S. cerevisiae; however, we think that our approach and the 
considerations discussed here can be extended to Escherichia coli, Drosophila, 
Caenorhabditis elegans, and mammalian cells.

We determined the potential interference of extracellular algal organic matter 
(EAOM) and intracellular algal organic matter (IAOM) extracted from Microcystis 
aeruginosa on MS2 bacteriophage inactivation under UV irradiation at two 
wavelengths (220 and 254 nm). UV irradiation at 220 nm doubled the inactivation 
rate of MS2 in water containing EAOM than in organic-free phosphate buffered 
solution. In contrast, EAOM did not change MS2 inactivation by exposure to UV 
254 nm. The presence of IAOM did not significantly influence MS2 inactivation by 
exposure to either UV 254 or UV 220 nm. To achieve 3 log10 inactivation of MS2, 
UV254 nm required more than double the dose of UV220 nm (45 mJ/cm2 vs. 
20 mJ/cm2). Linear correlations between the reduction in infectivity and the 
reduction in genome copies detected by reverse transcription quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction suggested that genomic damage is the main mechanism 
responsible for MS2 inactivation in water containing algal organic matter (AOM) 
by exposure to UV irradiation. These findings suggest that the presence of AOM 
did not negatively influence MS2 inactivation by either 220 or 254 nm 
irradiation, and that a lower UV dose of 220 nm irradiation can be used to 
achieve the same level of inactivation in water containing AOM.

RNA tracking allows researchers to visualize RNA molecules in cells and tissues, 
providing important spatio-temporal information regarding RNA dynamics and 
function. Methods such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and molecular 
beacons rely on complementary oligonucleotides to label and view endogenous 
transcripts. Other methods create artificial chimeric transcripts coupled with 
bacteriophage-derived coat proteins (e.g. MS2, λN) to tag molecules in live 
cells. In other approaches, endogenous RNAs are recognized by complementary RNAs 
complexed with noncatalytic Cas proteins. Each technique has its own set of 
strengths and limitations that must be considered when planning an experiment. 
Here, we discuss the mechanisms, advantages, and weaknesses of in situ 
hybridization, molecular beacons, MS2 tagging and Cas-derived systems, as well 
as how RNA tracking can be employed to study various aspects of molecular 
biology.

UVA and UVB can be applied to solar disinfection of water. In this study, the 
inactivation and photoreactivation of viruses and bacteria in the UVA-B range 
were analyzed. MS2 and T4 bacteriophages, and Escherichia coli were used as 
surrogates to quantify dose-response behaviors. Inactivation in UVC was used to 
validate the methodology and to expand the inactivation action spectra. The 
results showed log-linear inactivation for MS2 and T4 in the 254-320 nm 
wavelength range. T4 inactivation was consistently faster than MS2 (except at 
320 nm), and for both phages, inactivation decreased with increasing wavelength. 
The dose-response of bacteria exhibited a lag at low doses, possibly because the 
photons must strike a discrete number of critical targets before growth stops. A 
tail was present at high doses for some wavelengths, perhaps due to clumping or 
the presence of subgroups with higher resistance. The inactivation action 
spectra for bacteria exhibited a reduction in inactivation as wavelength 
increased. No bacterial inactivation was observed beyond 320 nm at doses 
applied. After inactivation at 297 nm (UVA), bacteria regained viability through 
photoreactivation, and repair increased with increase in photoreactivating light 
exposure time. This implies additional doses above inactivation thresholds are 
required to cause irreversible damage. These results are useful for designing 
solar disinfection systems.

Dielectrophoresis (DEP) is usually effective close to the electrode surface. 
Several techniques have been developed to overcome its drawbacks and to enhance 
dielectrophoretic particle capture. Here we present a simple technique of 
superimposing alternating current DEP (high-frequency signals) and 
electroosmosis (EO; low-frequency signals) between two coplanar electrodes (gap: 
25 μm) using a lab-made voltage adder for rapid and selective concentration of 
bacteria, viruses, and proteins, where we controlled the voltages and 
frequencies of DEP and EO separately. This signal superimposition technique 
enhanced bacterial capture (Escherichia coli K-12 against 1-μm-diameter 
polystyrene beads) more selectively (>99%) and rapidly (~30 s) at lower DEP (5 
Vpp) and EO (1.2 Vpp) potentials than those used in the conventional DEP capture 
studies. Nanometer-sized MS2 viruses and troponin I antibody proteins were also 
concentrated using the superimposed signals, and significantly more MS2 and 
cTnI-Ab were captured using the superimposed signals than the DEP (10 Vpp) or EO 
(2 Vpp) signals alone (p < 0.035) between the two coplanar electrodes and at a 
short exposure time (1 min). This technique has several advantages, such as 
simplicity and low cost of electrode fabrication, rapid and large collection 
without electrolysis.

We recently reported the photodynamic inactivation (PDI) of bacteriophage MS2 
with a photosensitiser- 5, 10, 15, 20-tetrakis (1-methyl-4-pyridinio) porphyrin- 
tetra- p-toluene sulfonate (TMPyP) in solution and concluded that the A-protein 
of the virus is the main target of inactivation. Here, we have extended these 
studies and carried out PDI of bacteriophage Qβ, bovine enterovirus 2 (BEV-2) 
and type 1 murine norovirus (MNV-1). The rate of inactivation observed was in 
the order MS2 > Qβ > MNV-1 > BEV-2. Data suggested that TMPyP-treatment could 
also target the viral genome as well as result in disintegration/disassembly of 
viral particles. Although emergence of viral drug resistance is a 
well-documented phenomenon, it was not possible to generate PDI-resistant MS2. 
However, emergence of a mutation in the lysis protein was detected after serial 
exposure to PDI.

Coliphages can indicate contamination of recreational waters and previous 
studies show that sunlight is important in altering densities of coliphages, 
other indicator microorganisms, and pathogens in aquatic environments. Here, we 
report on laboratory studies of light-induced inactivation of two coliphage 
groups-male-specific (F+) and somatic coliphage-under various conditions in 
phosphate-buffered water (PBW). Strains isolated from wastewater treatment 
facilities and laboratory strains (MS2 and phiX174 coliphages) were evaluated. 
Inactivation rates were determined in a series of irradiations using simulated 
solar radiation passed through light filters that blocked different parts of the 
ultraviolet spectral region. Inactivation rates and spectral irradiance from 
these experiments were then analyzed to develop biological weighting functions 
(BWFs) for the light-induced inactivation. BWFs were used to model the 
inactivation of coliphages over a range of conditions in aquatic environments 
that included two beach sites in Lake Michigan and one in Lake Erie. For 
example, modeled effects of sunlight attenuation, using UV absorption data from 
the three Great Lakes beach sites, inferred that direct photoinactivation rate 
constants, averaged over a one-meter water column in swimmable areas, were 
reduced 2- to 5-fold, compared to near-surface rate constants.

We study translation repression in bacteria by engineering a regulatory circuit 
that functions as a binding assay for RNA binding proteins (RBP) in vivo. We do 
so by inducing expression of a fluorescent protein-RBP chimera, together with 
encoding its binding site at various positions within the ribosomal initiation 
region (+11-13 nt from the AUG) of a reporter module. We show that when bound by 
their cognate RBPs, the phage coat proteins for PP7 (PCP) and Qβ (QCP), strong 
repression is observed for all hairpin positions within the initiation region. 
Yet, a sharp transition to no-effect is observed when positioned in the 
elongation region, at a single-nucleotide resolution. Employing in vivo 
Selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension followed by 
sequencing (SHAPE-seq) for a representative construct, established that in the 
translationally active state the mRNA molecule is nonstructured, while in the 
repressed state a structured signature was detected. We then utilize this 
regulatory phenomena to quantify the binding affinity of the coat proteins of 
phages MS2, PP7, GA, and Qβ to 14 cognate and noncognate binding sites in vivo. 
Using our circuit, we demonstrate qualitative differences between in vitro to in 
vivo binding characteristics for various variants when comparing to past 
studies. Furthermore, by introducing a simple mutation to the loop region for 
the Qβ-wt site, MCP binding is abolished, creating the first high-affinity QCP 
site that is completely orthogonal to MCP. Consequently, we demonstrate that our 
hybrid transcriptional-post-transcriptional circuit can be utilized as a binding 
assay to quantify RNA-RBP interactions in vivo.

In general, the last step in the vegetative cycle of bacterial viruses, or 
bacteriophages, is lysis of the host. dsDNA phages require multiple lysis 
proteins, including at least one enzyme that degrades the cell wall 
(peptidoglycan (PG)). In contrast, the lytic ssDNA and ssRNA phages have a 
single lysis protein that achieves cell lysis without enzymatically degrading 
the PG. Here, we review four "single-gene lysis" or Sgl proteins. Three of the 
Sgls block bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to and inhibiting several 
enzymes in the PG precursor pathway. The target of the fourth Sgl, L from 
bacteriophage MS2, is still unknown, but we review evidence indicating that it 
is likely a protein involved in maintaining cell wall integrity. Although only a 
few phage genomes are available to date, the ssRNA Leviviridae are a rich source 
of novel Sgls, which may facilitate further unraveling of bacterial cell wall 
biosynthesis and discovery of new antibacterial agents.

The paper presents the first study to date on selective label-free biosensing 
with a microcavity in-line Mach-Zehnder interferometer induced in an optical 
fiber. The sensing structures were fabricated in a single-mode fiber by 
femtosecond laser micromachining. In contrast to other studies of this sensing 
scheme, where only the sensitivity to refractive index changes in the cavity was 
investigated, this research used chemical surface treatment of the sensor to 
ensure detection specificity. Immobilized MS2 bacteriophages were applied as 
recognition elements specifically targeting live E. coli C3000 bacteria. It is 
shown that the sensor allows for real-time monitoring of biological phenomena 
taking place on the surface of the microcavity. The developed biosensor exhibits 
ultrahigh refractive index sensitivity of 15,000 nm/RIU and is capable of 
detecting live E. coli bacteria concentrations as low as 100 colony forming 
units (CFU)/mL in liquid volume as low as picoliters.

Foodborne illnesses caused by norovirus contaminated fresh produce remain a food 
safety concern worldwide. In the present study, the impacts of commercial and 
home processing conditions of strawberries were evaluated for inactivation of 
the MS2 bacteriophage. MS2 was used as a surrogate of norovirus and was spot 
inoculated onto strawberries to achieve 6.6 log PFU/g. The inoculated 
strawberries were washed with tap water, electrolyzed water, or 50 ppm chlorine 
for 90 s prior to and after storage. After initial washing, the strawberries 
were separately stored at -20 °C and -80 °C for 30 days. Change in MS2 
populations on strawberries was evaluated by plaque assay method on day 1, 15, 
and 30 for -20 °C and -80 °C groups. The results showed that washing 
strawberries prior to storage resulted in a significant decrease (approximately 
1 log PFU/g) of MS2 population regardless of the treatment (p < 0.05). Frozen 
storage had minor effects on inactivating MS2, which resulted in approximately a 
0.5 log PFU/g reduction at the end of storage. Washing frozen berries in 
electrolyzed water or 50 ppm chlorine on day 30 resulted in an additional 
1 log PFU/g decrease in MS2 compared to water alone. These results suggest that 
washing strawberries with a chemical antimicrobial prior to and post frozen 
storage may enhance microbial safety.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an enteric virus divided into eight genotypes. 
Genotype 1 (G1) and G2 are specific to humans; G3, G4 and G7 are zoonotic 
genotypes infecting humans and animals. Transmission to humans through water has 
been demonstrated for G1 and G2, mainly in developing countries, but is only 
suspected for the zoonotic genotypes. Thus, the water-related HEV hazard may be 
due to human and animal faeces. The high HEV genetic variability allows 
considering the presence in wastewater of not only different genotypes, but also 
quasispecies adding even greater diversity. Moreover, recent studies have 
demonstrated that HEV particles may be either quasi-enveloped or non-enveloped, 
potentially implying differential viral behaviours in the environment. The 
presence of HEV has been demonstrated at the different stages of the water cycle 
all over the world, especially for HEV G3 in Europe and the USA. Concerning HEV 
survival in water, the virus does not have higher resistance to inactivating 
factors (heat, UV, chlorine, physical removal), compared to viral indicators 
(MS2 phage) or other highly resistant enteric viruses (Hepatitis A virus). But 
the studies did not take into account genetic (genogroups, quasispecies) or 
structural (quasi- or non-enveloped forms) HEV variability. Viral variability 
could indeed modify HEV persistence in water by influencing its interaction with 
the environment, its infectivity and its pathogenicity, and subsequently its 
transmission by water. The cell culture methods used to study HEV survival still 
have drawbacks (challenging virus cultivation, time consuming, lack of 
sensitivity). As explained in the present review, the issue of HEV transmission 
to humans through water is similar to that of other enteric viruses because of 
their similar or lower survival. HEV transmission to animals through water and 
how the virus variability affects its survival and transmission remain to be 
investigated.

In this work, we report digital loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) or 
reverse-transcription LAMP (RT-LAMP) on a commercial membrane, without the need 
for complex chip fabrication or use of specialized equipment. Due to the pore 
size distribution, the theoretical error for digital LAMP on these membranes was 
analyzed, using a combination of Random Distribution Model and Multivolume 
Theory. A facile peel-off process was developed for effective droplet formation 
on the commercial track-etched polycarbonate (PCTE) membrane. Each pore 
functions as an individual nanoreactor for single DNA amplification. Absolute 
quantification of bacteria genomic DNA was realized with a dynamic range from 11 
to 1.1 × 105 copies/μL. One-step digital RT-LAMP was also successfully performed 
on the membrane for the quantification of MS2 virus in wastewater. With the 
introduction of new probes, the positive pores can be easily distinguished from 
negative ones with 100 times difference in fluorescence intensities. Finally, 
the cost of a disposable membrane is less than $0.10/piece, which, to the best 
of our knowledge, is the most inexpensive way to perform digital LAMP. The 
membrane system offers opportunities for point-of-care users or common 
laboratories to perform digital quantification, single cell analysis, or other 
bioassays in an inexpensive, flexible, and simplified way.

Natural ultraviolet irradiance disinfection is known to play a significant role 
in both natural wastewater treatment systems and drinking water disinfection 
processes, while the influence of ultraviolet B (UVB) delivering method on 
sunlight disinfection outcome is still unclear. This study aims to determine the 
effects of environmentally relevant temperatures, UVB doses (J m-2) and dose 
rates (W m-2) on the inactivation and log reduction values (LRVs) of the F-RNA 
coliphage MS2 and Escherichia coli in optically clear water. E. coli and MS2 
were separately incubated and irradiated at five different doses of UVB light 
that delivered using six UVB dose rates. The results of the study demonstrate 
that the UVB dose delivering method (combination of dose rate and exposure time) 
influences inactivation and LRVs of E. coli and MS2 at all UVB doses 
investigated (up to seven-fold difference). Two phases were identified within 
the UVB dose rate, UVB inactivation or LRV curves for both organisms; a UVB dose 
rate limited inactivation phase and a dose rate saturation inactivation phase. 
The results contribute to a better understanding of UVB disinfection in the 
environment and natural wastewater treatment systems, potentially improving the 
design and operation of high rate algal ponds.

HYPOTHESES: By selecting constituent polyelectrolytes and controlling conditions 
of their deposition, the resulting polyelectrolyte multilayers can be designed 
as surface coatings with controlled adhesive properties with respect to viruses. 
Charge and hydrophilicity of the polyelectrolyte multilayers govern virus 
adhesion.
EXPERIMENTS: Four surfaces of different charges and hydrophobicities were 
designed using a layer-by-layer assembly of poly(styrene-4-sulfonate) and 
poly(dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride). Contact angle measurements gave an 
estimate of MS2 hydrophilicity in terms of free energy of interfacial 
interaction in water. Experimental results on MS2 adhesion obtained using quartz 
crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring were compared with predictions 
by the extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (XDLVO) theory.
FINDINGS: MS2 deposition onto polyelectrolyte multilayers occurred in two 
phases: an early phase defined by virus-surface interactions and a later phase 
with virus-virus interactions controlling deposition kinetics. Principal 
component analysis showed that the deposition rates in the two phases were 
independent one of another and that each was correlated to the depth of the 
secondary minimum of the corresponding XDLVO energy profile. Hydrophobic and 
electrostatic interactions governed the deposition process: short range 
hydrophilic repulsion prevented deposition into the primary minimum while 
electrostatic interactions defined the dependence of the deposition kinetics on 
the ionic strength. Different surfaces showed distinct kinetics of and 
capacities for MS2 deposition pointing to the potential of polyelectrolyte 
multilayers as easy-to-apply coatings for regulating virus adsorption, 
inactivating viruses via the virucidal action of cationic polyelectrolytes and 
reducing human exposure to viruses.

Sunlight inactivation is important for disinfection of viruses in sunlit waters. 
As such, attempts have been made to predict the endogenous photoinactivation 
rate of bacteriophage MS2 using biological weighting functions, which describe 
microorganism sensitivity to sunlight inactivation as a function of wavelength. 
In this study, four biological weighting function models were compared to assess 
their ability to predict endogenous inactivation rates (kendo) of MS2. 
Previously-published and newly-collected datasets consisting of an incident 
irradiance spectrum (used as an input to the model) and a measured inactivation 
rate (kobs) were used for model validation and comparison. kendo values 
predicted by each model were compared with measured kobs to evaluate the ability 
of each biological weighting function to predict endogenous sunlight 
inactivation rates. A model previously developed by Mattle et al. (Env. Sci. 
Technol. 49, 334-342) over-predicted inactivation rates, whereas the other three 
models - a model from Fisher et al. (Env. Sci. Technol. 45, 9249-9255), a new 
model developed in this study, and a modification of the model by Mattle et al. 
(developed as part of this study) - were better able to estimate inactivation 
rates. The biological relevance of the spectral shape of each biological 
weighting function is discussed.

Viral illnesses have a significant direct and indirect impact on the workplace 
that burdens employers with increased healthcare costs, low productivity, and 
absenteeism. Workers' direct contact with each other and contaminated surfaces 
contributes to the spread of viruses at work. This study quantifies the impact 
of an office wellness intervention (OWI) to reduce viral load in the workplace. 
The OWI includes the use of a spray disinfectant on high-touch surfaces and 
providing workers with alcohol-based hand sanitizer gel and hand sanitizing 
wipes along with user instructions. Viral transmission was monitored by applying 
an MS2 phage tracer to a door handle and the hand of a single volunteer 
participant. At the same time, a placebo inoculum was applied to the hands of 
four additional volunteers. The purpose was to evaluate the concentration of 
viruses on workers' hands and office surfaces before and after the OWI. Results 
showed that the OWI significantly reduced viable phage concentrations per 
surface area on participants' hands, shared fomites, and personal fomites 
(p = 0.0001) with an 85.4% average reduction. Reduction of virus concentrations 
on hands and fomites is expected to subsequently minimize the risk of infections 
from common enteric and respiratory pathogens. The surfaces identified as most 
contaminated were the refrigerator, drawer handles and sink faucets in the break 
room, along with pushbar on the main exit of the building, and the soap 
dispensers in the women's restroom. A comparison of contamination in different 
locations within the office showed that the break room and women's restrooms 
were the sites with the highest tracer counts. Results of this study can be used 
to inform quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) models aimed at defining 
the relationship between surface contamination, pathogen exposure and the 
probability of disease that contributes to high healthcare costs, absenteeism, 
presenteeism, and loss of productivity in the workplace.

Bimetallic iron-copper nanoparticles (Fe/Cu-NPs) were synthesized by a 
single-pot surfactant-free method in aqueous solution [via the reduction of 
ferrous ion to zerovalent iron nanoparticles (Fe-NPs) and the subsequent 
copper-coating by metal ion exchange]. The produced Fe/Cu-NPs formed aggregates 
of spherical nanoparticles (approximately 30-70 nm) of Fe-Cu core-shell 
structures with 11 wt % copper content. The microbicidal effects of Fe/Cu-NPs 
were explored on Escherichia coli and MS2 coliphage, surrogates for bacterial 
and viral pathogens, respectively. Fe/Cu-NPs exhibited synergistically enhanced 
activity for the inactivation of E. coli and MS2, compared to single-metal 
nanoparticles (i.e., Fe-NPs and Cu-NPs). Various experiments (microbial 
inactivation tests under different conditions, fluorescence staining assays, 
experiments using ELISA and qRT-PCR, etc.) suggested that Fe/Cu-NPs inactivate 
E. coli and MS2 via dual microbicidal mechanisms. Two biocidal copper species 
[Cu(I) and Cu(III)] can be generated by different redox reactions of Fe/Cu-NPs. 
It is suggested that E. coli is strongly influenced by the cytotoxicity of 
Cu(I), while MS2 is inactivated mainly due to the oxidative damages of protein 
capsid and RNA by Cu(III).

Site-specific protein modification is a widely used strategy to attach drugs, 
imaging agents, or other useful small molecules to protein carriers. N-terminal 
modification is particularly useful as a high-yielding, site-selective 
modification strategy that can be compatible with a wide array of proteins. 
However, this modification strategy is incompatible with proteins with buried or 
sterically hindered N termini, such as virus-like particles (VLPs) composed of 
the well-studied MS2 bacteriophage coat protein. To assess VLPs with improved 
compatibility with these techniques, we generated a targeted library based on 
the MS2-derived protein cage with N-terminal proline residues followed by three 
variable positions. We subjected the library to assembly, heat, and chemical 
selections, and we identified variants that were modified in high yield with no 
reduction in thermostability. Positive charge adjacent to the native N terminus 
is surprisingly beneficial for successful extension, and over 50% of the highest 
performing variants contained positive charge at this position. Taken together, 
these studies described nonintuitive design rules governing N-terminal 
extensions and identified successful extensions with high modification 
potential.

Protective clothing manufacturers routinely test their products for resistance 
to liquid and viral penetration. Several of the test methods specified by the 
American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO) for penetration testing produce binary 
results (i.e. pass or fail), deliver imprecise pressure regulation, and do not 
record the location at which penetration events occur. Instead, our approach 
measures a continuous variable (time of penetration) during a slow and 
continuous increase of hydrostatic pressure and retains the location of 
penetration events. Using a fluorescent dye to enhance visual detection, we 
evaluate temporal and spatial patterns of penetration events. We then compare 
the time of liquid penetration with the time of penetration of two 
bacteriophages (Phi-X174 and MS2). For the fabric tested, the mean viral 
penetration occurred 0.29 minutes earlier than liquid penetration when solved by 
logistic regression. The breakthrough time of MS2 was not different from the 
Phi-X174 bacteriophage. The time of liquid penetration was a latent indicator of 
the time of viral penetration.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a waste stabilization 
pond (WSP) system to reduce pathogen contaminants in sludge. This included 
examining the factors that influence the fate and concentration of human 
pathogens and their indicators in two sludge layers. The decay rates of five 
study microorganisms were determined under in-situ conditions at a WSP. The 
background levels of fecal origin microorganisms were consistently detected 
(ranging: Escherichia coli 104 to 106, enterococci 101 to 103, F-specific 
bacteriophage (MS2) 101 to 103 and somatic coliphage 101 to 104 colony-forming 
units (CFU) mL-1, as well as 101 to 102 human adenovirus gene copies mL-1) in 
the primary facultative pond. Among microorganisms tested, the bacteria 
generally decayed faster than adenovirus and bacteriophage, particularly in the 
upper sludge layer. Due to the observed regrowth of E. coli, it may have a 
limited value as an indicator for pathogen removal in the wastewater 
stabilization ponds. The abundance of E. coli numbers within the pond biome 
followed changes in pond temperature over time. The results of the study suggest 
that viruses could survive for a long time, particularly in deeper layers 
(>1 metre) in the sludge, during winter months (T90 = 156 d). The presence of 
human pathogens in WSP sludge, in particular viruses, may be a barrier to its 
beneficial reuse in agriculture. The results indicate that additional treatment 
of sludge may be required to mitigate potential public health risks from reuse 
of sludge for agricultural purposes.

Membrane separation is proved to be a powerful tool for several applications 
such as wastewater treatment or the elimination of various microorganisms from 
drinking water. In this study, the efficiency of inorganic composite-based 
multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) hybrid membranes was investigated in the 
removal of MS2 bacteriophages from contaminated water. With this object, 
multi-walled carbon nanotubes were coated with copper(I) oxide, titanium(IV) 
oxide and iron(III) oxide nanoparticles, respectively, and their virus removal 
capability was tested in both batch and flow experiments. Considering the 
possible pH range of drinking water, the filtration tests were carried out at pH 
5.0, 7.5 and 9.0 as well. The extent of MS2 removal strongly depended on the pH 
values for each composite, which can be due to electrostatic interactions 
between the membrane and the virus. The most efficient removal (greater than or 
equal to 99.99%) was obtained with the Cu2O-coated MWCNT membrane in the whole 
pH range. The fabricated nanocomposites were characterized by X-ray diffraction, 
specific surface area measurement, dynamic light scattering, zeta potential 
measurement, Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and scanning 
electron microscopy. This study presents a simple route to design novel and 
effective nanocomposite-based hybrid membranes for virus removal.

The binding of MS2 bacteriophage coat protein (MCP) to MS2 binding site (MBS) 
RNA stem-loop sequences has been widely used to label mRNA for live-cell imaging 
at single-molecule resolution. However, concerns have been raised recently from 
studies with budding yeast showing aberrant mRNA metabolism following the 
MS2-GFP labeling. To investigate the degradation pattern of MS2-GFP-labeled mRNA 
in mammalian cells and tissues, we used Northern blot analysis of β-actin mRNA 
extracted from the Actb-MBS knock-in and MBS×MCP hybrid mouse models. In the 
immortalized mouse embryonic cell lines and various organ tissues derived from 
the mouse models, we found no noticeable accumulation of decay products of 
β-actin mRNA compared with the wild-type mice. Our results suggest that 
accumulation of MBS RNA decay fragments does not always happen depending on the 
mRNA species and the model organisms used.

Ultraviolet light-emitting diode (UV-LED) is an emerging UV source with many 
special features due to the nature of semiconductor devices. One such feature is 
wavelength diversity that does not exist in conventional mercury based UV lamps, 
which provides opportunities to selectively combine multiple wavelengths for 
potentially additional effects by UV-LEDs. In this work, the inactivation of 
different microorganisms in water was investigated by UV-LEDs wavelength 
combinations. Various wavelength combinations, including simultaneous and 
sequential exposures, in different UV ranges such as UVC, UVB and UVA, were 
examined. These combinations were applied to the inactivation of indicator 
bacterium E. coli and coliphage MS2 in water. The results showed the effect of 
UV-LEDs multiple wavelengths depends on which wavelengths (UVC, UVB and UVA) are 
combined and the manner that different wavelengths (simultaneous, sequential) 
are used. Also, different microorganisms (bacteria, virus) respond differently 
to wavelength combinations. Combinations of UVC/UVB always achieved additive 
effect on microorganisms inactivation due to the same photochemical reaction 
induced by UVC/UVB on DNA. Combining UVA with UVC/UVB simultaneously or applying 
UVA after UVC/UVB reduced the inactivation of bacterium E. coli due to DNA 
repair and photoreactivation effect of UVA. However, applying extended UVA 
exposure before UVC significantly improved E. coli inactivation. For virus MS2 
inactivation, only additive effect was observed under various wavelength 
combinations. This study presented a comprehensive work on UV-LEDs wavelength 
combinations, which is of significance on the application of UV-LEDs for water 
disinfection.

Microorganism removal efficiencies in deep bed filters vary with time and depth 
in the filter bed as the filter collects particles. Improved knowledge of such 
dynamics is relevant for the design, operation and microbial risk assessment of 
filtration processes for drinking water treatment. Here we report on a 
high-resolution spatio-temporal characterization of virus and bacteria removal 
in a pilot-scale dual-media filter, operated in contact-filtration mode. 
Microorganisms investigated were bacteriophage Salmonella typhimurium 28B 
(plaque assay, n=154)), fRNA phage MS2 (plaque assay/RT-qPCR, n=87) and E. coli 
(Colilert-18, n=73). Microscopic and macroscopic filtration models were used to 
investigate and characterize the removal dynamics. Results show that 
ripening/breakthrough fronts for turbidity, viruses and E. coli migrated in a 
wave-like manner across the depth of the filter. Virus removal improved 
continuously throughout the filter cycle and viruses broke through almost 
simultaneously with turbidity. Ripening for E. coli took longer than ripening 
for turbidity, but the bacteria broke through before turbidity breakthrough. 
Instantaneous log-removal peaked at 3.2, 3.0 and 4.5 for 28B, MS2 and E. coli, 
respectively. However, true average log-removal during the period of stable 
effluent turbidity was significantly lower at 2.5, 2.3 and 3.6, respectively. 
Peak observed filter coefficients λ were higher than predicted by ideal 
filtration theory. This study demonstrates the importance of carefully designed 
sampling regimes when characterizing microorganism removal efficiencies of deep 
bed filters.

mass spectrometry.

RATIONALE: Cell-free transcription-translation (TXTL) is becoming a popular 
technology to prototype and engineer biological systems outside living 
organisms. TXTL relies commonly on a cytoplasmic extract that provides the 
molecular components necessary to recapitulate gene expression in vitro, where 
most of the available systems are derived from E. coli. The proteinic and 
enzymatic composition of lysates, however, is typically unknown. In this work, 
we analyzed by mass spectrometry the molecular constituents of the all-E. coli 
TXTL platform myTXTL prepared from the E. coli strain BL21 Rosetta2.
METHODS: Standard TXTL reactions were assembled and executed for 10-12 hours at 
29°C. In addition to a no-DNA control, four DNA programs were executed in 
separate reactions to synthesize the reporter protein deGFP as well as the 
phages MS2, phix174 and T7. The reactions were treated according to standard 
procedures (trypsin treatment, cleaning) before performing liquid 
chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Data analysis was performed using 
Sequest and protein identification using Scaffold.
RESULTS: A total of 500-800 proteins were identified by LC/MS in the blank 
reactions. We organized the most abundant protein sets into several categories 
pertaining, in particular, to transcription, translation and ATP regeneration. 
The synthesis of deGFP was easily measured. The major structural proteins that 
compose the three phages MS2, phix174 and T7 were also identified.
CONCLUSIONS: Mass spectrometry is a practical tool to characterize biochemical 
solutions as complex as a cell-free TXTL reaction and to determine the presence 
of synthesized proteins. The data presented demonstrate that the composition of 
TXTL based on lysates can be used to validate some underlying molecular 
mechanisms implicated in cell-free protein synthesis. The composition of the 
lysate shows significant differences with respect to similar studies on other E. 
coli strains.

As self-assembling polyvalent nanoscale structures that can tolerate substantial 
genetic and chemical modification, virus-like particles are useful in a variety 
of fields. Here we describe the genetic modification and structural 
characterization of the Leviviridae PP7 capsid protein as a platform for the 
presentation of functional polypeptides. This particle was shown to tolerate the 
display of sequences from 1 kDa (a cell penetrating peptide) to 14 kDa (the 
Fc-binding double Z-domain) on its exterior surface as C-terminal genetic 
fusions to the coat protein. In addition, a dimeric construct allowed the 
presentation of exogenous loops between capsid monomers and the simultaneous 
presentation of two different peptides at different positions on the icosahedral 
structure. The PP7 particle is thereby significantly more tolerant of these 
types of polypeptide additions than Qβ and MS2, the other Leviviridae-derived 
VLPs in common use.

Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the most common sexually transmitted 
infections. HPVs are transmitted through anogenital sex or oral sex. Anogenital 
transmission/infection is associated with anogenital cancers and genital warts 
while oral transmission/infection is associated with head and neck cancers 
(HNCs) including recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Current HPV vaccines 
protect against HPV types associated with ∼90% of cervical cancers and are 
expected to protect against a percentage of HNCs. However, only a few studies 
have assessed the efficacy of current vaccines against oral HPV infections. We 
had previously developed a mixed MS2-L2 candidate HPV vaccine based on 
bacteriophage MS2 virus-like particles (VLPs). The mixed MS2-L2 VLPs consisted 
of a mixture of two MS2-L2 VLPs displaying: i) a concatemer of L2 peptide 
(epitope 20-31) from HPV31 & L2 peptide (epitope 17-31) from HPV16 and ii) a 
consensus L2 peptide representing epitope 69-86. The mixed MS2-L2 VLPs 
neutralized/protected mice against six HPV types associated with ∼87% of 
cervical cancer. Here, we show that the mixed MS2-L2 VLPs can protect mice 
against additional HPV types; at the genital region, the VLPs protect against 
HPV53, 56, 11 and at the oral region, the VLPs protect against HPV16, 35, 39, 
52, and 58. Thus, mixed MS2-L2 VLPs protect against eleven oncogenic HPV types 
associated with ∼95% of cervical cancer. The VLPs also have the potential to 
protect, orally, against the same oncogenic HPVs, associated with ∼99% of HNCs, 
including HPV11, which is associated with up to 32% of recurrent respiratory 
papillomatosis. Moreover, mixed MS2-L2 VLPs are thermostable at room temperature 
for up to 60 days after spray-freeze drying and they are protective against oral 
HPV infection.

PURPOSE: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a common lifelong sexually transmitted 
infection. HSV-1 typically manifests as oral cold sores, while HSV-2 is more 
traditionally associated with sexual transmission and infection. We have 
developed a real-time PCR (Trioplex) for the simultaneous detection of HSV-1 and 
-2 and the bacterial phage internal control (IC) MS2.
METHODOLOGY: To determine the performance of the Trioplex method and resolve 
discrepancies, 178 clinical specimens from cutaneous and mucocutaneous sources 
were tested using 3 different methods; virus culture with direct fluorescent 
antibody (DFA) immunostaining, Trioplex and a commercially available HSV 
analyte-specific reagent (ASR).
RESULTS: HSV Trioplex was significantly more sensitive than virus culture (89 
and 67 % HSV 1/2, respectively) and comparable to the commercial assay 
(P<0.001). Cost analysis revealed that the Trioplex reduced cost by 80  % 
compared to cell culture.
CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of the HSV Trioplex improved the detection 
turnaround time from 3-10 days to 2.5 h, thus streamlining Herpes detection, 
improving sensitivity and reducing laboratory costs.

RNA-protein interactions play important roles in various eukaryotic biological 
processes. Molecular imaging of subcellular localization of RNA-protein 
complexes in plants is critical for understanding these interactions. However, 
methods to image RNA-protein interactions in living plants have not yet been 
developed until now. Recently, we have developed a trimolecular fluorescence 
complementation (TriFC) system for in vivo visualization of RNA-protein 
interaction by transient expression in tobacco leaves. In this method, we 
combined conventional bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) system 
with the MS2 system (phage MS2 coat protein [MCP] and its binding RNA sequence 
[MS2 sequence]) to tag lncRNA. Target RNA is tagged with 6xMS2, and MCP and 
RNA-binding protein are fused with YFP fragments. DNA constructs encoding such 
fusion RNA and proteins are infiltrated into tobacco leaves with Agrobacterium 
suspensions. RNA-protein interaction in vivo is observed by confocal microscopy.

Ultrafiltration concentration of microorganisms in large volume water samples 
containing high levels of particulate matter was evaluated in a proof of concept 
study. The organisms tested were Bacillus atrophaeus subspecies globigii spores 
and MS2 bacteriophage. To produce the large volume samples, fresh water sediment 
of a known particle size was added to 51 l of tap water. Five different 
concentrations of particulate matter were studied: 0, 50, 100, 150 and 750 mg 
solids/l. The concentration procedure used a dialysis filter as the ultrafilter 
configured for axial flow, either with or without recirculation. The target 
number of organisms spiked was 1 × 105 of either spores or bacteriophage per 
51 l. After concentration, the filters were dissected to retrieve the fibers 
which were then washed using surfactant solution which was then analyzed for the 
target organisms. Two washes of the filter fibers were carried out sequentially. 
For axial flow with recirculation, the first wash produced statistically greater 
recovery of B. globigii spores (26-40% of spike) compared to the second wash 
(8-13% of spike). Total recovery (the sum of the recoveries for the first and 
second washes) ranged from 35 to 53%. Recovery increased as the solids level 
increased from 0 to 150 mg solids/l. Recovery at the 100 and 150 mg solids/L 
loadings was statistically higher at the P < .05 level than recovery at 0 mg/L 
solids. At 150 mg solids/L, axial flow without recirculation (dead end) yielded 
lower recovery than axial flow with recirculation, however the difference was 
not significant at the P < .05 level. Recovery of B. globigii at 750 mg solids/L 
averaged 38% using dead end axial flow. The average recovery of MS2 
bacteriophage was 45% at a solids concentration of 150 mg/L using axial flow 
with recirculation. PhiX174 and Phi8 were also studied, however these 
bacteriophage appeared to be inactivated in the matrix of concentrated wash 
water. One hundred liters of water containing 750 mg solids/L was concentrated 
using dead end axial flow, and only minimal problems with filter clogging were 
observed. Results described herein suggest axial flow ultrafiltration is an 
effective concentration method for microorganisms in water containing high 
levels of particulate matter.

Fate and transport of carbon nanomaterials can be strongly dependent on the 
interaction with secondary particulates in the aquatic systems. Bio-particulates 
in water, e.g., viruses with charged and hydrophobic surface moieties, may 
profoundly influence the interfacial behavior and hence the environmental fate 
of nanomaterials (and vice versa). This study systematically evaluates the 
interfacial interaction of acid-functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes 
(MWNTs) with MS2 bacteriophages, or heteroaggregation behavior of these 
particulates, under mono- and di-valent cations and with Suwannee River humic 
acid (SRHA). Results indicate that the highest concentration of MS2 (i.e., 
MWNT:MS2 of 100:1) renders exceptional stability of MWNTs, even in high salinity 
conditions. However, at lower MS2 concentrations (i.e., MWNT:MS2 of 1000:1 and 
10,000:1), the suppression of MWNT heteroaggregation rate is not as significant. 
The observed enhanced stability is likely caused by the preferential attachment 
of the MS2 capsids onto MWNT surfaces, which is mediated by electrostatic 
attraction (between negatively charged oxygen-containing moieties on MWNTs and 
positively charged amino acid residues on MS2 surfaces) and/or by MS2 capsids 
with positive hydropathy index (indicating strong hydrophobicity). Presence of 
SRHA also shows stability enhancement; however, at lower MS2 concentrations, 
SRHA dominated the heteroaggregation behavior. These results implicate that 
preferential interaction between virus capsids (i.e., MS2 and may be other 
waterborne viruses) and carbonaceous nanomaterials may influence environmental 
transport of both in aquatic environments.

The comparative accumulation and depuration processes for several microorganisms 
( Escherichia coli , Salmonella typhimurium , Vibrio parahaemolyticus , 
Aeromonas hydrophila , Streptococcus faecalis , Staphylococcus aureus , and MS-2 
coliphage) by the striped venus, Chamelea gallina , under controlled laboratory 
conditions were studied. Microorganisms accumulated rapidly in bivalves during 
the first 6 h, with accumulation rates between 3.2 to 360.5 organisms/h 
depending on the type of microorganism. The relative patterns and rates of 
elimination of the microorganisms suggest that they are eliminated from 
shellfish in two different ways. One is of a mechanical nature that results in 
microbial elimination during the first 12 h. The other elimination mechanism 
depends upon the microbial species and their accumulated number. All 
microorganisms tested were eliminated completely by the molluscs after 3 d of 
depuration, except MS-2 bacteriophages. Results indicate that MS-2 coliphages 
may be a more reliable indicator of the microbial depuration efficiency by the 
shellfish under laboratory conditions than E. coli .

Nanoparticles (NPs) are used in numerous applications and have been observed to 
accumulate in natural water bodies, including aquifers where they can interact 
with suspended colloids and viruses. This study examines the attachment of 
bacteriophage MS2 onto titanium dioxide (TiO2) anatase NPs using three different 
MS2 concentrations. Batch experiments, were conducted at room temperature to 
investigate the effect of ambient light and the presence of quartz sand on MS2 
and TiO2 NPs heteroaggregation. Appropriate attachment isotherms were 
determined. Extended DLVO (XDLVO) theory was used to quantify the various 
interaction energy profiles. The results of batch experiments demonstrated that 
MS2 attachment onto TiO2 NPs was favored in the presence of sand under ambient 
light, while under dark conditions no clear trend was observed. Estimated XDLVO 
interaction energy profiles indicated that hydrophobic interactions may play a 
major role and influence the aggregation and heteroaggregation of MS2 and TiO2 
NPs, as well as the simultaneous attachment of MS2 and TiO2 NPs onto quartz 
sand.

This study investigated the effect of ultraviolet-C irradiation on the 
inactivation of microorganisms in coconut water, a highly opaque liquid food 
(1.01 ± 0.018 absorption coefficient). Ultraviolet-C inactivation kinetics of 
two bacteriophages (MS2, T1UV) and three surrogate bacteria (Escherichia coli, 
Salmonella Typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes) in 0.1% (w/v) peptone and 
coconut water were investigated. Ultraviolet-C irradiation at 254 nm was applied 
to stirred samples, using a collimated beam device. A series of known 
ultraviolet-C doses (0-40 mJ cm-2) were applied for ultraviolet-C treatment 
except for MS2 where higher doses were delivered (100 mJ cm-2). Inactivation 
levels of all organisms were proportional to ultraviolet-C dose. At the highest 
dose of 40 mJ cm-2, three surrogates of pathogenic bacteria were inactivated by 
more than 5-log10 (p < 0.05) in 0.1% (w/v) peptone and coconut water. Results 
showed that ultraviolet-C irradiation effectively inactivated bacteriophage and 
surrogate bacteria in highly opaque coconut water. The log reduction kinetics of 
microorganisms followed log-linear and exponential models with higher R2 (>0.95) 
and low root mean square error values. The D10 values of 3, 5.48, and 
4.58 mJ cm-2 were obtained from the inactivation of E. coli, S. Typhimurium, and 
L. monocytogenes, respectively. Models for predicting log reduction as a 
function of ultraviolet-C irradiation dose were found to be significant 
(p < 0.05). Fluid optics were the key controlling parameters for efficient 
microbial inactivation. Therefore, the ultraviolet-C dose must be calculated not 
only from the incident ultraviolet-C intensity but must also consider the 
attenuation in the samples. The results from this study imply that adequate log 
reduction of vegetative cells and model viruses is achievable in coconut water 
and suggested significant potential for ultraviolet-C treatment of other liquid 
foods.

Lassa fever is a severe viral hemorrhagic illness caused by Lassa virus. Based 
on estimates, the number of LASV infections ranges from 300,000 to 500,000 cases 
in endemic areas with a fatality rate of 1%. Development of fast and sensitive 
tools for the control and prevention of Lassa virus infection as well as for 
clinical diagnostics of Lassa fever are crucial. Here we reported development 
and evaluation of a one-step quantitative RT-qPCR assay for the Lassa virus 
detection - LASV-Fl. This assay is suitable for the detection of lineages I-IV 
of Lassa virus. The limit of detection of the assay ranged from 103 copies/ml to 
105 copies/ml and has 96.4% diagnostic sensitivity, whereas analytical and 
diagnostic specificities both were 100%. Serum, whole blood and tissue are 
suitable for use with the assay. The assay contains all the necessary components 
to perform the analysis, including an armored positive control (ARC+) and an 
armored internal control (IC). The study was done during the mission of 
specialized anti-epidemic team of the Russian Federation (SAET) in the Republic 
of Guinea in 2015-2018. Based on sequencing data, LASV-specific assay was 
developed using synthetic MS2-phage-based armored RNA particles, RNA from Lassa 
virus strain Josiah, and further, evaluated in field conditions using samples 
from patients and Mastomys natalensis rodents.

Electrochemical water treatment is a promising alternative for small-scale and 
remote water systems that lack operational capacity or convenient access to 
reagents for chemical coagulation and disinfection. In this study, the 
mitigation of viruses was investigated using electrocoagulation as a 
pretreatment prior to electrooxidation treatment using boron-doped diamond 
electrodes. This research is the first to investigate a sequential 
electrocoagulation-electrooxidation treatment system for virus removal. 
Bench-scale, batch reactors were used to evaluate mitigation of viruses in 
variable water quality via: a) electrooxidation, and b) a sequential 
electrocoagulation-electrooxidation treatment train. Electrooxidation of two 
bacteriophages, MS2 and ΦX174, was inhibited by natural organic matter and 
turbidity, indicating the probable need for pretreatment. However, the 
electrocoagulation-electrooxidation treatment train was beneficial only in the 
model surface waters employed. In model groundwaters, electrocoagulation alone 
was as good or better than the combined electrocoagulation-electrooxidation 
treatment train. Reduction of human echovirus was significantly lower than one 
or both bacteriophages in all model waters, though bacteriophage ΦX174 was a 
more representative surrogate than MS2 in the presence of natural organic matter 
and turbidity. Compared to conventional treatment by ferric salt coagulant 
and free chlorine disinfection, the electrocoagulation-electrooxidation system 
was less effective in model surface waters but more effective in model 
groundwaters. Sequential electrocoagulation-electrooxidation was beneficial for 
some applications, though practical considerations may currently outweigh the 
benefits.

Solar water disinfection (SODIS) is an appropriate technology for household 
treatment of drinking water in low-to-middle-income communities, as it is 
effective, low cost and easy to use. Nevertheless, uptake is low due partially 
to the burden of using small volume polyethylene terephthalate bottles (1.5-2 
L). A major challenge is to develop a low-cost transparent container for 
disinfecting larger volumes of water. (2) Methods: This study examines the 
capability of transparent polypropylene (PP) buckets of 5 L- and 20 L- volume as 
SODIS containers using three waterborne pathogen indicators: Escherichia coli, 
MS2-phage and Cryptosporidium parvum. (3) Results: Similar inactivation kinetics 
were observed under natural sunlight for the inactivation of all three organisms 
in well water using 5 L- and 20 L-buckets compared to 1.5 
L-polyethylene-terephthalate (PET) bottles. The PP materials were exposed to 
natural and accelerated solar ageing (ISO-16474). UV transmission of the 20 
L-buckets remained stable and with physical integrity even after the longest 
ageing periods (9 months or 900 h of natural or artificial solar UV exposure, 
respectively). The 5 L-buckets were physically degraded and lost significant 
UV-transmission, due to the thinner wall compared to the 20 L-bucket. (4) 
Conclusion: This work demonstrates that the 20 L SODIS bucket technology 
produces excellent bacterial, viral and protozoan inactivation and is obtained 
using a simple transparent polypropylene bucket fabricated locally at very low 
cost ($2.90 USD per unit). The increased bucket volume of 20 L allows for a 
ten-fold increase in treatment batch volume and can thus more easily provide for 
the drinking water requirements of most households. The use of buckets in 
households across low to middle income countries is an already accepted 
practice.

Automated Design of Diverse Stand-Alone Riboswitches.

Wu MJ, Andreasson JOL, Kladwang W, Greenleaf W, Das R.

Riboswitches that couple binding of ligands to conformational changes offer 
sensors and control elements for RNA synthetic biology and medical 
biotechnology. However, design of these riboswitches has required expert 
intuition or software specialized to transcription or translation outputs; 
design has been particularly challenging for applications in which the 
riboswitch output cannot be amplified by other molecular machinery. We present a 
fully automated design method called RiboLogic for such "stand-alone" 
riboswitches and test it via high-throughput experiments on 2875 molecules using 
RNA-MaP (RNA on a massively parallel array) technology. These molecules 
consistently modulate their affinity to the MS2 bacteriophage coat protein upon 
binding of flavin mononucleotide, tryptophan, theophylline, and microRNA 
miR-208a, achieving activation ratios of up to 20 and significantly better 
performance than control designs. By encompassing a wide diversity of 
stand-alone switches and highly quantitative data, the resulting 
ribologic-solves experimental data set provides a rich resource for further 
improvement of riboswitch models and design methods.

Single-stranded RNA bacteriophages (ssRNA phages) infect Gram-negative bacteria 
via a single maturation protein (Mat), which attaches to a retractile pilus of 
the host. Here we present structures of the ssRNA phage MS2 in complex with the 
Escherichia coli F-pilus, showing a network of hydrophobic and electrostatic 
interactions at the Mat-pilus interface. Moreover, binding of the pilus induces 
slight orientational variations of the Mat relative to the rest of the phage 
capsid, priming the Mat-connected genomic RNA (gRNA) for its release from the 
virions. The exposed tip of the attached Mat points opposite to the direction of 
the pilus retraction, which may facilitate the translocation of the gRNA from 
the capsid into the host cytosol. In addition, our structures determine the 
orientation of the assembled F-pilin subunits relative to the cell envelope, 
providing insights into the F-like type IV secretion systems.

Recently, ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (UV-LEDs) have emerged as a new UV 
source, bringing flexibility for various UV wavelength combinations due to their 
unique feature of wavelength diversity. In this study, we investigated 
inactivation mechanisms of representative microorganisms at different wavelength 
combinations using UV-LEDs. Two types of indicator microorganisms were examined, 
namely Escherichia coli (E. coli) as a representative bacteria and bacteriophage 
MS2 as a representative virus. Different inactivation effects were observed, and 
the results for UVA pretreatment followed by UVC inactivation were particularly 
interesting. While a substantial shoulder in the E. coli UVC inactivation curve 
was observed, this was reduced by UVA pretreatment (365 nm) at 17 J/cm2. 
Further, 52 J/cm2 UVA eliminated the shoulder in the fluence-response curves, 
resulting in improved UVC (265 nm) inactivation of E. coli by over two orders of 
magnitude. No inactivation improvement was observed for MS2. Moreover, UVA 
pretreatment eliminated photoreactivation of E. coli but did not affect dark 
repair. Detailed investigation of inactivation mechanisms revealed that hydroxyl 
radicals (•OH) played a significant role in the effects of UVA pretreatment. 
This study demonstrated that •OH radicals were generated inside E. coli cells 
during UVA pretreatment, which accounted for the subsequent effects on E. coli. 
The impact of UVA pretreatment on E. coli inactivation and reactivation was 
mainly due to increased levels of •OH radicals in E. coli cells, impairing cell 
functions such as DNA self-repair.

Emerging water treatment technologies using ferrous and zero-valent iron show 
promising virus mitigation by both inactivation and adsorption. In this study, 
iron electrocoagulation was investigated for virus mitigation in drinking water 
via bench-scale batch experiments. Relative contributions of physical removal 
and inactivation, as determined by recovery via pH 9.5 beef broth elution, were 
investigated for three mammalian viruses (adenovirus, echovirus, and feline 
calicivirus) and four bacteriophage surrogates (fr, MS2, P22, and ΦX174). Though 
no one bacteriophage exactly represented mitigation of the mammalian viruses in 
all water matrices, bacteriophage ΦX174 was the only surrogate that showed 
overall removal comparable to that of the mammalian viruses. Bacteriophages fr, 
MS2, and P22 were all more susceptible to inactivation than the three mammalian 
viruses, raising concerns about the suitability of these common surrogates as 
indicators of virus mitigation. To determine why some bacteriophages were 
particularly susceptible to inactivation, mechanisms of bacteriophage mitigation 
due to electrocoagulation were investigated. Physical removal was primarily due 
to inclusion in flocs, while inactivation was primarily due to ferrous iron 
oxidation. Greater electrostatic attraction, virus aggregation, and capsid 
durability were proposed as reasons for virus susceptibility to ferrous-based 
inactivation. Results suggest that overall treatment claims based on 
bacteriophage mitigation for any iron-based technology should be critically 
considered due to higher susceptibility of bacteriophages to inactivation via 
ferrous oxidation.

Microbial contamination of vegetables due to irrigation with wastewater-polluted 
streams is a common problem around most cities in developing countries because 
wastewater is an available source of water and nutrients but wastewater 
treatment is often inadequate. On-farm treatment of polluted water is a feasible 
option to manage microbial risks in a multi-barrier approach. Current evidence 
indicates good suitability of biochar filters for microbe removal from 
wastewater using the hydraulic loading rate (HLR) designed for sand filters, but 
their suitability has not been tested under on-farm conditions. This study 
evaluated the combined effect of several variables on removal of microbial 
indicators from diluted wastewater by biochar filtration on-farm and the 
correlations between removal efficiency and HLR. Columns of biochar with three 
different effective particle diameters (d10) were fed with diluted wastewater at 
1x, 6x, and 12x the design HLR and two levels of water salinity (electrical 
conductivity, EC). Influent and effluent samples were collected from the columns 
and analyzed for bacteriophages (ɸX174 and MS2), Escherichia coli, Enterococcus 
spp., and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Microbe removal decreased with increasing 
HLR, from 2 to 4 to 1 log10 for bacteria and from 2 to 0.8 log10 for viruses, 
while S. cerevisiae removal was unaffected. Effective particle diameter (d10) 
was the main variable explaining microbe removal at 6x and 12x, while EC had no 
effect. Correlation analysis showed removal of 2 log10 bacteria and 1 log10 
virus at 3x HLR. Thus biochar filters on-farm would not remove significant 
amounts of bacteria and viruses. However, the design HLR was found to be 
conservative. These results, and some technical and management considerations 
identified, can assist in the development of a scientific method for designing 
biochar filters for on-farm and conventional wastewater treatment.

AIMS: (i) To develop an analytical method for recovery and quantification of 
bacteriophage MS2-as a surrogate for foot-and-mouth disease virus-from complex 
porous surfaces, with and without the presence of laboratory-developed 
agricultural grime; (ii) to evaluate, with a 4-log dynamic range, the virucidal 
activity of common biocides for their ability to decontaminate surfaces and 
hence remediate facilities, following a foreign animal disease contamination 
incident.
METHODS AND RESULTS: An analytical method was developed and optimized for MS2 
recovery from simulated agricultural surfaces. The addition of Dey-Engley 
neutralizing broth to an extraction buffer improved MS2 viability in liquid 
extracts, with optimal analytical holding times determined as <8 to ≤24 h, 
depending on matrix. The recovery of MS2 from surface materials decreased in the 
order: nonporous reference material >grimed porous materials >nongrimed porous 
materials. In disinfectant testing, two spray applications of pAB were effective 
against MS2 (≥4-log reduction) on all operational-scale materials. Two per cent 
citric acid had limited effectiveness, with a ≥4-log reduction observed on a 
selected subset of grimed concrete samples.
CONCLUSIONS: Decontamination efficacy test results can be affected by surface 
characteristics, extraction buffer composition, analytical holding time and 
surface-specific organism survivability. Efficacy should be evaluated using a 
test method that reflects the environmental characteristics of the intended 
application.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results of this study demonstrate the 
importance of analytical method verification tests for disinfectant testing 
prior to application in complex environments.

Visualization of single mRNAs in their native cellular environment provides key 
information to study gene expression regulation. This fundamental biological 
question triggered the development of the MS2-MCP (MS2-Capsid Protein) system to 
tag mRNAs and image their life cycle using widefield fluorescence microscopy. 
The last two decades have evolved toward improving the qualitative and 
quantitative characteristics of the MS2-MCP system. Here, we provide a protocol 
to use the latest versions, MS2V6 and MS2V7, to tag and visualize mRNAs in 
mammalian cells in culture. The motivation behind engineering MS2V6 and MS2V7 
was to overcome a degradation caveat observed in S. cerevisiae with the previous 
MS2-MCP systems. While for yeast we recommend the use of MS2V6, we found that 
for live-cell imaging experiments in mammalian cells, the MS2V7 has improved 
reporter properties.

The self-assembly of viral capsids is an essential step to the formation of 
infectious viruses. Elucidating the kinetic mechanisms of how a capsid or 
virus-like particle assembles could advance our knowledge about the viral 
lifecycle, as well as the general principles in self-assembly of biomaterials. 
However, current understanding of capsid assembly remains incomplete for many 
viruses due to the fact that the transient intermediates along the assembling 
pathways are experimentally difficult to be detected. In this paper, we 
constructed a new multiscale computational framework to simulate the 
self-assembly of virus-like particles. We applied our method to the coat 
proteins of bacteriophage MS2 as a specific model system. This virus-like 
particle of bacteriophage MS2 has a unique feature that its 90 
sequence-identical dimers can be classified into two structurally various 
groups: one is the symmetric CC dimer, and the other is the asymmetric AB dimer. 
The homotypic interactions between AB dimers result in a 5-fold symmetric 
contact, while the heterotypic interactions between AB and CC dimers result in 
6-fold symmetric contact. We found that the assembly can be described as a 
physical process of phase transition that is regulated by various factors such 
as concentration and specific stoichiometry between AB and CC dimers. Our 
simulations also demonstrate that heterotypic and homotypic interfaces play 
distinctive roles in modulating the assembling kinetics. The interaction between 
AB and CC dimers is much more dynamic than that between two AB dimers. We 
therefore suggest that the alternate growth of viral capsid through the 
heterotypic dimer interactions dominates the assembling pathways. This is, to 
the best of our knowledge, the first multiscale model to simulate the assembling 
process of coat proteins in bacteriophage MS2. The generality of this approach 
opens the door to its further applications in assembly of other viral capsids, 
virus-like particles, and novel drug delivery systems.

Bacteriophage MS2 was employed for targeted delivery of an apoptosis-inducing 
agent, Tl+, into a tumor tissue. The targeted delivery was ensured by iRGD 
peptide, a ligand of integrins presumably located on the surface of 
endotheliocytes of the tumor tissue neovasculature and certain tumor cells. The 
synthesized peptide was conjugated to MS2 capsid proteins. Tl+ ions from TlNO3 
penetrated the phage particles and tightly bound to phage RNA. Peptide-modified 
MS2 preparations filled with Tl+ caused cell death in two types of cultivated 
human breast cancer cells and effected necrosis of these tumor xenografts in 
mice. Neither peptide-conjugated bacteriophage MS2 without Tl+ nor the phage 
filled with Tl+ but without the peptide or the same phage with the 
non-conjugated peptide in solution produced such effects. The preparation 
exhibited no acute toxicity at a therapeutic dose.

Foodborne viruses are a global threat to food safety. Real-time reverse 
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most commonly used 
method to detect viral RNA in food. Armored RNA (AR) prepared using the MS2 
phage system is a successful positive control for detecting foodborne viruses 
and is an important quality control process when using real-time RT-PCR. In this 
study, we report a novel technology for preparing AR using bacteriophage Qβ and 
compare its stability with AR prepared using the MS2 phage system for packaging 
norovirus detection target RNA. AR could be successfully and efficiently 
produced using the developed bacteriophage Qβ system. Two types of AR-AR-QNoV 
prepared using the Qβ system and AR-MNoV prepared using the MS2 system-were 
stored at different temperatures for different durations. After incubating at 
- 20 °C for 360 days, the copy numbers of AR-QNoV and AR-MNoV decreased by 8.9% 
and 35.9%, respectively. After incubating at 4 °C for 60 days, the copy numbers 
of AR-QNoV and AR-MNoV decreased by 12.0% and 38.9%, respectively. After 
incubating at 45 °C, the copy numbers of AR-QNoV decreased by 71.8% after 
5 days, whereas those of AR-MNoV decreased by 92.9% after only 4 days. After 
5 days, AR-MNoV could not be detected using real-time RT-PCR. There was a 
significant difference in copy numbers decrease rate between AR-QNoV and AR-MNoV 
at three different temperatures (P < 0.05 ). Therefore, AR prepared using the 
new bacteriophage Qβ system is more stable than the traditional AR, making the 
developed strategy a good candidate for AR preparation and quality control.

Surface water contaminated with algae and with enteric viruses is a global 
problem. When surface water is used as a drinking water source, it is important 
to know the influence of algal organic matter on the disinfection of viruses. In 
this work, we studied the disinfection efficacy of ferrate and the influence of 
algal organic matter on the disinfection. We determined the MS2 inactivation 
kinetics by ferrate under three pH conditions (7, 8, and 8.7). The experimental 
results and pH-dependent calculation suggest that H2FeO4 and HFeO4- are 1935 and 
8 times as effective as FeO42- in MS2 inactivation. We also found that 
intracellular algal organic matter (IAOM) had a stronger effect on MS2 
inactivation kinetics than extracellular algal organic matter (EAOM) suggesting 
that IAOM led to higher consumption of Fe(VI) compared to EAOM. At pH 8.7, while 
significant consumption of FeO42- by as low as 8 mg C/L of EAOM and 2 mg C/L of 
IAOM was detected, MS2 inactivation was negatively influenced only when 
13 mg C/L of IAOM present. This study showed that it is important to control pH 
and to determine the concentration of algal organic matter if ferrate is used 
for disinfection of surface water contaminated with algae.

RNA replicases catalyse transcription and replication of viral RNA genomes. Of 
particular interest for in vitro studies are phage replicases due to their small 
number of host factors required for activity and their ability to initiate 
replication in the absence of any primers. However, the requirements for 
template recognition by most phage replicases are still only poorly understood. 
Here, we show that the active replicase of the archetypical RNA phage MS2 can be 
produced in a recombinant cell-free expression system. We find that the 3' 
terminal fusion of antisense RNAs with a domain derived from the reverse 
complement of the wild type MS2 genome generates efficient templates for 
transcription by the MS2 replicase. The new system enables DNA-independent gene 
expression both in batch reactions and in microcompartments. Finally, we 
demonstrate that MS2-based RNA-dependent transcription-translation reactions can 
be used to control DNA-dependent gene expression by encoding a viral 
DNA-dependent RNA polymerase on a MS2 RNA template. Our study sheds light on the 
template requirements of the MS2 replicase and paves the way for new in vitro 
applications including the design of genetic circuits combining both DNA- and 
RNA-encoded systems.

Self-assembly is widely used by biological systems to build functional 
nanostructures, such as the protein capsids of RNA viruses. But because assembly 
is a collective phenomenon involving many weakly interacting subunits and a 
broad range of timescales, measurements of the assembly pathways have been 
elusive. We use interferometric scattering microscopy to measure the assembly 
kinetics of individual MS2 bacteriophage capsids around MS2 RNA. By recording 
how many coat proteins bind to each of many individual RNA strands, we find that 
assembly proceeds by nucleation followed by monotonic growth. Our measurements 
reveal the assembly pathways in quantitative detail and also show their failure 
modes. We use these results to critically examine models of the assembly 
process.

Viral contamination of drinking water due to fecal contamination is difficult to 
detect and treat effectively, leading to frequent outbreaks worldwide. The 
purpose of this paper is to report on the molecular mechanism for unprecedented 
high virus removal from a practical sand filter. Sand filters functionalized 
using a water extract of Moringa oleifera (MO) seeds, functionalized sand 
(f-sand) filters, achieved a ∼7 log10 virus removal. These tests were conducted 
with MS2 bacteriophage, a recognized surrogate for pathogenic norovirus and 
rotavirus. We studied the molecular mechanism of this high removal since it can 
have important implications for sand filtration, the most common water treatment 
technology worldwide. Our data reveal that the virus removal activity of f-sand 
is due to the presence of a chitin-binding protein, M. oleifera chitin-binding 
protein (MoCBP) on f-sand. Standard column experiments were supported by 
proteomic analysis and molecular docking simulations. Our simulations show that 
MoCBP binds preferentially to MS2 capsid proteins demonstrating that specific 
molecular interactions are responsible for enhanced virus removal. In addition, 
we simplified the process of making f-sand and evinced how it could be 
regenerated using saline water. At present, no definitive solution exists for 
the challenge of treating fecally contaminated drinking and irrigation water for 
viruses without using technologies that demand high energy or chemical 
consumption. We propose functionalized sand (f-sand) filters as a highly 
effective, energy-efficient, and practical technology for virus removal 
applicable to both developing and developed countries.

Although metal contact is known to reduce bacterial growth, the effects of 
physical barriers and electricity need further investigation. This study 
examined the bacteria-reducing properties of copper and stainless-steel metal 
plates with an added electrical current and up to three filter layers on the 
growth of Escherichia coli (bacteria) and MS2 bacteriophages (virus). When used 
with a stainless-steel plate, electricity increased bacteria reduction by 39.5 ± 
2.30% in comparison with no electricity added, whereas a three-layer physical 
barrier decreased its efficiency. Copper also reduced the growth of bacteria, by 
58.2 ± 8.23%, and the addition of electricity reduced it further (79.5 ± 2.34%). 
Bacteriophages were also affected by the metal contact. Further experiments 
showed that MS2 was also reduced by copper, to 82.9 ± 4.5% after 24 h at 37 °C.

Bacteriophage MS2 is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus encapsulated in 
an asymmetric T = 3 pseudo-icosahedral capsid. It infects Escherichia coli 
through the F-pilus, in which it binds through a maturation protein incorporated 
into its capsid. Cryogenic electron microscopy has previously shown that its 
genome is highly ordered within virions, and that it regulates the assembly 
process of the capsid. In this study, we have assembled recombinant MS2 capsids 
with non-genomic RNA containing the capsid incorporation sequence, and 
investigated the structures formed, revealing that T = 3, T = 4 and mixed 
capsids between these two triangulation numbers are generated, and resolving 
structures of T = 3 and T = 4 capsids to 4 Å and 6 Å respectively. We conclude 
that the basic MS2 capsid can form a mix of T = 3 and T = 4 structures, 
supporting a role for the ordered genome in favouring the formation of 
functional T = 3 virions.

Affinity selection using phage-display technologies is a powerful tool for 
identifying the peptide epitopes of monoclonal antibodies. Coupling affinity 
selection with deep sequencing technologies allows for the broad assessment of 
selectant populations. Here, we describe a method for using a phage-display 
platform to assess antibody specificity in human serum. We describe the method 
with reference to the bacteriophage MS2 virus-like particle (VLP) platform, but 
it can be adapted to other phage-display technologies as well.

Direct sequencing of RNA with MinION Nanopore: detecting mutations based on 
associations.

One of the key challenges in the field of genetics is the inference of 
haplotypes from next generation sequencing data. The MinION Oxford Nanopore 
sequencer allows sequencing long reads, with the potential of sequencing 
complete genes, and even complete genomes of viruses, in individual reads. 
However, MinION suffers from high error rates, rendering the detection of true 
variants difficult. Here, we propose a new statistical approach named AssociVar, 
which differentiates between true mutations and sequencing errors from direct 
RNA/DNA sequencing using MinION. Our strategy relies on the assumption that 
sequencing errors will be dispersed randomly along sequencing reads, and hence 
will not be associated with each other, whereas real mutations will display a 
non-random pattern of association with other mutations. We demonstrate our 
approach using direct RNA sequencing data from evolved populations of the MS2 
bacteriophage, whose small genome makes it ideal for MinION sequencing. 
AssociVar inferred several mutations in the phage genome, which were 
corroborated using parallel Illumina sequencing. This allowed us to reconstruct 
full genome viral haplotypes constituting different strains that were present in 
the sample. Our approach is applicable to long read sequencing data from any 
organism for accurate detection of bona fide mutations and inter-strain 
polymorphisms.

Arboviruses have been emerging and reemerging worldwide, predominantly in 
tropical and subtropical areas. As many arbovirus infections, including dengue 
(DENV), Zika (ZIKV), and chikungunya (CHIKV), have similar signs and symptoms, 
clinical diagnosis of arbovirus infections is challenging. Therefore, reliable 
laboratory tests are necessary to improve the clinical management of patients 
with suspected arbovirus infections. Real-time reverse-transcription PCR 
(RT-qPCR) is among the more effective methods to distinguish these viruses. The 
aim of this study was to construct a unique positive external control derived 
from a unique plasmid using genetic engineering for specific use in RT-qPCR 
assays to detect Zika, dengue (1-4), and chikungunya. An external control 
derived from the MS2 bacteriophage was constructed using sequences from 
arbovirus and human genomes. Laboratories were asked to test the control in the 
ZDC Biomol kit, a RT-qPCR kit which is able to detect Zika, dengue serotypes 
1-4, chikungunya, and an internal human control. RNA extracted from the external 
control was able to be amplified and detected in RT-qPCR assays for each virus 
detected by using the ZDC Biomol kit. The external control, samples from viral 
culture, and infected patient samples display similar amplification using this 
assay. The pET47b(+)MS2-ZDC vector is a viable expression system for the 
production of external control viral-like particles (MS2-ZDC). The RNA from the 
recombinant particles can be easily extracted and can function as a tool to 
validate all steps of process from the extraction to the amplification of all 
targets in specific reaction. Thus, the MS2-ZDC particles are laboratory-safe in 
order to avoid risk for operators, and the phages are effective as positive 
control for use in the ZDC Biomol kit amplifying all kit targets making them 
effective for commercial profile.

Contamination of potable groundwater by pathogenic viruses from on-site 
wastewater treatment systems (OWTS) poses a serious health risk. This study 
investigated the attenuation and transport of rotavirus, bacteriophage MS2 and 
DNA-labelled-glycoprotein-coated silica nanoparticles (DGSnp) in 2 intact cores 
of silt loam over gravels dosed with wastewater from an OWTS at 3.53 L/day. To 
simulate a worst-case scenario, experiments were conducted under saturated 
conditions. The results from 6 experiments demonstrated that the rotavirus and 
DGSnp reductions were very similar and markedly greater than the MS2 reduction. 
This was reflected in the peak concentrations, relative mass recoveries, and 
temporal and spatial reduction rates. For a given log10 reduction, the estimated 
soil depth required for MS2 was over twice that required for rotavirus and 
DGSnp. This is the first study in which DGSnp was used as a rotavirus surrogate 
in soil under wastewater applications. Consistent with previous studies, DGSnp 
showed promise at mimicking rotavirus attenuation and transport in porous media. 
The results suggest DGSnp could be used to assess the attenuation capacity of 
subsurface media to rotavirus. However, DGSnp is not conservative and will 
underestimate the setback distances required for rotavirus reductions by 3%. On 
the other hand, separation distances determined using the rotavirus parameters 
and criteria but based on MS2 attenuation, can be too conservative in some 
subsurface media. To determine safe and realistic separation distances, it would 
be beneficial and complementary to apply both conservative virus surrogate using 
MS2 bacteriophage and representative but non-conservative new virus surrogates 
using biomolecule-modified silica nanoparticles.

Unambiguous imaging of C → U edited mRNA calls for a method that distinguishes a 
locally high concentration of unbound probe or single nucleotide mismatched 
target from a locally low concentration of matched mRNA target. To address this 
issue, we combine FIT probes as a "chemical" detection system with the 
"biological" MS2 technique. Ratio measurements provide a convenient parameter to 
discriminate the edited from the unedited state of mRNA encoding for GlyR α2 in 
HEK cells.

The high frequency and intensity of urban floods caused by climate change, 
urbanisation and infrastructure failures increase public health risks when the 
flood water contaminated from combined sewer overflows (CSOs) or other sources 
of faecal contamination remains on urban surfaces. This study contributes to a 
better understanding of the effects of urban and recreational surfaces on the 
occurrence of waterborne pathogens. The inactivation of selected indicator 
organisms was studied under controlled exposure to artificial sunlight for 6 h 
followed by 18 h in dark conditions. Concrete, asphalt, pavement blocks and 
glass as control were inoculated with artificial floodwater containing, as 
indicator organisms, Escherichia coli bacteria, which are common faecal 
indicator bacteria (FIB) for water quality assessment, Bacillus subtilis spores 
chosen as surrogates for Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts and Giardia cysts, and 
bacteriophages MS2 as indicators for viral contamination. On practically all the 
surfaces in this study, E. coli had the highest inactivation under light 
conditions followed by MS2 and B. subtilis, except asphalt where MS2 was 
inactivated faster. The highest inactivation under light conditions was seen 
with E. coli on a concrete surface (pH 9.6) with an inactivation rate of 
1.85 h-1. However, the pH of the surfaces (varying between 7.0 and 9.6) did not 
have any influence on inactivation rates under dark conditions. MS2 
bacteriophage had the highest inactivation under light conditions on asphalt 
with a rate of 1.29 h-1. No die-off of B. subtilis spores was observed on any of 
the surfaces during the experiment, neither in light nor in dark conditions. 
This study underpins the need to use different indicator organisms to test their 
inactivation after flooding. It also suggests that given the sunlight 
conditions, concentration of indicator organisms and type of surface, the fate 
of waterborne pathogens after a flood could be estimated.

AIM: Infiltration experiments aimed to show the effectivity of coral sand to 
remove micro-organisms in septic tank wastewater treatment system, in South 
Tarawa, Kiribati.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Laboratory experiments evaluated effective microbial 
removal properties of a packed bed of coral beach sand conditioned with domestic 
effluent. Bacterial and viral indicators Escherichia coli J6-2, Enterococci 
faecalis and f-RNA (MS2) bacteriophage, along with viral pathogens adenovirus, 
echovirus, norovirus and rotavirus, were dosed (at 106 -107  CFU, PFU or genome 
copies per ml concentration) with effluent to unsaturated coral sand-packed 
columns. For the conditions simulated, all organisms showed removal efficiencies 
of >4-Log Removal Values (LRVs) (i.e. >99·99% effective reduction in number). 
Results revealed that the conditioned coral sand had a higher affinity for 
attenuating viruses than the bacteria tested. MS2 phage, adenovirus, echovirus, 
norovirus and rotavirus were absent in leachate from the base of the sand 
columns. E. coli J6-2 and E. faecalis were recovered at 100 -101  CFU (colony 
forming units) per ml in the column effluent, following a dosage of 106  CFU per 
ml. Destructive sampling of the columns after experiments revealed that a high 
proportion of viral pathogens were retained in the top 30 mm of the sand.
CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the relative spatial distribution of trace 
organisms in the sand, we speculate that adsorption processes likely dominated 
attenuation of the viral pathogens, more so than physical straining effects. 
Further study is required to fully elucidate the removal mechanisms.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: To the best of our knowledge this is the 
first study of the effective microbial removal capacity of coral sand under 
unsaturated conditions. The work represents an initial exploratory step of 
developing some standardized design practice of on-site wastewater treatment 
systems in Kiribati, to offer enhanced protection of groundwater resources and 
reduce diarrhoeal disease.

Virus removal can be successfully achieved based on an electrostatic adsorption 
mechanism. The key requirement for this process is to develop filter materials 
that can be produced by low-cost technologies and are suitable in large-scale 
production for real applications. In this study, we report development of 
spray-dried alumina granules modified with copper (oxide) nanoparticles and 
critically assess the effect of copper oxidation state on virus removal 
capacity. Using plate-shaped alumina as a support material resulted in porous 
structure, which in turn ensured prolonged contact time of contaminated water 
with the material. Subsequently, copper (oxide) nanoparticles provided a large 
number of adsorption sites. Flow experiments revealed that copper(I) oxide and 
metallic copper were the active phases in virus removal and 99.9% of MS2 
bacteriophages could be removed. However, almost no virus removal was observed 
in the presence of copper(II) oxide. Contrasting virus removal characteristics 
are associated with the different surface charge of copper species, as 
determined by zeta potential measurements.

Virus-like particle (VLP) conjugates are being developed for biomedical 
applications; however, there is a lack of quantitative analytical methods to 
measure the extent of conjugation and modification of VLP based therapeutics. 
Charge detection mass spectrometry (CDMS) can measure mass distributions for 
large and heterogeneous complexes and is emerging as a valuable tool in the 
analysis of biologics. In this study, CDMS is used to characterize the 
stoichiometry and population distribution of antibodies covalently conjugated to 
the surface of a bacteriophage MS2 VLP. Initial CDMS analysis of the 
unconjugated MS2 particles suggested that they had packaged a broad distribution 
of exogenous genomic material. We developed procedures to remove the undesired 
genomic material from the VLP preparation and observed that, for the samples 
where the genomic fragments were removed, the antibody coupling reaction 
efficiency increased by almost a factor of 2. This meant there were (1) fewer 
VLPs with no antibodies bound, which is an important consideration for the 
efficacy of a targeted therapeutic and (2) fewer antibodies were wasted during 
the coupling reaction. CDMS could be employed in a similar manner as a tool to 
characterize coupling reaction product distributions and precursors and help 
inform the development of the next generation of conjugate-based therapies.

Virus-like Particle-Based L2 Vaccines against HPVs: Where Are We Today?

Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the most common sexually transmitted 
infections worldwide. Ninety percent of infected individuals clear the infection 
within two years; however, in the remaining 10% of infected individuals, the 
infection(s) persists and ultimately leads to cancers (anogenital cancers and 
head and neck cancers) and genital warts. Fortunately, three prophylactic 
vaccines have been approved to protect against HPV infections. The most recent 
HPV vaccine, Gardasil-9 (a nonavalent vaccine), protects against seven HPV types 
associated with ~90% of cervical cancer and against two HPV types associated 
with ~90% genital warts with little cross-protection against non-vaccine HPV 
types. The current vaccines are based on virus-like particles (VLPs) derived 
from the major capsid protein, L1. The L1 protein is not conserved among HPV 
types. The minor capsid protein, L2, on the other hand, is highly conserved 
among HPV types and has been an alternative target antigen, for over two 
decades, to develop a broadly protective HPV vaccine. The L2 protein, unlike the 
L1, cannot form VLPs and as such, it is less immunogenic. This review summarizes 
current studies aimed at developing HPV L2 vaccines by multivalently displaying 
L2 peptides on VLPs derived from bacteriophages and eukaryotic viruses. Recent 
data show that a monovalent HPV L1 VLP as well as bivalent MS2 VLPs displaying 
HPV L2 peptides (representing amino acids 17-36 and/or consensus amino acids 
69-86) elicit robust broadly protective antibodies against diverse HPV types 
(6/11/16/18/26/31/33/34/35/39/43/44/45/51/52/53/56/58/59/66/68/73) associated 
with cancers and genital warts. Thus, VLP-based L2 vaccines look promising and 
may be favorable, in the near future, over current L1-based HPV vaccines and 
should be explored further.

Propolis is a natural product of bees with biological activities that are mainly 
associated with bee type and geographic origin. Propolis extract has been 
proposed with several applications in environmental health. The ethanol extracts 
have shown good antimicrobial activity. The association of this technique with 
ultrasound-assisted extraction has been studied to improve the characteristics 
of the obtained extracts. Thus, the objective of this work is to verify the 
antiviral action against two strains of bacteriophages of two extracts of 
Brazilian propolis (green and red) obtained by conventional extraction and 
ultrasonic extraction. The activities of the propolis red and green extracts 
were confirmed by the significant ~3 and ~4.5 Log 10 PFU/mL reduction in the 
concentrations of the MS2 and Av-08 bacteriophages, respectively. It was found 
that ultrasound-assisted extraction is comparable to the maceration process and 
demonstrated the best antiviral activities. Brazilian red propolis was more 
effective than green propolis in viral reduction in all treatments.

The newly emerged nanopore sequencing technology such as MinION™ allows for 
real-time detection of long DNA/RNA fragments on a portable device, yet few have 
examined its performance for environmental viromes. Here we seeded one RNA virus 
bacteriophage MS2 and one DNA virus bacteriophage PhiX174 into 10 L well water 
at three levels ranging from 1 to 21,100 plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL. Two 
workflows were established to maximize the number of sequencing reads of RNA and 
DNA viruses using MinION™. With dead-end ultrafiltration, PEG precipitation, and 
random amplification, MinION™ was capable of detecting MS2 at 155 PFU/mL and 
PhiX174 at 1-2 PFU/mL. While the DNA workflow only detected PhiX174, the RNA 
workflow detected both MS2 and PhiX174. The virus concentration, or relative 
abundance of viral nucleic acids in total nucleic acids, is critical to the 
proportion of viral reads in sequencing results. Our findings also highlight the 
importance of including control samples in sequencing runs for environmental 
water samples with low virus abundance.

Outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis are often connected to contaminated drinking 
water. The assessment of the water quality relies on the cultivation of 
indicator bacteria, and little is known of the fate of viruses in groundwater, 
especially in arctic regions. In Iceland, the groundwater temperature is between 
3 and 6°C. The aim of this study was to determine virus inactivation at low 
temperature in a groundwater microcosm and in a borehole in a postglacial lava 
field. Two phage species that are commonly used as surrogates for norovirus were 
used, MS2 and PhiX174. Dialysis bags were used for the samples, and a device was 
constructed to hold many samples at a time and protect the samples in the 
borehole. No significant decrease of infective PhiX174 phages in the borehole or 
of the MS2 phages in the microcosm was observed. A slightly significant decrease 
of PhiX174 in the microcosm was noticed, with one log reduction time of 476 
days. On the other hand, a significant reduction in MS2 was found in the field 
test, where the time needed for 90% reduction was 12·5 days. The results showed 
that an infective virus can exist in groundwater for months or years in arctic 
regions and a great difference may exist between results from microcosm and 
field tests. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study reveals that 
arctic regions are highly sensitive to virus contamination as an infective virus 
may exist in groundwater for years at low temperature. The results also show 
that the virus inactivation observed in field tests may differ considerably from 
the inactivation observed in laboratory microcosms. The results emphasize the 
importance of large protection zones around drinking water intakes as well as 
good wastewater treatment so that the likelihood of faecal contamination of 
groundwater is reduced.

Next generation sequencing (NGS) approaches are increasingly applied to tracing 
microbial contaminants entering the food chain due to NGS' untargeted nature and 
ability to investigate non-culturable (and/or difficult to culture) organisms 
while yielding genomic information about the microbiota. So far, a plethora of 
microbes has been shown to be associated with fresh produce, but few studies 
have utilised NGS to identify contamination with human pathogens. This study 
aims to establish the limit of detection (LoD) for Salmonella and phage MS2 (a 
Norovirus surrogate) contamination of fresh produce employing NGS approaches on 
the Illumina MiSeq: 16S amplicon-sequencing, and RNA-seq, using ScriptSeq 
(Illumina) and NEBNext (New England BioLabs) kits. ScriptSeq proved the most 
sensitive approach; delivering an LoD of 104 CFU reaction-1 (Colony Forming 
Units) for Salmonella and 105 PFU reaction-1 (Plaque Forming Units) for phage 
MS2. Use of the NEBNext kit resulted in detection of Salmonella at 106 CFU 
reaction-1 and phage MS2 at 107 PFU reaction-1. 16S amplicon-sequencing yielded 
a similar LoD of 105 CFU reaction-1 for Salmonella but could not detect MS2. The

Viruses are transmissible via their interaction with contact surfaces of food 
containers or tools. This study evaluated the recoveries of MS2 coliphage, a 
virus surrogate, from polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene 
(PE), and glass (borosilicate and soda lime), as influenced by the surface 
chemistry and topography. MS2 (5-6 logs) in PBS with 1% TSB was inoculated onto 
each of 9 different surfaces, 24-h cold-incubated, and recovery was quantified 
by infectivity. The order of MS2 recovery efficiency from smooth surfaces was 
PP > PE ≥ soda lime glass, which classified into 3 ANOVA groups, p = 0.05. The 
MS2 recovery ratios of smooth vs. rough surfaces were 1.4-1.5. Atomic force 
microscopy revealed 21-nm diam pinholes (<28-nm of MS2 size) in the borosilicate 
glass. The lowest and highest MS2 recoveries among the 9 surfaces were 
demonstrated by the hole-bearing borosilicate glass (34 ± 8%) and smooth PP 
(69 ± 14%) respectively. Generally greater MS2 recovery was obtained from smooth 
PP and PE surfaces compared to glass, but topographic alterations (pinholes or 
increased roughness) decreased recovery possibly by trapping the viruses.

Performance of UV reactors for water disinfection is investigated in this paper. 
Both experimental and numerical studies are performed on base reactor LP24. 
Enterobacteria phage MS2 is chosen as the challenge microorganism in the 
experiments. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the effect of different 
parameters, i.e. flow rate and UV transmission, on the reactor performance. 
Simulation is carried out based on the commercial software ANSYS FLUENT with 
user defined functions (UDFs) implemented. The UDF is programmed to calculate UV 
dose absorbed by different microorganisms along their flow trajectories. The 
effect with boundary layer mesh and without boundary layer mesh for LP24 is 
studied. The results show that the inclusion of boundary layer mesh does not 
have much effect on the reactor performance in terms of reduction equivalent 
dose (RED). The numerical results agree well with the experimental measurements, 
hence validating the numerical model. With this achieved, the numerical model is 
applied to study other scaled reactors: LP12, LP40, LP60 and LP80. Comparisons 
show that LP40 has the highest RED and log inactivation among all the reactors 
while LP80 has the lowest RED and log inactivation.

OBJECTIVE: To assess potential transmission of antibiotic-resistant organisms 
(AROs) using surrogate markers and bacterial cultures.
DESIGN: Pilot study.
SETTING: A 1,260-bed tertiary-care academic medical center.
PARTICIPANTS: The study included 25 patients (17 of whom were on contact 
precautions for AROs) and 77 healthcare personnel (HCP).
METHODS: Fluorescent powder (FP) and MS2 bacteriophage were applied in patient 
rooms. HCP visits to each room were observed for 2-4 hours; hand hygiene (HH) 
compliance was recorded. Surfaces inside and outside the room and HCP skin and 
clothing were assessed for fluorescence, and swabs were collected for MS2 
detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and selective bacterial cultures.
RESULTS: Transfer of FP was observed for 20 rooms (80%) and 26 HCP (34%). 
Transfer of MS2 was detected for 10 rooms (40%) and 15 HCP (19%). Bacterial 
cultures were positive for 1 room and 8 HCP (10%). Interactions with patients on 
contact precautions resulted in fewer FP detections than interactions with 
patients not on precautions (P < .001); MS2 detections did not differ by patient 
isolation status. Fluorescent powder detections did not differ by HCP type, but 
MS2 was recovered more frequently from physicians than from nurses (P = .03). 
Overall, HH compliance was better among HCP caring for patients on contact 
precautions than among HCP caring for patients not on precautions (P = .003), 
among nurses than among other nonphysician HCP at room entry (P = .002), and 
among nurses than among physicians at room exit (P = .03). Moreover, HCP who 
performed HH prior to assessment had fewer fluorescence detections (P = .008).
CONCLUSIONS: Contact precautions were associated with greater HCP HH compliance 
and reduced detection of FP and MS2.

Ceramic pot filters are household water treatment and safe storage (HWTS) 
systems designed to improve the microbial quality of drinking water. They yield 
high log reduction values (LRVs) for bacterial and protozoan pathogens but 
provide very little removal of viruses. This study investigated virus removal of 
ceramic filter discs (CFDs), using feed water with 3 different nutrient levels 
under extended continuous operation and limited cleaning frequency. The results 
show that filter use without cleaning resulted in biofilm growth and MS2 LRV 
values increased with increasing feed water nutrient content. Cleaning the 
filter surface by scrubbing led to a partial or total loss in improved LRVs, 
indicating the importance of this biological top layer to the removal of MS2. 
Overall, the removal capacity of a matured biofilm remained constant, regardless 
of its age. MS2 LRVs ranged between 0.9 ± 0.2 LRV for low nutrient (LN), 
1.6 ± 0.2 LRV for medium nutrient (MN) and 2.4 ± 0.5 LRV for high nutrient (HN) 
biofilms. Interestingly, a change in feed conditions for the HN filters resulted 
in an unprecedented high LRV of >4 LRV, which supports further investigation of 
the mechanistic role of biofilms in virus removal.

Enteric viruses, such as enterovirus, norovirus, and rotavirus, are among the 
leading causes of disease outbreaks due to contaminated drinking and 
recreational water. Viruses are difficult to remove from water through 
filtration based on physical size exclusion-for example by gravity-driven 
filters-due to their nanoscale size. To understand virus removal in drinking 
water treatment systems, the colloidal nanostructure of a model virus, the MS2 
bacteriophage, has been investigated in relation to the effect of pH and natural 
organic matter in water. Dynamic light scattering, small-angle X-ray scattering, 
and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that the water pH 
has a major influence on the colloidal structure of the virus: The bacteriophage 
MS2's structure in water in the range pH = 7.0 to 9.0 was found to be spherical 
with core-shell-type structure with a total diameter of 27 nm and a core radius 
of around 8 nm. Reversible transformations from 27 nm particles at pH = 7.0 to 
micrometer-sized aggregates at pH = 3.0 were observed. In addition, the presence 
of natural organic matter that simulates the organic components present in 
surface water was found to enhance repulsion between virus particles, reduce the 
size of aggregates, and promote disaggregation upon pH increase. These findings 
allow a better understanding of virus interactions in water and have 
implications for water treatment using filtration processes and coagulation. The 
results will further guide the comprehensive design of advanced virus filter 
materials.

Ebola virus (EBOV) disease outbreaks, as well as the ability of EBOV to persist 
in the environment under certain conditions, highlight the need to develop 
effective decontamination techniques against the virus. We evaluated the 
efficacy of hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV) to inactivate MS2 and Phi6 
bacteriophages, the latter a recommended surrogate for EBOV. The phages were 
inoculated onto six material types with and without the presence of whole human 
blood. The inoculated materials were then exposed to either a high or low 
concentration of HPV for various elapsed times. The phages were also recovered 
from positive controls at these same elapsed times, to assess environmental 
persistence and decontamination efficacy. Low concentration hydrogen peroxide 
vapor (LCHP; 25 ppm) was effective against both phages on all materials without 
the presence of blood at 2 h. LCHP was ineffective against the phages in the 
presence of blood, on all materials, even with a 3-day contact time. Higher 
concentrations of HPV (>400 ppm) with contact times of 24-32 h achieved 
approximately 2-6 log reduction of the phages in the presence of blood.

The first sequenced genome was that of the 3569-nucleotide single-stranded RNA 
(ssRNA) bacteriophage MS2. Despite the recent accumulation of vast amounts of 
DNA and RNA sequence data, only 12 representative ssRNA phage genome sequences 
are available from the NCBI Genome database (June 2019). The difficulty in 
detecting RNA phages in metagenomic datasets raises questions as to their 
abundance, taxonomic structure, and ecological importance. In this study, we 
iteratively applied profile hidden Markov models to detect conserved ssRNA phage 
proteins in 82 publicly available metatranscriptomic datasets generated from 
activated sludge and aquatic environments. We identified 15,611 nonredundant 
ssRNA phage sequences, including 1015 near-complete genomes. This expansion in 
the number of known sequences enabled us to complete a phylogenetic assessment 
of both sequences identified in this study and known ssRNA phage genomes. Our 
expansion of these viruses from two environments suggests that they have been 
overlooked within microbiome studies.

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSv) is one of the most 
significant airborne viruses impacting the pork industry in the US. Non-thermal 
plasmas (NTPs) are electrical discharges comprised of reactive radicals and 
excited species that inactivate viruses and bacteria. Our previous experiments 
using a packed bed NTP reactor demonstrated effective inactivation of 
bacteriophage MS2 as a function of applied voltage and power. The present study 
examined the effectiveness of the same reactor in inactivating aerosolized 
PRRSv. A PRRSv solution containing ∼105 TCID50/ml of PRRSv VR2332 strain was 
aerosolized at 3 ml/min by an air-jet nebulizer and introduced into 5 or 12 cfm 
air flow followed by NTP exposure in the reactor. Twin impingers upstream and 
downstream of the reactor collected samples of the virus-laden air flow for 
subsequent TCID50 assay and qPCR analyses. An optical particle sizer measured 
upstream and downstream aerosol size distributions, giving estimates of aerosol 
filtration by the reactor. The results showed that PRRSv was inactivated to a 
similar degree as MS2 at the same conditions, with the maximum 1.3-log 
inactivation of PRRSv achieved at 20 kV and 12 cfm air flow rate. The results 
demonstrate the potential of properly optimized NTPs in controlling PRRSv 
transmission.

RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play key roles in many aspects of RNA metabolism. In 
Leishmania, a unicellular eukaryote that favors the posttranscriptional mode of 
regulation for controlling gene expression levels, the function of RBPs becomes 
even more critical. However, due largely to limited in vivo approaches available 
for identifying RBPs in these parasites, there have been no significant advances 
to our understanding of the role these proteins play in posttranscriptional 
control through binding to cis-acting elements in the 3' untranslated region 
(3'UTR) of mRNAs. Here we describe an optimized in vivo RNA tethering approach 
using the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein combined to immunoprecipitation and 
mass spectrometry analysis to identify RBPs specifically interacting with 3'UTR 
short interspersed degenerated retroposon elements (SIDERs). Members of the 
SIDER2 subfamily were shown previously to promote mRNA degradation through a 
novel mechanism of mRNA decay. Using this modified MS2 tethering approach, we 
have identified candidate RBPs specifically interacting with SIDER2 elements and 
contributing to the decay mechanism.

This study was designed to test the efficacy of an air treatment using ozone and 
relative humidity (RH) for the inactivation of airborne viruses. Four phages 
(φX174, PR772, MS2 and φ6) and one eukaryotic virus (murine norovirus MNV-1) 
were exposed to low ozone concentrations (1.23 ppm for phages and 0.23 ppm for 
MNV-1) and various levels of RH for 10 to 70 minutes. The inactivation of these 
viruses was then assessed to determine which of the tested conditions provided 
the greatest reduction in virus infectivity. An inactivation of at least two 
orders of magnitude for φX174, MS2 and MNV-1 was achieved with an ozone exposure 
of 40 minutes at 85% RH. For PR772 and φ6, exposure to the reference condition 
at 20% RH for 10 minutes yielded the same results. These findings suggest that 
ozone used at a low concentration is a powerful disinfectant for airborne 
viruses when combined with a high RH. Air treatment could therefore be 
implemented inside hospital rooms ventilated naturally.

Liquid impingers are utilized to collect bioaerosols for many advantages, such 
as avoiding dehydration of biological agents. However, many previous studies 
have reported that the liquid impingers are surprisingly inefficient for the 
collection of ultrafine bioaerosols, with collection efficiencies <30%. In the 
present work, we have successfully improved the collection efficiency of the 
liquid impinger (AGI30) to as high as 99% for particles in the size range of 
20-400 nm with the aid of packed glass beads. We also systematically 
investigated the effects of influential factors on the collection efficiency. 
These factors include the volume of the sampling liquid (0, 20 and 30 mL), depth 
(0, 7 and 10 cm) of packed glass beads and sampling flow rate (4, 6 and 8 liter 
per min, lpm). According to our experimental results, increasing the depth of 
packed glass beads and the volume of sampling liquid can enhance the collection 
efficiency. Also, decreasing the sampling flow rate can increase the collection 
efficiency and reduce the loss of sampling liquid. For the sampling of viable 
MS2 phages, the collection efficiency of AGI30 sampler with packed glass beads 
is much higher than that without packed glass beads. Conclusively, this study 
validates that the granular bed filtration can enhance the collection efficiency 
of liquid impingers for submicron and ultrafine particles and viral aerosols.

Outbreaks of airborne infectious diseases such as measles or severe acute 
respiratory syndrome can cause significant public alarm. Where ventilation 
systems facilitate disease transmission to humans or animals, there exists a 
need for control measures that provide effective protection while imposing 
minimal pressure differential. In the present study, viral aerosols in an 
airstream were subjected to non-thermal plasma (NTP) exposure within a 
packed-bed dielectric barrier discharge reactor. Comparisons of plaque assays 
before and after NTP treatment found exponentially increasing inactivation of 
aerosolized MS2 phage with increasing applied voltage. At 30 kV and an air flow 
rate of 170 standard liters per minute, a greater than 2.3 log reduction of 
infective virus was achieved across the reactor. This reduction represented ~2 
log of the MS2 inactivated and ~0.35 log physically removed in the packed bed. 
Increasing the air flow rate from 170 to 330 liters per minute did not 
significantly impact virus inactivation effectiveness. Activated carbon-based 
ozone filters greatly reduced residual ozone, in some cases down to background 
levels, while adding less than 20 Pa pressure differential to the 45 Pa 
differential pressure across the packed bed at the flow rate of 170 standard

UV light-emitting diodes (UV-LEDs) have emerged as a new technology for water 
disinfection. Multiwell plates are a common tool in biological research, but 
they have never been used for UVC/UVB-inactivation experiments of 
microorganisms. In this study, a novel, rapid and simple UVC/UVB-inactivation 
assay was developed for a UV-LED system using a multiwell plate setup (96- and 
24-well plates). The relative incident irradiance distribution across the 
exposed area was examined by spectroradiometry and nitrate-nitrite uniformity 
assay. The two methods showed a good correlation and high distribution factors 
(>0.89 and >0.94 for 96- and 24-well plates, respectively). In addition, the 
potential of the new system for determining disinfection efficacy of E. coli and 
MS2 coliphage by UV-LEDs emitting at central wavelengths of 265 nm and 285 nm 
was demonstrated. The inactivation rate constants were comparable to those 
obtained using UV-LED systems with the conventional dish (or beaker) setup, but 
the multiwell plate method allowed for many more repetitions. The proposed 
system is an alternative for UV-inactivation dose-response assay, especially 
when screening assays are desired, since it has the advantage of being fast, 
comprehensive (with a large number of simultaneous replicates) and easily 
adapted to various applications as UV-LED based photocatalysis experiments, UV 
effect on biofilm formation and UV-based AOP degradation experiments.

Effect of Filtration Conditions On Removal of Emerging waterborne pathogens.

Harrington GW, Xagoraraki I, Assavasilavasukul P, Standridge JH.

This study evaluated removal of live emerging waterborne pathogens by 
pilot-scale conventional treatment with alum coagulation, flocculation, 
sedimentation, and filtration. The microbes tested were Cryptosporidium parvum 
oocysts, Encephalitozoon intestinalis spores, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli 
O157:H7, Aeromonas hydrophila, and bacteriophage MS2. The study showed the 
effects of filter run time, alternative loading rates, alternative filter media, 
and pH on pathogen removal. Results indicated that turbidity breakthrough was 
accompanied by breakthrough of all pathogens tested in this study. Results also 
suggest that the breakthrough of A. hydrophila and E. coli O157:H7 occurred more 
rapidly than that of turbidity. In general, filtration rate or alternative 
filter media configurations had no apparent effect on pathogen removal.

MS-2 and T4 phage removal in an anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR): effect of 
gas sparging rate.

BACKGROUND: The enhanced removal of viruses in wastewater treatments plant is 
important due to concerns about public health. Bacteriophages (or phages) are 
often used to model the behavior of pathogenic human viruses as they are similar 
in size, structure and behavior. This study investigated the removal of phages 
MS-2 (25 nm) and T4 (200 nm) in an anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) with a 
membrane pore size of 0.4 µm.
RESULTS: The membrane reactor without biomass was assessed and its log removal 
was 0.7 ± 0.4 log for the MS-2 phage, and 2.3 ± 0.2 log for the T4. When 
anaerobic biomass was added to the reactor the log removal for both phages 
increased, and this was thought to be due to a complex relationship with the 
biofilm on the membrane.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall MS-2 rejections ranged from 1.75 up to 5.5 log, with the 
highest rejections observed at the highest sparging rates after extensive 
fouling had occurred. For T4, removal in the AnMBR ranged from 5 log up to 
complete removal (>log 7). © 2014 Society of Chemical Industry.

We report the asymmetric reconstruction of the single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) 
content in one of the three otherwise identical virions of a multipartite RNA 
virus, brome mosaic virus (BMV). We exploit a sample consisting exclusively of 
particles with the same RNA content-specifically, RNAs 3 and 4-assembled in 
planta by agrobacterium-mediated transient expression. We find that the interior 
of the particle is nearly empty, with most of the RNA genome situated at the 
capsid shell. However, this density is disordered in the sense that the RNA is 
not associated with any particular structure but rather, with an ensemble of 
secondary/tertiary structures that interact with the capsid protein. Our results 
illustrate a fundamental difference between the ssRNA organization in the 
multipartite BMV viral capsid and the monopartite bacteriophages MS2 and Qβ for 
which a dominant RNA conformation is found inside the assembled viral capsids, 
with RNA density conserved even at the center of the particle. This can be 
understood in the context of the differing demands on their respective 
lifecycles: BMV must package separately each of several different RNA molecules 
and has been shown to replicate and package them in isolated, membrane-bound, 
cytoplasmic complexes, whereas the bacteriophages exploit sequence-specific 
"packaging signals" throughout the viral RNA to package their monopartite 
genomes.

BACKGROUND: Shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) including N95 
respirators are an urgent concern in the setting of the global COVID-19 
pandemic. Decontamination of PPE could be useful to maintain adequate supplies, 
but there is uncertainty regarding the efficacy of decontamination technologies.
METHODS: A modification of the American Society for Testing and Materials 
standard quantitative carrier disk test method (ASTM E-2197-11) was used to 
examine the effectiveness of 3 methods, including ultraviolet-C (UV-C) light, a 
high-level disinfection cabinet that generates aerosolized peracetic acid and 
hydrogen peroxide, and dry heat at 70°C for 30 minutes. We assessed the 
decontamination of 3 commercial N95 respirators inoculated with 
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and bacteriophages MS2 and 
Phi6; the latter is an enveloped RNA virus used as a surrogate for 
coronaviruses. Three and 6 log10 reductions on respirators were considered 
effective for decontamination and disinfection, respectively.
RESULTS: UV-C administered as a 1-minute cycle in a UV-C box or a 30-minute 
cycle by a room decontamination device reduced contamination but did not meet 
criteria for decontamination of the viruses from all sites on the N95s. The 
high-level disinfection cabinet was effective for decontamination of the N95s 
and achieved disinfection with an extended 31-minute cycle. Dry heat at 70°C for 
30 minutes was not effective for decontamination of the bacteriophages.
CONCLUSIONS: UV-C could be useful to reduce contamination on N95 respirators. 
However, the UV-C technologies studied did not meet pre-established criteria for 
decontamination under the test conditions used. The high-level disinfection 
cabinet was more effective and met criteria for disinfection with an extended 
cycle.

Both multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and metal or metal oxides have 
demonstrated virus removal efficacy in drinking water applications. In this 
study, MWCNTs were coated with copper(I) oxide (Cu2O) using three distinct 
synthesis procedures (copper ion attachment, copper hydroxide precipitation, and 
[Cu(NH3)4]2+ complex attachment) and virus removal efficacy (using MS2 
bacteriophages) was evaluated. All synthesis procedures resulted in the presence 
of adsorbed, nanosized Cu2O particles on the MWCNTs, shown using X-ray 
diffraction. Further, transmission electron microscopy confirmed uniform 
copper(I) oxide distribution along the MWCNTs for all three materials. Virus 
removal efficacy was assessed for all three synthesised composites both before 
and after material conditioning (filtering for at least 24 h/280 mL/h), and 
accounting for additional MS2 inactivation in the permeate due to continued 
copper inactivation from dissolved/desorbed copper in permeate (time-control). 
Material conditioning influenced virus removal, with the first litres of water 
containing higher concentrations of copper than the sixth litres of water, 
suggesting excess or non-bonded copper species dissolve from filters. Higher 
copper dissolution was observed for water at pH 5 than at pH 7, which decreased 
with time. Copper dissolution most likely caused an associated decrease in 
copper adsorbed to MWCNTs in the filters, which may explain the observed lower 
MS2 removal efficacy after conditioning. Additionally, the time-control study 
(immediately after filtration as compared to 2 h after filtration) highlighted 
continued MS2 inactivation in the permeate over time. The obtained results 
indicate that the synthesis procedure influences virus removal efficacy for 
MWCNTs coated with copper oxides and that virus removal is likely due to not 
only virus electrostatic adsorption to the coated MWCNTs, but also through 
antiviral properties of copper which continues to act in the permeate. In 
conclusion, it is highly important to revise the methods of testing filter 
materials for virus removal, as well as procedure for virus concentration 
evaluation.

Sunlight-mediated inactivation of microorganisms is a low-cost approach to 
disinfect drinking water and wastewater. The reactions involved are affected by 
a wide range of factors, and a lack of knowledge about their relative importance 
makes it challenging to optimize treatment systems. To characterize the relative 
importance of environmental conditions, photoreactivity, water quality, and 
engineering design in the sunlight inactivation of viruses, we modeled the 
inactivation of three-human adenovirus and two bacteriophages-MS2 and phiX174-in 
surface waters and waste stabilization ponds by integrating solar irradiance and 
aquatic photochemistry models under uncertainty. Through global sensitivity 
analyses, we quantitatively apportioned the variability of predicted sunlight 
inactivation rate constants to different factors. Most variance was associated 
with the variability in and interactions among time, location, nonpurgeable 
organic carbon (NPOC) concentration, and pond depth. The photolysis quantum 
yield of the virus outweighed the seasonal solar motion in the impact on 
inactivation rates. Further, comparison of simulated sunlight inactivation 
efficacy in maturation ponds under different design decisions showed that 
reducing pond depth can increase the log inactivation at the cost of larger land 
area, but increasing hydraulic retention time by adding ponds in series yielded 
greater improvements in inactivation.

Update in
    mBio. 2020 Jun 25;11(3):

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused a severe, international shortage of N95 
respirators, which are essential to protect healthcare providers from infection. 
Given the contemporary limitations of the supply chain, it is imperative to 
identify effective means of decontaminating, reusing, and thereby conserving N95 
respirator stockpiles. To be effective, decontamination must result in 
sterilization of the N95 respirator without impairment of respirator filtration 
or user fit. Although numerous methods of N95 decontamination exist, none are 
universally accessible. In this work we describe a microwave-generated steam 
decontamination protocol for N95 respirators for use in healthcare systems of 
all sizes, geographies, and means. Using widely available glass containers, mesh 
from commercial produce bags, a rubber band, and a 1100W commercially available 
microwave, we constructed an effective, standardized, and reproducible means of 
decontaminating N95 respirators. Employing this methodology against MS2 phage, a 
highly conservative surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 contamination, we report an average 
6-log 10 plaque forming unit (PFU) (99.9999%) and a minimum 5-log 10 PFU 
(99.999%) reduction after a single three-minute microwave treatment. Notably, 
quantified respirator fit and function were preserved, even after 20 sequential 
cycles of microwave steam decontamination. This method provides a valuable means 
of effective decontamination and reuse of N95 respirators by frontline providers 
facing urgent need.

Current microbial exposure models assume that microbial exchange follows a 
concentration gradient during hand-to-surface contacts. Our objectives were to 
evaluate this assumption using transfer efficiency experiments and to evaluate a 
model's ability to explain concentration changes using approximate Bayesian 
computation (ABC) on these experimental data. Experiments were conducted with 
two phages (MS2, ΦX174) simultaneously to study bidirectional transfer. 
Concentrations on the fingertip and surface were quantified before and after 
fingertip-to-surface contacts. Prior distributions for surface and fingertip 
swabbing efficiencies and transfer efficiency were used to estimate 
concentrations on the fingertip and surface post contact. To inform posterior 
distributions, Euclidean distances were calculated for predicted detectable 
concentrations (log10 PFU cm-2) on the fingertip and surface post contact in 
comparison with experimental values. To demonstrate the usefulness of posterior 
distributions in calibrated model applications, posterior transfer efficiencies 
were used to estimate rotavirus infection risks for a fingertip-to-surface and 
subsequent fingertip-to-mouth contact. Experimental findings supported the 
transfer gradient assumption. Through ABC, the model explained concentration 
changes more consistently when concentrations on the fingertip and surface were 
similar. Future studies evaluating microbial transfer should consider accounting 
for differing fingertip-to-surface and surface-to-fingertip transfer 
efficiencies and extend this work for other microbial types.

Pathogenic enteric viruses and bacteriophages such as Qβ and MS2 are transmitted 
through the fecal-oral route. However, oxidants such as peroxynitrite (ONOOH) 
and hypochlorous acid (HClO) can prevent new infection by inactivating 
infectious viruses. Their virucidal effect is well recognized, and yet 
predicting the effects of oxidants on viruses is currently impossible because 
the detailed mechanisms of viral inactivation remain unclear. Our data show that 
ONOOH and HClO cross-linked the capsid proteins and RNA genomes of Qβ and MS2 
phages. Consistently, the capsids appeared intact by transmission electron 
microscopy (TEM) even when 99% of the phages were inactivated by oxidation. 
Moreover, a precise molecular study of the capsid proteins shows that ONOOH and 
HClO preferentially targeted capsid protein regions containing the 
oxidant-sensitive amino acid C, Y, or W. Interestingly, the interaction of these 
amino acids was a crucial parameter defining whether they would be modified by 
the addition of O, Cl, or NO2 or whether it induced the loss of the protein 
region detected by mass spectrometry, together suggesting potential sites for 
cross-link formation. Together, these data show that HClO and ONOOH consistently 
target oxidant-sensitive amino acids regardless of the structural organization 
of Qβ and MS2, even though the phenotypes change as a function of the 
interaction with adjacent proteins/RNA. These data also indicate a potential 
novel mechanism of viral inactivation in which cross-linking may impair 
infectivity.

BACKGROUND: Contaminated surfaces are a potential source for spread of 
respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV-2. Ultraviolet-C (UV-C) light is 
effective against RNA and DNA viruses and could be useful for decontamination of 
high-touch fomites that are shared by multiple users.
METHODS: A modification of the American Society for Testing and Materials 
standard quantitative carrier disk test method (ASTM E-2197-11) was used to 
examine the effectiveness of UV-C light for rapid decontamination of plastic 
airport security bins inoculated at 3 sites with methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and bacteriophages MS2, PhiX174, and Phi6, an 
enveloped RNA virus used as a surrogate for coronaviruses. Reductions of 3 log10 
on inoculated plastic bins were considered effective for decontamination.
RESULTS: UV-C light administered as 10-, 20-, or 30-second cycles in proximity 
to a plastic bin reduced contamination on each of the test sites, including 
vertical and horizontal surfaces. The 30-second cycle met criteria for 
decontamination of all 3 test sites for all the test organisms except 
bacteriophage MS2 which was reduced by greater than 2 log10 PFU at each site.
CONCLUSIONS: UV-C light is an attractive technology for rapid decontamination of 
airport security bins. Further work is needed to evaluate the utility of UV-C 
light in real-world settings and to develop methods to provide automated 
movement of bins through a UV-C decontamination process.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has 
caused a severe, international shortage of N95 respirators, which are essential 
to protect health care providers from infection. Given the contemporary 
limitations of the supply chain, it is imperative to identify effective means of 
decontaminating, reusing, and thereby conserving N95 respirator stockpiles. To 
be effective, decontamination must result in sterilization of the N95 respirator 
without impairment of respirator filtration or user fit. Although numerous 
methods of N95 decontamination exist, none are universally accessible. In this 
work, we describe a microwave-generated steam decontamination protocol for N95 
respirators for use in health care systems of all sizes, geographies, and means. 
Using widely available glass containers, mesh from commercial produce bags, a 
rubber band, and a 1,100-W commercially available microwave, we constructed an 
effective, standardized, and reproducible means of decontaminating N95 
respirators. Employing this methodology against MS2 phage, a highly conservative 
surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 contamination, we report an average 6-log10 
plaque-forming unit (PFU) (99.9999%) and a minimum 5-log10 PFU (99.999%) 
reduction after a single 3-min microwave treatment. Notably, quantified 
respirator fit and function were preserved, even after 20 sequential cycles of 
microwave steam decontamination. This method provides a valuable means of 
effective decontamination and reuse of N95 respirators by frontline providers 
facing urgent need.IMPORTANCE Due to the rapid spread of coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID-19), there is an increasing shortage of protective gear necessary to 
keep health care providers safe from infection. As of 9 April 2020, the CDC 
reported 9,282 cumulative cases of COVID-19 among U.S. health care workers (CDC 
COVID-19 Response Team, MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 69:477-481, 2020, 
https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6915e6). N95 respirators are recommended by the 
CDC as the ideal method of protection from COVID-19. Although N95 respirators 
are traditionally single use, the shortages have necessitated the need for 
reuse. Effective methods of N95 decontamination that do not affect the fit or 
filtration ability of N95 respirators are essential. Numerous methods of N95 
decontamination exist; however, none are universally accessible. In this study, 
we describe an effective, standardized, and reproducible means of 
decontaminating N95 respirators using widely available materials. The N95 
decontamination method described in this work will provide a valuable resource 
for hospitals, health care centers, and outpatient practices that are 
experiencing increasing shortages of N95 respirators due to the COVID-19 
pandemic.

A leading challenge in drinking water treatment is to remove small-sized viruses 
from the water in a simple and efficient manner. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes 
(MWCNT) are new generation adsorbents with previously demonstrated potential as 
filter media to improve virus removal. This study therefore aimed to evaluate 
the field applicability of MWCNT-filters for virus removal in water containing 
natural organic matter (NOM) as co-solute to viruses, using batch equilibrium 
experiments. Contrary to previous studies, our results showed with MS2 
bacteriophages single-solute systems that the affinity of MWCNT for MS2 was low, 
since after 3 h of equilibration only 4 log10 reduction value (LRV) of MS2 
(20 mL at an initial concentration of 106 PFU MS2/mL) were reached. Single 
solute experiments with Suwannee river NOM (SRNOM) performed with 
environmentally-relevant concentrations showed MWCNT surface saturation at 
initial SRNOM concentrations between 10 and 15 mgC/L, for water pH between 5.2 
and 8.7. These results suggested that at NOM:virus ratios found in natural 
waters, the NOM would competitively suppress virus adsorption onto MWCNT, even 
at low NOM concentrations. We confirmed this expectation with SRNOM-MS2 
co-solute experiments, which showed an exponential decrease of the MS2 LRV by 
MWCNT with an increase in the initial SRNOM concentration. More interestingly, 
we showed that pre-equilibrating MWCNT with a SRNOM solution at a concentration 
as low as 0.4 mgC/L resulted in a LRV decrease of 3 for MS2, due to the 
formation of a negatively charged SRNOM adlayer on the MWCNT surface. 
Complementary batch experiments with natural NOM-containing waters and 
competition experiments with SRNOM in the presence of CaCl2 confirmed that the 
presence of NOM in waters challenges virus removal by MWCNT-filters, 
irrespective of the concentration and type of NOM and also in the presence of 
Ca2+. We therefore conclude that MWCNT-filters produced with commercially 
available pristine MWCNT cannot be considered as a viable technology for 
drinking water virus removal.

Selection of a peptide that binds preferentially to targeted cells or tissues is 
a prerequisite for targeted therapy. Although in vivo phage display is a 
high-throughput method, it is restricted in identifying target ligands specific 
for different vascular beds. In this study, the exosomes are repurposed for 
targeting peptide screening. Briefly, the signal peptide region of Lamp2b (a 
membrane protein on the exosomes) in the N-terminus is engineered to fuse with 
10 aa long random peptides, while the C-terminus of Lamp2b is fused with the MS2 
coating protein (MCP). Then, the whole Lamp2b-MCP open reading frame (ORF) is 
further engineered to harbor a 3'UTR sequence consisting of MS2. The resultant 
exosomes from engineered Lamp2b-MCP expressing cells display the 10 aa peptides 
on the outside while containing the genetic information inside. By 
proof-of-principle experiments, the exosomes with different peptides could 
preferentially distribute to different tissues besides the spleen and liver. 
Furthermore, detailed target sequences for different tissues are enriched by 
rounds of selection. In summary, the established novel targeted peptide 
screening strategy, namely, "exosome display," has broad applicability, 
especially for displaying and screening targeted peptides for the cells outside 
the capillary with condense barriers, like the neurons in the brain.

Site-directed RNA editing (SDRE) technologies have great potential for treating 
genetic diseases caused by point mutations. Our group and other researchers have 
developed SDRE methods utilizing adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) and 
guide RNAs recruiting ADARs to target RNAs bearing point mutations. In general, 
efficient SDRE relies on introducing numerous guide RNAs relative to target 
genes. However, achieving a large ratio is not possible for gene therapy 
applications. In order to achieve a realistic ratio, we herein developed a 
system that can introduce an equal number of genes and guide RNAs into cultured 
cells using a fusion protein comprising an ADAR fragment and a plasmid vector 
containing one copy of each gene on a single construct. We transfected the 
single construct into HEK293T cells and achieved relatively high efficiency (up 
to 42%). The results demonstrate that efficient SDRE is possible when the copy 
number is similar for all three factors (target gene, guide RNA, and ADAR 
enzyme). This method is expected to be capable of highly efficient gene repair 
in vivo, making it applicable for gene therapy.

Viruses are infections species that infect a large spectrum of living systems. 
Although displaying a wide variety of shapes and sizes, they are all composed of 
nucleic acid encapsulated into a protein capsid. After virions enter the host 
cell, they replicate to produce multiple copies of themselves. They then lyse 
the host, releasing virions to infect new cells. The high proliferation rate of 
viruses is the underlying cause of their fast transmission among living species. 
Although many viruses are harmless, some of them are responsible for severe 
diseases such as AIDS, viral hepatitis, and flu. Traditionally, electron 
microscopy is used to identify and characterize viruses. This approach is time- 
and labor-consuming, which is problematic upon pandemic proliferation of 
previously unknown viruses, such as H1N1 and COVID-19. Herein, we demonstrate a 
novel diagnosis approach for label-free identification and structural 
characterization of individual viruses that is based on a combination of 
nanoscale Raman and infrared spectroscopy. Using atomic force 
microscopy-infrared (AFM-IR) spectroscopy, we were able to probe structural 
organization of the virions of Herpes Simplex Type 1 viruses and bacteriophage 
MS2. We also showed that tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) could be used to 
reveal protein secondary structure and amino acid composition of the virus 
surface. Our results show that AFM-IR and TERS provide different but 
complementary information about the structure of complex biological specimens. 
This structural information can be used for fast and reliable identification of 
viruses. This nanoscale bimodal imaging approach can be also used to investigate 
the origin of viral polymorphism and study mechanisms of virion assembly.

Femtosecond (fs) laser irradiation techniques are emerging tools for 
inactivating viruses that do not involve ionizing radiation. In this work, the 
inactivation of two bacteriophages representing protective capsids with 
different geometric constraints, that is, the near-spherical MS2 (with a 
diameter of 27 nm) and the filamentous M13 (with a length of 880 nm) is compared 
using energetic visible and near-infrared fs laser pulses with various energies, 
pulse durations, and exposure times. Intriguingly, the results show that 
inactivation using 400 nm lasers is substantially more efficient for MS2 
compared to M13. In contrast, using 800 nm lasers, M13 was slightly more 
efficiently inactivated. For both viruses, the genome was exposed to a harmful 
environment upon fs-laser irradiation. However, in addition to the protection of 
the genome, the metastable capsids differ in many properties required for 
stepwise cell entry that may explain their dissimilar behavior after (partial) 
disassembly. For MS2, the dominant mechanism of fs-laser inactivation was the 
aggregation of the viral capsid proteins, whereas aggregation did not affect M13 
inactivation, suggesting that the dominant mechanism of M13 inactivation was 
related to breaking of secondary protein links.

Pathogenic enteric viruses and bacteria tend to occur in higher concentrations 
and survive longer in aquatic sediments than suspended in the water column. 
Re-suspension of these organisms can result in a significant degradation of 
overlying water quality. Additionally, the re-suspension of microbial pathogens 
in artificial irrigation canals could endanger the consumption of fresh and 
ready-to-eat produce. Irrigation water has been implicated in numerous fresh 
produce outbreaks over the last 30 years. This study aimed to quantify the 
proportions of bacterial and viral re-suspension from sediment in a 
recirculating flume with varying velocities. MS2 coliphage and Escherichia coli 
were found to re-suspend at rates that were not significantly different, despite 
organism size differences. However, E. coli re-suspension rates from sand and 
clay were significantly different. This suggests that likely sediment-associated 
particles were recovered with the organisms attached. Similar re-suspension 
rates are hypothesized to be due to the dynamics of sediment transport, rather 
than that of the organisms themselves. This study also indicated that the 
re-suspension of sediment at very low velocities (e.g., less than 10 cm/s), 
could impact the microbiological quality of the overlaying water. Results from 
this study conclude that sediment could be a viable mechanism for irrigation 
water contamination.

RNA transport and localization are evolutionarily conserved processes that allow 
protein translation to occur at specific subcellular sites and thereby having 
fundamental roles in the determination of cell fates, embryonic patterning, 
asymmetric cell division, and cell polarity. In addition to localizing RNA 
molecules to specific subcellular sites, plants have the ability to exchange RNA 
molecules between cells through plasmodesmata (PD). Plant RNA viruses hijack the 
mechanisms of intracellular and intercellular RNA transport to establish 
localized replication centers within infected cells and then to disseminate 
their infectious genomes between cells and throughout the plant organism with 
the help of their movement proteins (MP). In this chapter, we describe the 
transient expression of the tobacco mosaic virus movement protein (TMV-MP) and 
the application of the MS2 system for the in vivo labeling of the MP-encoding 
mRNA. The MS2 method is based on the binding of the bacteriophage coat protein 
(CP) to its origin of assembly (OAS) in the phage RNA. Thus, to label a specific 
mRNA in vivo, a tandem repetition of a 19-nucleotide-long stem-loop 
(SL) sequence derived from the MS2 OAS sequence (MSL) is transcriptionally fused 
to the RNA under investigation. The RNA is detected by the co-expression of 
fluorescent protein-tagged MS2 CP (MCP), which binds to each of the MSL 
elements. In providing a detailed protocol for the in vivo visualization of 
TMV-MP mRNA tagged with the MS2 system in Nicotiana benthamiana epidermal cells, 
we describe (1) the specific DNA constructs, (2) Agrobacterium 
tumefaciens-mediated transfection for their transient expression in plants, and 
(3) imaging conditions required to obtain high-quality mRNA imaging data.

Live imaging of single RNA from birth to death brought important advances in our 
understanding of the spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression. These studies 
have provided a comprehensive understanding of RNA metabolism by describing the 
process step by step. Most of these studies used for live imaging a genetically 
encoded RNA-tagging system fused to fluorescent proteins. One of the best 
characterized RNA-tagging systems is derived from the bacteriophage MS2 and it 
allows single RNA imaging in real-time and live cells. This system has been 
successfully used to track the different steps of mRNA processing in many living 
organisms. The recent development of optimized MS2 and MCP variants now allows 
the labeling of endogenous RNAs and their imaging without modifying their 
behavior. In this chapter, we discuss the improvements in detecting single mRNAs 
with different variants of MCP and fluorescent proteins that we tested in yeast 
and mammalian cells. Moreover, we describe protocols using MS2-MCP systems 
improved for real-time imaging of single mRNAs and transcription dynamics in S. 
cerevisiae and mammalian cells, respectively.

Multicellular organisms rely on systemic signals to orchestrate diverse 
developmental and physiological programs. To transmit environmental stimuli that 
perceived in the leaves, plants recruit many mobile molecules including mobile 
mRNAs as systemic signals for interorgan communication. The mobile mRNAs provide 
an efficient and specific remote control system for plants to cope with 
environmental dynamics. Upon being transcribed in local tissues, mobile mRNAs 
are selectively targeted to plasmodesmata for cell-to-cell and long-distance 
translocation. The mRNA labeling system based on the RNA-binding protein MS2 
provides a useful tool to investigate intracellular trafficking of mobile mRNAs 
in plants. Here we describe the detailed protocol to visualize intracellular 
trafficking of plant mobile mRNAs by using the MS2 live-cell imaging system.

Intercellular communication is a major hallmark of multicellular organisms and 
is responsible for coordinating cell and tissue differentiation, immune 
responses, synaptic transmission, and both paracrine and endocrine signaling, 
for example. Small molecules, peptides, and proteins have all been studied 
extensively as mediators of intercellular communication; however, RNAs have also 
been shown recently to transfer between cells. In mammalian cells, microRNAs, 
tRNAs, short noncoding RNAs, mRNA fragments, as well as full-length mRNAs have 
all been shown to transfer between cells either by exosomes or by membrane 
nanotubes. We have previously described nanotube-mediated cell-cell transfer of 
specific mRNAs between heterologous mammalian cell types cultured in vitro. 
Here, we describe a simple method for the unbiased and quantitative 
identification of the complete range of transferred mRNAs (i.e., the mRNA 
transferome) in one population of mammalian cells following co-culture with 
another population. After co-culture, the individual cell populations are sorted 
by magnetic bead-mediated cell sorting and the transferred RNAs are then 
identified by downstream analysis methods, such as RNA sequencing. Application 
of this technique not only allows for determination of the mRNA transferome, but 
can also reveal changes in the native transcriptome of a cell population after 
co-culture. This can indicate the effect that co-culture and intercellular 
transfer of mRNA have upon cell physiology.

Ribonucleic acids (RNAs) play essential roles in living cells. Many of them fold 
into defined three-dimensional (3D) structures to perform functions. Recent 
advances in single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have enabled 
structure determinations of RNA to atomic resolutions. However, most RNA 
molecules are structurally flexible, limiting the resolution of their structures 
solved by cryo-EM. In modeling these molecules, several computational methods 
are limited by the requirement of massive computational resources and/or the low 
efficiency in exploring large-scale structural variations. Here we use 
hierarchical natural move Monte Carlo (HNMMC), which takes advantage of 
collective motions for groups of nucleic acid residues, to refine RNA structures 
into their cryo-EM maps, preserving atomic details in the models. After 
validating the method on a simulated density map of tRNA, we applied it to 
objectively obtain the model of the folding intermediate for the specificity 
domain of ribonuclease P from Bacillus subtilis and refine a flexible ribosomal 
RNA (rRNA) expansion segment from the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) ribosome 
in different conformational states. Finally, we used HNMMC to model atomic 
details and flexibility for two distinct conformations of the complete genomic

Single-stranded RNA bacteriophages (ssRNA phages) are small spherical RNA 
viruses that infect bacteria with retractile pili. The single positive-sense 
genomic RNA of ssRNA phages, which is protected by a capsid shell, is delivered 
into the host via the retraction of the host pili. Structures involved in ssRNA 
phage infection cycle are essential for understanding the underlying mechanisms 
that can be used to engineer them for therapeutic applications. This review 
summarizes the recent breakthroughs in high-resolution structural studies of two 
ssRNA phages, MS2 and Qβ, and their interaction with the host, E. coli, by 
cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). These studies revealed new cryo-EM 
structures, which provide insights into how MS2 and Qβ package the RNA, lyse 
E. coli, and adsorb to the receptor F-pili, responsible for conjugation. 
Methodologies described here can be expanded to study other ssRNA phages that 
target pathogenic bacteria.

    Clin Chem. 2020 Sep 1;66(9):1128-1130.

BACKGROUND: Every clinical specimen is potentially infectious, but data 
regarding risk for contamination of the laboratory environment during routine 
testing are scarce. We assessed contamination during routine sample analysis in 
automated clinical chemistry and microbiology laboratories.
METHODS: A fluorescent marker was applied to specimen container exteriors to 
assess the impact of gross contamination. Nonpathogenic MS2 virus was added to 
remnant blood, urine, and ESwab matrices as a biomarker of cross-contamination. 
Samples were processed and analyzed using Roche Cobas 8100 and ISE, c502, e602, 
and c702 modules (blood) and BD Kiestra total laboratory automation (blood, 
urine, ESwabs) over 3 experiments. Fluorescence transfer to laboratory surfaces 
and personnel was visualized using ultraviolet light. Surfaces were swabbed and 
assessed for MS2 cross-contamination by RT-PCR. Adherence to standard 
precautions by laboratory staff was assessed by observation.
RESULTS: Fluorescence was observed on 49 of 165 (30%) laboratory surfaces and 
personnel and 21 of 93 (23%) total laboratory automation instruments. 
Fluorescence transferred most frequently to gloves (31/40), computer accessories 
(9/18), and specimen loading racks (12/12). None of 123 areas swabbed were 
positive for MS2. Improper personal protective equipment use occurred at a rate 
of 0.36 and 0.15 events per staff per hour in the chemistry and microbiology 
laboratories, respectively. Hand-washing compliance was observed for 61 of 132 
(46%) staff members evaluated.
CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of grossly contaminated specimens on automated chemistry 
and microbiology equipment elicits a low likelihood of instrument contamination. 
However, handling contaminated specimen containers can result in contamination 
of environmental laboratory surfaces, representing a source of risk that is 
heightened by low adherence to appropriate personal protective equipment.

HYPOTHESIS: Drying-induced decrease in lip balm surface energy enhances virus 
adhesion due to the emergence of strong hydrophobic colloid-surface 
interactions.
EXPERIMENTS: A protocol was developed for preparing lip balm coatings to enable 
physicochemical characterization and adhesion studies. Surface charge and 
hydrophobicity of four brands of lip balm (dry and hydrated) and human 
adenovirus 5 (HAdV5) were measured and used to calculate the extended 
Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (XDLVO) energy of interactions between lip balm 
coatings and HAdV5 as well as four other colloids: HAdV40, MS2 and P22 
bacteriophages, and SiO2. Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation 
monitoring (QCM-D) tests employed SiO2 colloids, HAdV5 and hydrated lip balms.
FINDINGS: Drying of lip balms results in a dramatic decrease of their surface 
energy (δΔGsws≥ 83.0 mJ/m2) making the surfaces highly hydrophobic. For dry lip 
balms, the interaction of the balm surface with all five colloids is attractive. 
For lip balms hydrated in 150 mM NaCl (ionic strength of human saliva), XDLVO 
calculations predict that hydrophilic colloids (MS2, P22, SiO2) may attach into 
shallow secondary minima. Due to the relative hydrophobicity of human 
adenoviruses, primary maxima in XDLVO profiles are low or non-existent making 
irreversible deposition into primary energy minima possible. Preliminary QCM-D 
tests with SiO2 colloids and HAdV5 confirm deposition on hydrated lip balms.

Despite the threat to human health posed by some single-stranded RNA viruses, 
little is understood about their assembly. The goal of this work is to introduce 
a new tool for watching an RNA genome direct its own packaging and encapsidation 
by proteins. Contrast variation small-angle X-ray scattering (CV-SAXS) is a 
powerful tool with the potential to monitor the changing structure of a viral 
RNA through this assembly process. The proteins, though present, do not 
contribute to the measured signal. As a first step in assessing the feasibility 
of viral genome studies, the structure of encapsidated MS2 RNA was exclusively 
detected with CV-SAXS and compared with a structure derived from asymmetric 
cryo-EM reconstructions. Additional comparisons with free RNA highlight the 
significant structural rearrangements induced by capsid proteins and invite the 
application of time-resolved CV-SAXS to reveal interactions that result in 
efficient viral assembly.

One promising strategy to combat antimicrobial resistance is to use 
bacteriophages that attach to the sex pili produced by transmissible 
antimicrobial resistance (AMR) plasmids, infect AMR bacteria and select for loss 
of the AMR plasmids, prolonging the life of existing antimicrobials. The 
maturation protein of the bacteriophage MS2 attaches to the pili produced by 
Incompatibility group F plasmid-containing bacteria. This interaction initiates 
delivery of the viral genetic material into the bacteria. Using protein-protein 
docking we constructed a model of the F pilus comprising a trimer of subunits 
binding to the maturation protein. Interactions between the maturation protein 
and the F pilus were investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. In 
silico alanine scanning and in silico single-point mutations were explored, with 
the longer term aim of increasing the affinity of the maturation protein to 
other Incompatibility group pili, without reducing the strength of binding to F 
pilin. We report our computational findings on which residues are required for 
the maturation protein and F pilin to interact, those which had no effect on the 
interaction and the mutations which led to a stronger interaction.

Cheater viruses, also known as defective interfering viruses, cannot replicate 
on their own yet replicate faster than the wild type upon coinfection. While 
there is growing interest in using cheaters as antiviral therapeutics, the 
mechanisms underlying cheating have been rarely explored. During experimental 
evolution of MS2 phage, we observed the parallel emergence of two independent 
cheater mutants. The first, a point deletion mutant, lacked polymerase activity 
but was advantageous in viral packaging. The second synonymous mutant cheater 
displayed a completely different cheating mechanism, involving an altered RNA 
structure. Continued evolution revealed the demise of the deletion cheater and 
rise of the synonymous cheater. A mathematical model inferred that while a 
single cheater is expected to reach an equilibrium with the wild type, cheater 
demise arises from antagonistic interactions between coinfecting cheaters. These 
findings highlight layers of parasitism: viruses parasitizing cells, cheaters 
parasitizing intact viruses, and cheaters may parasitize other cheaters.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become pandemic since March 11, 2020. 
Thus, development and integration in clinics of fast and sensitive diagnostic 
tools are essential. The aim of the study is a development and evaluation of a 
one-step quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) 
assay (COVID-19 Amp) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) detection with an armored positive control and internal controls 
constructed from synthetic MS2-phage-based RNA particles. The COVID-19 Amp assay 
limit of detection was 103  copies/ml, the analytical specificity was 100%. A 
total of 109 biological samples were examined using COVID-19 Amp and World 
Health Organization (WHO)-based assay. Discordance in nine samples was observed 
(negative by the WHO-based assay) and discordant samples were retested as 
positive according to the results obtained from the Vector-PCRrv-2019-nCoV-RG 
assay. The developed COVID-19 Amp assay has high sensitivity and specificity, 
includes virus particles-based controls, provides the direct definition of the 
SARS-CoV-2 RdRp gene partial sequence, and is suitable for any hospital and 
laboratory equipped for RT-qPCR.

Although the F-specific ssRNA phage MS2 has long had paradigm status, little is 
known about penetration of the genomic RNA (gRNA) into the cell. The phage 
initially binds to the F-pilus using its maturation protein (Mat), and then the 
Mat-bound gRNA is released from the viral capsid and somehow crosses the 
bacterial envelope into the cytoplasm. To address the mechanics of this process, 
we fluorescently labeled the ssRNA phage MS2 to track F-pilus dynamics during 
infection. We discovered that ssRNA phage infection triggers the release of 
F-pili from host cells, and that higher multiplicity of infection (MOI) 
correlates with detachment of longer F-pili. We also report that entry of gRNA 
into the host cytoplasm requires the F-plasmid-encoded coupling protein, TraD, 
which is located at the cytoplasmic entrance of the F-encoded type IV secretion 
system (T4SS). However, TraD is not essential for pilus detachment, indicating 
that detachment is triggered by an early step of MS2 engagement with the F-pilus 
or T4SS. We propose a multistep model in which the ssRNA phage binds to the 
F-pilus and through pilus retraction engages with the distal end of the T4SS 
channel at the cell surface. Continued pilus retraction pulls the Mat-gRNA 
complex out of the virion into the T4SS channel, causing a torsional stress that 
breaks the mature F-pilus at the cell surface. We propose that phage-induced 
disruptions of F-pilus dynamics provides a selective advantage for infecting 
phages and thus may be prevalent among the phages specific for retractile pili.

The bottom-up construction of biological entities from genetic information 
provides a broad range of opportunities to better understand fundamental 
processes within living cells, as well as holding great promise for the 
development of novel biomedical applications. Cell-free 
transcription-translation (TXTL) systems have become suitable platforms to 
tackle such topics because they recapitulate the process of gene expression. 
TXTL systems have advanced to where the in vitro construction of viable, 
complex, self-assembling deoxyribonucleic acid-programmed biological entities is 
now possible. Previously, we demonstrated the cell-free synthesis of three 
bacteriophages from their genomes: MS2, ΦX174, T7. In this work, we present the 
complete synthesis of the phage T4 from its 169-kbp genome in one-pot TXTL 
reactions. This achievement, for one of the largest coliphages, demonstrates the 
integration of complex gene regulation, metabolism and self-assembly, and brings 
the bottom-up synthesis of biological systems to a new level.

Identifying the specific epitopes targeted by antibodies elicited in response to 
infectious diseases is important for developing vaccines and diagnostics. 
However, techniques for broadly exploring the specificity of antibodies in a 
rapid manner are lacking, limiting our ability to quickly respond to emerging 
viruses. We previously reported a technology that couples deep sequencing 
technology with a bacteriophage MS2 virus-like particle (VLP) peptide display 
platform for identifying pathogen-specific antibody responses. Here, we describe 
refinements that expand the number of patient samples that can be processed at 
one time, increasing the utility of this technology for rapidly responding to 
emerging infectious diseases. We used dengue virus (DENV) as a model system 
since much is already known about the antibody response. Sera from primary 
DENV-infected patients (n = 28) were used to pan an MS2 bacteriophage VLP 
library displaying all possible 10-amino-acid peptides from the DENV 
polypeptide. Selected VLPs were identified by deep sequencing and further 
investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We identified previously 
described immunodominant regions of envelope and nonstructural protein-1, as 
well as a number of other epitopes. Our refinement of the deep sequence-coupled 
biopanning technology expands the utility of this approach for rapidly 
investigating the specificity of antibody responses to infectious diseases.

AIMS: The efficacy of a novel photochemical method for generating chlorine 
dioxide (photoClO2 ) was evaluated against human noroviruses (HuNoV) surrogate, 
bacteriophage MS2, and Clostridium difficile endospores.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Chlorine dioxide was generated by mixing 1% sodium chlorite 
with 10 parts-per-million (ppm) Eosin Y and irradiating with a 
photo-activator-excitable light. PhotoClO2 efficacy was assessed against 
bacteriophage MS2 and C. difficile endospores in suspension, on hard surfaces 
and greenhouse conditions under soiled and unsoiled conditions. The estimated 
effective photoClO2 produced and consumed was 20·39 ± 0·16 ppm at a rate of 
8·16 ppm per min in a 1% sodium chlorite solution. In suspension, MS2 phage was 
reduced by 3·35 and >5·10 log10 PFU per ml in 120 and 90 min, with and without 
soil, respectively. At the same time, when dried on stainless steel surface, MS2 
phage was reduced by >4·53 log10 PFU per carrier in 30 min under both 
conditions. On the other hand, C. difficile endospores in suspension were 
reduced by 2·26 and 3·65 log10 CFU per ml in 120 min with and without soiling, 
respectively. However, on stainless steel surface, maximal reductions of the C. 
difficile endospores were 0·8 and 1·5 log10 CFU per carrier with and without 
soiling, respectively, and a maximal reduction of 2·97 log10 CFU per carrier 
under greenhouse conditions at 24 h.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, photoClO2 showed promise as a technology to control HuNoV 
contamination on environmental surfaces but requires further optimization and 
testing against C. difficile endospores.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Results from this investigation will serve 
as a model for how to generate and quantify photoClO2 and how to appropriately 
evaluate this new class of disinfectants against environmentally resilient 
pathogens: viruses and bacterial endospores.

BACKGROUND: Critical shortages of personal protective equipment, especially N95 
respirators, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues 
to be a source of concern. Novel methods of N95 filtering face-piece respirator 
decontamination that can be scaled-up for in-hospital use can help address this 
concern and keep healthcare workers (HCWs) safe.
METHODS: A multidisciplinary pragmatic study was conducted to evaluate the use 
of an ultrasonic room high-level disinfection system (HLDS) that generates 
aerosolized peracetic acid (PAA) and hydrogen peroxide for decontamination of 
large numbers of N95 respirators. A cycle duration that consistently achieved 
disinfection of N95 respirators (defined as ≥6 log10 reductions in bacteriophage 
MS2 and Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores inoculated onto respirators) was 
identified. The treated masks were assessed for changes to their hydrophobicity, 
material structure, strap elasticity, and filtration efficiency. PAA and 
hydrogen peroxide off-gassing from treated masks were also assessed.
RESULTS: The PAA room HLDS was effective for disinfection of bacteriophage MS2 
and G. stearothermophilus spores on respirators in a 2,447 cubic-foot (69.6 
cubic-meter) room with an aerosol deployment time of 16 minutes and a dwell time 
of 32 minutes. The total cycle time was 1 hour and 16 minutes. After 5 treatment 
cycles, no adverse effects were detected on filtration efficiency, structural 
integrity, or strap elasticity. There was no detectable off-gassing of PAA and 
hydrogen peroxide from the treated masks at 20 and 60 minutes after the 
disinfection cycle, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The PAA room disinfection system provides a rapidly scalable 
solution for in-hospital decontamination of large numbers of N95 respirators 
during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Open defecation remains a common practice in developing countries and leads to 
high incidence and prevalence of acute gastroenteritis, which is most often 
caused by human noroviruses (human NoV). Encouraging the use of toilets and pit 
latrines is one method of improving sanitation; however, it is often hindered by 
not only cultural traditions but also from a reluctance to use latrines and 
toilets due to their odor and impression of uncleanliness. In an effort to 
establish new means to encourage toilet and latrine use, laboratory experiments 
tested the ability of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) to modify the malodorous 
compounds identified in the air in latrines in developing countries (indole, 
p-cresol, dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS), and butyric 
acid) and inactivate MS2 bacteriophage, a surrogate for human NoV. After 5 
minutes, > 94% of indole, p-cresol, DMDS, and DMTS was modified as determined by 
high-pressure liquid chromatography in the presence of 100 ppm HOCl. A log10 
reduction value (LRV) greater than 6 was seen for MS2 bacteriophage after 5 
minutes of exposure to 100 ppm HOCl in solution. Sensory studies indicated that 
there was a significant difference (P ≤ 0.05) between the untreated and 
HOCl-treated samples for all five malodorous compounds tested. The findings 
suggest that introduction of HOCl into the headspace air could encourage latrine 
and toilet use. Optimization of HOCl dosing in air to accomplish both odor 
control and reduction of infectious hazards is worthy of further study.

The small lytic phages (Microviridae and Leviviridae), effect bacterial lysis 
with the product of a single gene. The three well-studied single-gene lysis 
(Sgl) proteins (E of φX174, A2 of Qβ, and LysM of phage M) lack direct muralytic 
activity, and have been shown to function as 'protein antibiotics' by acting as 
noncompetitive inhibitors of conserved peptidoglycan (PG) biosynthesis enzymes, 
MurA, MraY, and MurJ respectively. The fourth, protein L of MS2, does not 
inhibit PG biosynthesis but instead is hypothesized to trigger host autolytic 
response through an unknown mechanism. Recent advances in meta-omics approaches 
have led to an explosion in the available genomes of small lytic phages. Of the 
thousands of new genomes, only one annotated Sgl shared some sequence similarity 
with a known Sgl (L of MS2), highlighting the diversity in Sgls. The newly 
available genomic space serves as an untapped resource for discovering novel 
Sgls.

Supply shortages of N95 respirators during the coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) pandemic have motivated institutions to develop feasible and 
effective N95 respirator reuse strategies. In particular, heat decontamination 
is a treatment method that scales well and can be implemented in settings with 
variable or limited resources. Prior studies using multiple inactivation 
methods, however, have often focused on a single virus under narrowly defined 
conditions, making it difficult to develop guiding principles for inactivating 
emerging or difficult-to-culture viruses. We systematically explored how 
temperature, humidity, and virus deposition solutions impact the inactivation of 
viruses deposited and dried on N95 respirator coupons. We exposed four virus 
surrogates across a range of structures and phylogenies, including two 
bacteriophages (MS2 and phi6), a mouse coronavirus (murine hepatitis virus 
[MHV]), and a recombinant human influenza A virus subtype H3N2 (IAV), to heat 
treatment for 30 min in multiple deposition solutions across several 
temperatures and relative humidities (RHs). We observed that elevated RH was 
essential for effective heat inactivation of all four viruses tested. For heat 
treatments between 72°C and 82°C, RHs greater than 50% resulted in a >6-log10 
inactivation of bacteriophages, and RHs greater than 25% resulted in a 
>3.5-log10 inactivation of MHV and IAV. Furthermore, deposition of viruses in 
host cell culture media greatly enhanced virus inactivation by heat and humidity 
compared to other deposition solutions, such as phosphate-buffered saline, 
phosphate-buffered saline with bovine serum albumin, and human saliva. Past and 
future heat treatment methods must therefore explicitly account for deposition 
solutions as a factor that will strongly influence observed virus inactivation 
rates. Overall, our data set can inform the design and validation of effective 
heat-based decontamination strategies for N95 respirators and other porous 
surfaces, especially for emerging viruses that may be of immediate and future 
public health concern.IMPORTANCE Shortages of personal protective equipment, 
including N95 respirators, during the coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
pandemic have highlighted the need to develop effective decontamination 
strategies for their reuse. This is particularly important in health care 
settings for reducing exposure to respiratory viruses, like severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19. 
Although several treatment methods are available, a widely accessible strategy 
will be necessary to combat shortages on a global scale. We demonstrate that the 
combination of heat and humidity inactivates a range of RNA viruses, including 
both viral pathogens and common viral pathogen surrogates, after deposition on 
N95 respirators and achieves the necessary virus inactivation detailed by the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines to validate N95 respirator 
decontamination technologies. We further demonstrate that depositing viruses 
onto surfaces when suspended in culture media can greatly enhance observed 
inactivation, adding caution to how heat and humidity treatment methods are 
validated.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a huge threat 
to public health. Viral nucleic acid testing is the diagnostic gold standard and 
can play an important role in the prevention and control of this infection. In 
this study, bacteriophage MS2 virus-like particles encapsulating specific RNA 
sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses were prepared by genetic 
engineering. The assessment panel, consisting of four positive samples with 
concentrations of 2.8, 3.5, 4.2, and 4.9 log10 copies/mL and five negative 
samples with other human coronaviruses, was prepared and distributed to evaluate 
the accuracy of routine viral RNA detection. Results of 931 panels from 844 
laboratories were collected. The overall percentage agreement, positive 
percentage agreement (PPA), and negative percentage agreement, defined as the 
percentage of agreement between the correct results and total results submitted 
for all, positive, and negative samples were 96.8% (8109/8379), 93.9% 
(3497/3724), and 99.1% (4612/4655), respectively. For samples with 
concentrations of 4.9 and 4.2 log10 copies/mL, the PPAs were >95%. However, for 
3.5 and 2.8 log10 copies/mL, the PPAs were 94.6% (881/931) and 84.9% (790/931), 
respectively. For all negative samples, the negative percentage agreement values 
were >95%. Thus, most laboratories can reliably detect SARS-CoV-2. However, 
further improvement and optimization are required to ensure the accuracy of 
detection in panel members with lower concentrations of viral RNA.

The primary concentration and molecular process are critical to implement 
wastewater-based epidemiology for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, the previously developed methods were optimized for 
nonenveloped viruses. Few studies evaluated if the methods are applicable to the 
efficient recovery of enveloped viruses from various types of raw sewage. This 
study aims (1) to compare the whole process recovery of Pseudomonas phage φ6, a 
surrogate for enveloped viruses, among combinations of primary concentration 
[ultrafiltration (UF), electronegative membrane vortex (EMV), and polyethylene 
glycol precipitation (PEG)] and RNA extraction methods (spin column-based method 
using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit and acid guanidinium 
thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction using TRIzol reagent) for three types 
of raw sewage and (2) to test the applicability of the method providing the 
highest φ6 recovery to the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Among the tested 
combinations, PEG+TRIzol provided the highest φ6 recovery ratio of 29.8% to 
49.8% (geometric mean). UF + QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit provided the second 
highest φ6 recovery of 6.4% to 35.8%. The comparable φ6 recovery was observed 
for UF + TRIzol (13.8-30.0%). PEG + QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit provided only 1.4% 
to 3.0% of φ6 recovery, while coliphage MS2, a surrogate for nonenveloped 
viruses, was recovered comparably with PEG + TRIzol. This indicated that the 
nonenveloped surrogate (MS2) did not necessarily validate the efficient recovery 
for enveloped viruses. EMV + QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit provided significantly 
different φ6 recovery (1.6-21%) among the types of raw sewage. Then, the 
applicability of modified PEG + TRIzol was examined for the raw sewage collected 
in Tokyo, Japan. Of the 12 grab samples, 4 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 CDC N1 
and N3 assay. Consequently, PEG + TRIzol provided the highest φ6 recovery and 
allowed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from raw sewage.

PP7 is a leviphage, with a single-stranded RNA genome, that infects Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa PAO1. A reverse genetic system for PP7 was previously created by 
using reverse-transcribed cDNA (PP7O) from a virion-derived RNA genome. Here, we 
have found that the PP7O cDNA contained 20 nucleotide differences from the PP7 
genome sequence deposited in the database. We created another reverse genetic 
system exploiting chemically synthesized cDNA (PP7S) based on the database 
sequence. Unlike PP7O, which yielded infectious PP7 virions, PP7S-derived 
particles were incapable of plaque formation on PAO1 cells, which was restored 
in the PAO1 cells expressing the maturation protein (MP) from PP7O Using this 
reverse genetic system, we revealed two amino acid residues involved in the 
known roles of MP (i.e., adsorption and genome replication), fortuitously 
providing a lesson that the viral RNA genome sequencing needs functional 
verification, possibly by a reverse genetic system.IMPORTANCE The biological 
significance of RNA phages has been largely ignored, ironically, because few 
studies have focused on RNA phages. As an initial attempt to properly represent 
RNA phages in the phageome, we previously created, by using reverse-transcribed 
cDNA, a reverse genetic system for the small RNA phage PP7, which infects the 
opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa We report another system by 
using chemically synthesized cDNA based on the database genome that has 20 
nucleotide differences from the previous cDNA. Investigation of those 
cDNA-derived phage virions revealed that two amino acids of the maturation 
protein are crucial for the normal phage lifecycle at different steps. Our study 
provides insight into the molecular basis for the RNA phage lifecycle and a 
lesson that the RNA genome sequencing needs to be carefully validated by 
cDNA-based phage assembly systems.

The First Australians had well-developed healing systems. Groote Eylandt 
inhabitants used a variety of plant species to treat diarrhoea and other 
gastrointestinal illnesses. This study was undertaken to test, identify, and 
evaluate traditional medicines to treat these conditions against 
gastrointestinal bacterial, protozoal, and viral pathogens, as well as against 
cancer cell proliferation. Six plant species (Buchanania obovata Engl., 
Casuarina equisetifolia L., Eucalyptus tetrodonta F. Muell., Planchonia careya 
(F. Muell.) R. Knuth, Terminalia carpentariae C. T. White, and Vigna vexillata 
(L.) A. Rich.) were selected from a survey of a panel of elders from the 
Warnindhilyagwa tribe and compared with the published literature. Decoctions 
prepared according to traditional methods were screened for growth inhibitory 
activity of a panel of diarrhoea-causing bacterial pathogens by disc diffusion 
and liquid dilution MIC assays. Inhibitory activity against the gastrointestinal 
protozoal parasite Giardia duodenalis and antiproliferative activity against 
human colorectal (Caco2) and cervical (HeLa) cancer cell lines were evaluated 
using MTS-based colorimetric cell proliferation assays. Preliminary antiviral 
screening was accomplished using an MS2 bacteriophage plaque reduction assay. 
Toxicity was evaluated using Artemia franciscana nauplii mortality and HDF cell 
viability bioassays. All traditional medicines tested inhibited bacterial 
growth, often with MIC values substantially <1000 μg/mL. T. carpentariae was 
particularly noteworthy, with MIC values of 230-350 μg/mL against Citrobacter 
freundii, Salmonella newport, Shigella sonnei, Staphylococcus aureus, and 
Staphylococcus epidermidis. This species also had MICs 450-950 μg/mL against all 
other bacterial pathogens. B. obovata Engl. and E. tetrodonta were also good 
inhibitors of bacterial growth, albeit with substantially higher MIC values than 
determined for T. carpentariae. The T. carpentariae decoction was also the best 
inhibitor of MS2 phage replication (IC50 = 427 μg/mL) and Caco2 and HeLa 
proliferation (IC50 values of 885 and 85 μg/mL, respectively). None of the 
extracts were particularly strong inhibitors of Giardia duodenalis growth. All 
decoctions were nontoxic in the Artemia nauplii and HDF cell viability 
bioassays, indicating their suitability for therapeutic use.

Survival of MS2 and Φ6 viruses in droplets as a function of relative humidity, 
pH, and salt, protein, and surfactant concentrations.

The survival of viruses in droplets is known to depend on droplets' chemical 
composition, which may vary in respiratory fluid between individuals and over 
the course of disease. This relationship is also important for understanding the 
persistence of viruses in droplets generated from wastewater, freshwater, and 
seawater. We investigated the effects of salt (0, 1, and 35 g/L), protein (0, 
100, and 1000 μg/mL), surfactant (0, 1, and 10 μg/mL), and droplet pH (4.0, 7.0, 
and 10.0) on the viability of viruses in 1-μL droplets pipetted onto polystyrene 
surfaces and exposed to 20%, 50%, and 80% relative humidity (RH) using a 
culture-based approach. Results showed that viability of MS2, a non-enveloped 
virus, was generally higher than that of Φ6, an enveloped virus, in droplets 
after 1 hour. The chemical composition of droplets greatly influenced virus 
viability. Specifically, the survival of MS2 was similar in droplets at 
different pH values, but the viability of Φ6 was significantly reduced in acidic 
and basic droplets compared to neutral ones. The presence of bovine serum 
albumin protected both MS2 and Φ6 from inactivation in droplets. The effects of 
sodium chloride and the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate varied by virus type 
and RH. Meanwhile, RH affected the viability of viruses as shown previously: 
viability was lowest at intermediate to high RH. The results demonstrate that 
the viability of viruses is determined by the chemical composition of carrier 
droplets, especially pH and protein content, and environmental factors. These 
findings emphasize the importance of understanding the chemical composition of 
carrier droplets in order to predict the persistence of viruses contained in 
them.

The inactivation of bacteriophage MS2 by sodium hypochlorite was investigated to 
understand the effect of solution chemistry on the disinfection efficacy in the 
presence of particles. Kaolinite and Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa) were 
used as the models of inorganic and organic particles to simulate high turbidity 
and algal cells, respectively, in drinking water sources. In both 
particle-containing solutions, lower pH, the presence of cations (di-valent 
Ca2+) and natural organic matters (NOM) were regarded as the main factors to 
influence the aggregation and inactivation of MS2. The results showed that MS2 
aggregated in all solutions at pH 3.0, protecting the inner viruses. At pH 7.0, 
the presence of Na+ cations (0-200 mmol/L) did not affect the inactivation 
efficacy of MS2, which always followed the order of 
particles-free ≈ kaolinite > M. aeruginosa. The inactivation efficacy of MS2 in 
the presence of Ca2+ cations followed the order of 
kaolinite > particles-free > M. aeruginosa at 0-50 mmol/L Ca2+ cations, while 
the inactivation efficacy remained almost constant in the range of 
100-200 mmol/L Ca2+ cations. By contrast, kaolinite offered not enough 
protection to adsorbed MS2, but MS2 aggregation decreased disinfection efficacy 
at a high concentration of Ca2+ cations. Moreover, the presence of humic acid as 
NOM decreased the inactivation of MS2 more significantly than M. aeruginosa due 
to the more consumption of free chlorine from humic acids. Therefore, the 
co-existence of NOM and di-valent Ca2+ cations are potential challenges for the 
inactivation of viruses by sodium hypochlorite in safe drinking water.

Viruses represent major disease transmitting agents carried by human excreta and 
animal manure. Understanding virus inactivation is therefore essential in 
preventing microbial spread due to inadequate treatment of these materials. 
Here, we investigated the inactivation kinetics of the single-stranded (ss) RNA 
phage MS2, DNA phages T4 and ΦX174, andthe double-stranded DNA human adenovirus 
in stored human urine, sludge, and animal manure, at temperatures and pH 
valuestypical of storage under naturally occurring conditions or mesophilic 
anaerobic digestion (<40 °C). The ssRNA phage MS2 was most readily inactivated 
in all samples compared to the other viruses tested. This is consistent with 
previous findings in wellcontrolled buffer solutions of similar composition, 
where inactivation was found to be governedby bases (NH3, carbonate, hydroxide) 
that catalyze the transesterification and cleavage of the ssRNA. 
Correspondingly, MS2 inactivation kinetics in real matrices could be adequately 
modelled by only taking into account the effects of temperature, pH, carbonate 
and ammonia on the integrity of ssRNA. DNA viruses were more persistent compared 
to MS2;however, inactivation in selected sludge and manure samples proceeded at 
faster rates compared to well-controlled buffersolutions of similar composition. 
This indicates a contribution of microbial or enzymatic activity to inactivation 
of DNA viruses. Overall, this study identifies the most important factors 
contributing to inactivation of viruses in human excreta and manure, and 
highlights the differences in inactivation kinetics and mechanisms between ssRNA 
and DNA viruses.

Survival of respiratory viral pathogens in expelled saliva microdroplets is 
central to their transmission, yet the factors that determine survival in such 
microdroplets are not well understood. Here we combine microscopy imaging with 
virus viability assays to study survival of three bacteriophages suggested as 
good models for respiratory pathogens: the enveloped Phi6 (a surrogate for 
SARS-CoV-2), and the non-enveloped PhiX174 and MS2. We measured virus viability 
in human saliva microdroplets, SM buffer, and water following deposition on 
glass surfaces at various relative humidities (RH). Saliva and water 
microdroplets dried out rapidly, within minutes, at all tested RH levels (23%, 
43%, 57%, and 78%), while SM microdroplets remained hydrated at RH ≥ 57%. 
Generally, the survival of all three viruses in dry saliva microdroplets was 
significantly greater than those in SM buffer and water under all RH (except 
PhiX174 in water under 57% RH survived the best among 3 media). Thus, atmosphere 
RH and microdroplet hydration state are not sufficient to explain virus 
survival, indicating that the virus-suspended medium, and association with 
saliva components in particular, likely play a role in virus survival. 
Uncovering the exact properties and components that make saliva a favorable 
environment for the survival of viruses, in particular enveloped ones like Phi6, 
is thus of great importance for reducing transmission of viral respiratory 
pathogens including SARS-CoV-2.

Nickel has been extensively used as a high work function metal because of its 
abundance, low cost, relatively non-toxic nature, and environmentally benign 
characteristics. However, it has rarely been extended in a form of immobilized 
composite, which is a practical strategy applicable for photocatalytic 
antimicrobial activities. In this study, a composite of nickel and TiO2 
(Ni/TiO2) was prepared using a photodeposition method, and its antibacterial 
properties were investigated using Escherichia coli (E. coli). To optimize 
Ni/TiO2 synthesis, the effect of various photodeposition conditions on 
antibacterial performance were investigated, such as the light irradiation time, 
metal content, TiO2 crystalline structure, and presence or absence of electron 
donors (i.e., methanol). The optimized 2 wt% Ni/TiO2 exhibited an antibacterial 
efficiency of 3.74 log within 7 min, which is more than 10-fold higher than that 
of pristine TiO2 (2.54 log). Based on this optimized weight ratio, Ni/TiO2 was 
immobilized on a steel mesh using an electrospray/thermal compression method, 
and its antibacterial performance was further assessed against E. coli, MS2 
bacteriophage virus (MS2 phage), and a common pulmonary pathogen (Legionella 
thermalis, L. thermalis). Within 70 min, all target microorganisms achieved an 
inactivation that exceeded 4 log. Furthermore, the long-term stability and 
sustainable usability of the Ni/TiO2 mesh were confirmed by performing more than 
50 antibacterial evaluation cycles using E. coli. The results of this study 
facilitate the successful utilization of immobilized Ni/TiO2 mesh in water 
disinfection applications.

Wastewater effluents are a reliable water source for non-potable water reuse 
including unrestricted crop irrigation in arid regions suffering from water 
scarcity. This study was performed to develop and optimize a procedure to 
concentrate coliphages from 100 L of treated effluent. Moreover, the reduction 
of coliphages by filtration and disinfection by either chlorine or UV was 
compared with that of fecal coliform (FC). The adsorption efficiency of MS2 and 
Qβ coliphages by the NanoCeram filter was similar and reached 99.8%. Elution 
efficiency of MS2 coliphage from the NanoCeram filters by a solution of 1% NaPP 
and 0.05 M glycine, pH 9.5, was 74  ±  9.5%. The highest reconcentration 
efficiency of MS2 and Qβ coliphages was obtained with polyethylene glycol (PEG) 
precipitation and reached 76  ±  28% and 90  ±  11%, respectively. In 
comparison, the reconcentration efficiency of organic flocculation was 0% and 
1.3% for Qβ and MS2 coliphages, respectively. The overall recovery efficiency of 
MS2 coliphages from 100 L tertiary effluent was 57  ±  1.5%. Poor reduction was 
observed for coliphages compared to FC by filtration and chlorine disinfection 
although; the reduction of FC, as measured by cultivation, was satisfactory and 
within the guidelines for unrestricted irrigation. High correlation between the 
reduction of FC and coliphages was recorded for tertiary effluent disinfected by 
UV irradiation. Monitoring the microbial quality of tertiary effluent using qPCR 
for the enumeration of FC was found unsuitable, because DNA levels were 
unaffected by the treatment processes. The results of this study demonstrated 
that monitoring the microbial quality of tertiary effluent by FC may not reflect 
the health risks encountered by the application of these effluents and the 
addition of coliphages to the monitoring programs may allow for accurate 
assessment of the health risks introduced by the application of tertiary 
effluent.

Oysters contaminated with human enteric viruses from sewage are implicated in 
foodborne outbreaks globally. Bacteriophages have been identified as potential 
indicators for these viruses, but have not been used in shellfish management 
outside of the USA. This study aimed to determine the background levels of F-RNA 
phage in five Australian oyster growing areas with a history of sewage spills 
and closures, over an 18-month period. In addition, oysters from five growing 
areas impacted by adverse sewage events were investigated for F-RNA phage, 
Escherichia coli, norovirus (NoV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV). F-RNA phage ≤ 60 
pfu/100 gm shellfish flesh were found to represent a conservative background 
level in the surveyed areas. Following two of the five sewage spills, elevated 
phage levels were observed in most sample sites less than 4 days post spill. By 
7 days, most sites from all events had phage < 30 pfu/100 gm. NoV was detected 
in day 1 and day 6 samples from one event when all phage were ≤ 30 pfu/100 gm. 
NoV was also detected in a day 3 sample from another event with < 30 phage 
pfu/100 gm, however, multiple replicate samples had elevated phage levels. The 
results of this study add evidence on the potential use of F-RNA phage as a tool 
in early re-opening of oyster harvest areas post sewage spills. However, it also 
highlights the need to better understand situations where phage testing may be 
ineffectual, and the importance of sampling at multiple sites and over multiple 
time points, to effectively capture evidence of contamination.

This study explored the application of colloidal and immobilized silver 
nanoparticles (AgNPs) for inactivation of bacteriophages. Coliphages that are 
commonly used as indicators for enteric viruses, were used in this study. 
Colloidal AgNPs were synthesized via a chemical reduction approach using sodium 
borohydride as reducing agent and trisodium citrate as stabilizing agent. 
AgNP-immobilized glass substrate was prepared by immobilizing AgNPs on 
amine-functionalized glass substrate by post-immobilization method. The 
AgNP-immobilized glass substrate was also tested so as to minimize the release 
of AgNPs in the treated water. The characterization of AgNPs and the 
AgNP-immobilized glass surface was done using field emission gun-transmission 
electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Studies conducted with 
varying concentrations of colloidal AgNPs displayed good antiviral activity for 
MS2 and T4 bacteriophage. Colloidal AgNPs at a dose of 60 μg ml-1 could 
completely inactivate MS2 and T4 bacteriophage within 30 and 50 min with an 
initial concentration of 103 PFU ml-1. Contaminated water (100 ml) in an 
unstirred batch reactor with an initial bacteriophage concentration of 103 PFU 
ml-1 could be inactivated by the AgNP-immobilized glass substrate (1 cm × 1 cm, 
containing 3.7 μg cm-2 silver) suspended centrally in the batch reactor. 
Complete 3-Log bacteriophage inactivation was achieved within 70 and 80 min for 
MS2 and T4 bacteriophage, respectively, while the aqueous silver concentration 
was less than 25 μg l-1. This is significantly lower than the recommended 
standard for silver in drinking water (i.e. 100 μg l-1, US EPA). Thus, 
AgNP-immobilized glass may have good potential for generating virus-free 
drinking water.

The objective of this study was to use high-energy electron beam (HEEB) 
treatments to find surrogate microorganisms for enteric viruses and to use the 
selected surrogates as proof of concept to investigate low-energy electron beam 
(LEEB) treatments for enteric virus inactivation at industrial scale on frozen 
blueberries. Six food matrices inoculated with HAV (hepatitis A virus), MNV S99 
(murine norovirus), bacteriophages MS2 and Qβ, and Geobacillus 
stearothermophilus spores were treated with HEEB at 10 MeV using 4, 8 and 16 kGy 
doses. G. stearothermophilus spores showed the highest inactivation on all 
matrices except on raisins, with a dose-dependent effect. HAV reached the 
maximum measurable log10 reduction (> 3.2 log10) when treated at 16 kGy on 
raisins. MNV showed the highest resistance of all tested microorganisms, 
independent of the dose, except on frozen blueberries. On frozen blueberries, 
freeze-dried raspberries, sesame seeds and black peppercorns, HAV showed a mean 
inactivation level in between those of MS2 and G. stearothermophilus. Based on 
this, we selected both surrogate organisms as first approximation to estimate 
HAV inactivation on frozen blueberries during LEEB treatment at 250 keV using 
16 kGy. Reductions of 3.1 and 1.3 log10 were measured for G. stearothermophilus 
spores and MS2, respectively, suggesting that a minimum reduction of 1.4 log10 
can be expected for HAV under the same conditions.

The pathogen concentration in human excreta needs to be managed appropriately, 
but a predictive approach has yet to be implemented due to a lack of kinetics 
models for pathogen inactivation that are available under varied environmental 
conditions. Our goals were to develop inactivation kinetics models of 
microorganisms applicable under varied environmental conditions of excreta 
matrices and to identify the appropriate indicators that can be monitored during 
disinfection processes. We conducted a systematic review targeting previous 
studies that presented time-course decay of a microorganism and environmental 
conditions of matrices. Defined as a function of measurable factors including 
treatment time, pH, temperature, ammonia concentration and moisture content, the 
kinetic model parameters were statistically estimated using hierarchical 
Bayesian modeling. The inactivation kinetics models were constructed for 
Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Enterococcus, Ascaris eggs, bacteriophage MS2, 
enterobacteria phage phiX174 and adenovirus. The inactivation rates of a 
microorganism were predicted using the established model. Ascaris eggs were 
identified as the most tolerant microorganisms, followed by bacteriophage MS2 
and Enterococcus. Ammonia concentration, temperature and moisture content were 
the critical factors for the Ascaris inactivation. Our model predictions 
coincided with the current WHO guidelines. The developed inactivation kinetics 
models enable us to predict microbial concentration in excreta matrices under 
varied environmental conditions, which is essential for microbiological risk 
management in emerging resource recovery practices from human excreta.

This study compared light and dark disinfection of faecal bacteria/viral 
indicator organisms (E. coli and MS2 (fRNA) bacteriophage) and human viruses 
(Echovirus and Norovirus) in Wastewater Treatment Pond (WTP) mesocosms. Stirred 
pond mesocosms were operated in either outdoor sunlight-exposed or laboratory 
dark conditions in two experiments during the austral summer. To investigate 
wavelength-dependence of sunlight disinfection, three optical filters were used: 
(1) polyethylene film (light control: transmitting all solar UV and visible 
wavelengths), (2) acrylic (removing most UVB <315 nm), and (3) polycarbonate 
(removing both UVB and UVA <400 nm). To assess different dark disinfection 
processes WTP effluent was treated before spiking with target microbes, by (a) 
0.22 μm filtration to remove all but colloidal particles, (b) 0.22 μm filtration 
followed by heat treatment to destroy enzymes, and (c) addition of Cytochalasin 
B to supress protozoan grazing. Microbiological stocks containing E. coli, MS2 
phage, Echovirus, and Norovirus were spiked into each mesocosm 10 min before the 
experiments commenced. The light control exposed to all sunlight wavelengths 
achieved >5-log E. coli and MS2 phage removal (from ~1.0 × 106 to <1 PFU/mL) 
within 3 h compared with up to 6 h in UV-filtered mesocosms. This result 
confirms that UVB contributes to inactivation of E. coli and viruses by direct 
sunlight inactivation. However, the very high attenuation with depth of UVB in 
WTP water (99% removal in the top 8 cm) suggests that UVB disinfection may be 
less important than other removal processes averaged over time and full-scale 
pond depth. Dark removal was appreciably slower than sunlight-mediated 
inactivation. The dark control typically achieved higher removal of E. coli and 
viruses than the 0.22 μm filtered (dark) mesocosms. This result suggests that 
adsorption of E. coli and viruses to WTP particles (e.g., algae and bacteria 
bio-flocs) is an important mechanism of dark disinfection, while bacteria and 
virus characteristics (e.g. surface charge) and environmental conditions can 
influence dark disinfection processes.

We apply an oligo-library and machine learning-approach to characterize the 
sequence and structural determinants of binding of the phage coat proteins (CPs) 
of bacteriophages MS2 (MCP), PP7 (PCP), and Qβ (QCP) to RNA. Using the oligo 
library, we generate thousands of candidate binding sites for each CP, and 
screen for binding using a high-throughput dose-response Sort-seq assay 
(iSort-seq). We then apply a neural network to expand this space of binding 
sites, which allowed us to identify the critical structural and sequence 
features for binding of each CP. To verify our model and experimental findings, 
we design several non-repetitive binding site cassettes and validate their 
functionality in mammalian cells. We find that the binding of each CP to RNA is 
characterized by a unique space of sequence and structural determinants, thus 
providing a more complete description of CP-RNA interaction as compared with 
previous low-throughput findings. Finally, based on the binding spaces we 
demonstrate a computational tool for the successful design and rapid synthesis 
of functional non-repetitive binding-site cassettes.

The aerobic granular sludge (AGS) process is an effective wastewater treatment 
technology for organic matter and nutrient removal that has been introduced in 
the market rapidly. Until now, limited information is available on AGS regarding 
the removal of bacterial and viral pathogenic organisms present in sewage. This 
study focussed on determining the relation between reactor operational 
conditions (plug flow feeding, turbulent aeration and settling) and physical and 
biological mechanisms on removing two faecal surrogates, Escherichia coli and 
MS2 bacteriophages. Two AGS laboratory-scale systems were separately fed with 
influent spiked with 1.0 × 106 CFU/100 mL of E. coli and 1.3 × 108 PFU/100 mL of 
MS2 bacteriophages and followed during the different operational phases. The 
reactors contained only granular sludge and no flocculent sludge. Both systems 
showed reductions in the liquid phase of 0.3 Log10 during anaerobic feeding 
caused by a dilution factor and attachment of the organisms on the granules. 
Higher removal efficiencies were achieved during aeration, approximately 1 Log10 
for E. coli and 0.6 Log10 for the MS2 bacteriophages caused mainly by predation. 
The 18S sequencing analysis revealed high operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of 
free-living protozoa genera Rhogostoma and Telotrochidium concerning the whole 
eukaryotic community. Attached ciliates propagated after the addition of the E. 
coli, an active contribution of the genera Epistylis, Vorticella, and 
Pseudovorticella was found when the reactor reached stability. In contrast, no 
significant growth of predators occurred when spiking the system with MS2 
bacteriophages, indicating a low contribution of protozoa on the phage removal. 
Settling did not contribute to the removal of the studied bacterial and viral 
surrogates.

Background: The precaution of airborne transmission of viruses, such as 
influenza, SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, is essential for reducing infection. In 
this study, we applied a zero-valent nanosilver/titania-chitosan 
(nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS) filter bed, whose broad-spectrum antimicrobial efficacy has 
been proven previously, for the removal of viral aerosols to minimize the risk 
of airborne transmission. Methods: The photochemical deposition method was used 
to synthesize the nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS antiviral material. The surface morphology, 
elemental composition, and microstructure of the nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS were analyzed 
by a scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and a 
transmission electron microscopy, respectively. The MS2 bacteriophages were used 
as surrogate viral aerosols. The antiviral efficacy of nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS was 
evaluated by the MS2 plaque reduction assay (PRA) and filtration experiments. In 
the filtration experiments, the MS2 aerosols passed through the nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS 
filter, and the MS2 aerosol removal efficiency was evaluated by an optical 
particle counter and culture method. Results and Conclusions: In the MS2 PRA, 
3 g of nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS inactivated 97% of MS2 bacteriophages in 20 mL liquid 
culture (2 ± 0.5 × 1016 PFU/mL) within 2 hours. The removal efficiency of 
nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS filter (thickness: 6 cm) for MS2 aerosols reached up to 93%. 
Over 95% of MS2 bacteriophages on the surface of the nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS filter 
were inactivated within 20 minutes. The Wells-Riley model predicted that when 
the nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS filter was used in the ventilation system, airborne 
infection probability would reduce from 99% to 34.6%. The nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS 
filter could remain at 50% of its original antiviral efficiency after continuous 
operation for 1 week, indicating its feasibility for the control of the airborne 
transmission.

Naturally-occurring membranes in the xylem tissue of gymnosperm sapwood enable 
its use as an abundantly-available material to construct filters, with potential 
to facilitate access to safe drinking water in resource-constrained settings. 
However, the material's behavior as a filter is poorly understood, and 
challenges such as short shelf life have not been addressed. Here, we 
characterize the operational attributes of xylem filters and show that the 
material exhibits a highly non-linear dependence of flow resistance on thickness 
upon drying, and a tendency for self-blocking. We develop guidelines for the 
design and fabrication of xylem filters, demonstrate gravity-operated filters 
with shelf life >2 years, and show that the filters can provide >3 log removal 
of E. coli, MS-2 phage, and rotavirus from synthetic test waters and coliform 
bacteria from contaminated spring, tap, and ground waters. Through interviews 
and workshops in India, we use a user-centric approach to design a prototype 
filtration device with daily- to weekly-replaceable xylem filters, and uncover 
indicators of social acceptance of xylem as a natural water filter. Our work 
enhances the understanding of xylem as a filtration material, and opens 
opportunities for engineering a diverse range of low-cost, biodegradable 
xylem-based filtration products on a global scale.

Potable groundwater contamination by human enteric viruses poses serious health 
risks. Our understanding of virus subsurface transport has largely depended on 
studying bacteriophages as surrogates. Few studies have compared the transport 
behaviour of enteric viruses, especially norovirus, with phage surrogates. We 
conducted laboratory column experiments to investigate norovirus and 
bacteriophage MS2 (MS2) filtration in alluvial sand, and rotavirus, adenovirus 
and MS2 filtration in alluvial gravel aquifer media in 2 mM NaCl (pH 6.6-6.9) 
with pore velocities of 4.6-5.4 m/day. The data were analysed using colloid 
filtration theory and HYDRUS-1D 2-site attachment-detachment modelling. 
Norovirus removal was somewhat lower than MS2 removal in alluvial sand. The 
removal of rotavirus and adenovirus was markedly greater than MS2 removal in 
alluvial gravel. These findings concurred with the log10 reduction values, mass 
recoveries, attachment efficiencies and irreversible deposition rate constants. 
The modelling results suggested that the MS2 detachment rates were in the same 
order of magnitude as norovirus, but they were 1 order of magnitude faster than 
those of rotavirus and adenovirus. The attachment of viruses and MS2 was largely 
reversible with faster detachment than attachment rates, favouring free virus 
transport. These findings highlight the risk associated with continual virus 
transport through subsurface media if viruses are not inactivated and 
remobilising previously attached viruses could trigger contamination events. 
Thus, virus attachment reversibility should be considered in virus transport 
predictions in subsurface media. Further research is needed to compare 
surrogates with enteric viruses, especially norovirus, regarding their transport 
behaviours under different experimental conditions.

RiboNucleoProtein particles (RNPs), which are composed of RNAs and proteins, 
play essential roles in many biological processes. The isolation of these 
molecular machines is a critical step to better understand their mechanisms of 
action. In this chapter, we describe the MS2-MBP affinity chromatography used to 
purify the protein content of the RNPs formed with an RNA of interest in a 
nuclear extract. Substrate RNAs are furnished with a tag consisting of three 
stem-loops that provide specific binding sites for the phage MS2 protein. Here, 
we successfully applied this method to isolate RNPs formed with subfragments of 
the long noncoding RNA ANRIL (Antisense Noncoding RNA in the INK4 Locus).

Laboratory Modeling of SARS-CoV-2 Exposure Reduction Through Physically 
Distanced Seating in Aircraft Cabins Using Bacteriophage Aerosol - November 
2020.

Dietrich WL, Bennett JS, Jones BW, Hosni MH.

Aircraft can hold large numbers of persons in close proximity for long periods, 
which can increase the risk for transmission of infectious disease.* Current CDC 
guidelines recommend against travel for persons who have not been vaccinated 
against COVID-19, and a January 2021 CDC order requires masking for all persons 
while on airplanes.†,§ Research suggests that seating proximity on aircraft is 
associated with increased risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that 
causes COVID-19 (1,2). However, studies quantifying the benefit of specific 
distancing strategies to prevent transmission, such as keeping aircraft cabin 
middle seats vacant, are limited. Using bacteriophage MS2 virus as a surrogate 
for airborne SARS-CoV-2, CDC and Kansas State University (KSU) modeled the 
relationship between SARS-CoV-2 exposure and aircraft seating proximity, 
including full occupancy and vacant middle seat occupancy scenarios. Compared 
with exposures in full occupancy scenarios, relative exposure in vacant middle 
seat scenarios was reduced by 23% to 57% depending upon the modeling approach. A 
23% exposure reduction was observed for a single passenger who was in the same 
row and two seats away from the SARS-COV-2 source, rather than in an adjacent 
middle seat. When quantifying exposure reduction to a full 120-passenger cabin 
rather than to a single person, exposure reductions ranging from 35.0% to 39.4% 
were predicted. A 57% exposure reduction was observed under the vacant middle 
seat condition in a scenario involving a three-row section that contained a mix 
of SARS-CoV-2 sources and other passengers. Based on this laboratory model, a 
vacant middle seat reduces risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2 from nearby 
passengers. These data suggest that increasing physical distance between 
passengers and lowering passenger density could help reduce potential COVID-19 
exposures during air travel. Physical distancing of airplane passengers, 
including through policies such as middle seat vacancy, could provide additional 
reductions in SARS-CoV-2 exposure risk.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential for contamination of personnel, patients, and 
the environment during use of contaminated N95 respirators and to compare the 
effectiveness of interventions to reduce contamination.
DESIGN: Simulation study of patient care interactions using N95 respirators 
contaminated with a higher and lower inocula of the benign virus bacteriophage 
MS2.
METHODS: In total, 12 healthcare personnel performed 3 standardized examinations 
of mannequins including (1) control with suboptimal respirator handling 
technique, (2) improved technique with glove change after each N95 contact, and 
(3) control with 1-minute ultraviolet-C light (UV-C) treatment prior to donning. 
The order of the examinations was randomized within each subject. The 
frequencies of contamination were compared among groups. Observations and 
simulations with fluorescent lotion were used to assess routes of transfer 
leading to contamination.
RESULTS: With suboptimal respirator handling technique, bacteriophage MS2 was 
frequently transferred to the participants, mannequin, and environmental 
surfaces and fomites. Improved technique resulted in significantly reduced 
transfer of MS2 in the higher inoculum simulations (P < .01), whereas UV-C 
treatment reduced transfer in both the higher- and lower-inoculum simulations (P 
< .01). Observations and simulations with fluorescent lotion demonstrated 
multiple potential routes of transfer to participants, mannequin, and surfaces, 
including both direct contact with the contaminated respirator and indirect 
contact via contaminated gloves.
CONCLUSION: Reuse of contaminated N95 respirators can result in contamination of 
personnel and the environment even when correct technique is used. 
Decontamination technologies, such as UV-C, could reduce the risk for 
transmission.

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to wreak havoc as worldwide SARS-CoV-2 
infection, hospitalization, and death rates climb unabated. Effective vaccines 
remain the most promising approach to counter SARS-CoV-2. Yet, while promising 
results are emerging from COVID-19 vaccine trials, the need for multiple doses 
and the challenges associated with the widespread distribution and 
administration of vaccines remain concerns. Here, we engineered the coat protein 
of the MS2 bacteriophage and generated nanoparticles displaying multiple copies 
of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. The use of these nanoparticles as vaccines 
generated high neutralizing antibody titers and protected Syrian hamsters from a 
challenge with SARS-CoV-2 after a single immunization with no infectious virus 
detected in the lungs. This nanoparticle-based vaccine platform thus provides 
protection after a single immunization and may be broadly applicable for 
protecting against SARS-CoV-2 and future pathogens with pandemic potential.

The toxicity towards viruses of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) has been reported 
to be dependent on several factors such as particle concentration, size, and 
shape. Although these factors may indeed contribute to the toxicity of AgNPs, 
the results presented in this work demonstrate that surface chemistry and 
especially surface charge is a crucial factor governing their antiviral 
activity. Here, this work investigated the influence of capping agents 
representing various surface charges ranging from negative to positive. These 
AgNPs were capped with citrate, polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyvinylpyrrolidone 
(PVP) mercaptoacetic acid (MAA) and (branched polyethyleneimine (BPEI). We show 
that AgNPs exhibited surface charge-dependent toxicity towards MS2 
bacteriophages. Among the capping agents under investigation, BPEI capped AgNPs 
(Ag/BPEI) exhibited the highest reduction of MS2 resulting in ≥6 log10-units 
reductions, followed by 4-5 log10-units reductions with PVP and PEG capping's 
and 3-4 log10-units with MAA and citrate cappings. Bare nanoparticles reported a 
mere 1-2 log10-units reduction. Electrostatic interaction between the positively 
charged BPEI-coating and the negatively charged virus surface played a 
significant role in bringing the MS2 closer to toxic silver ions (Ag+). Further 
results obtained from TEM showed that Ag/BPEI nanoparticles could directly 
damage the structure of the MS2 bacteriophages. AgNPs and cationic capping 
agents' observed synergy can lead to much lower and much more efficient dosing 
of AgNPs for antiviral applications.

Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a method of nucleic acid 
amplification that is more stable and resistant to DNA amplification inhibitors 
than conventional PCR. LAMP multiplexing with reverse transcription allows for 
the single-tube amplification of several RNA fragments, including an internal 
control sample, which provides the option of controlling all analytical steps. 
We developed a method of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA detection based on multiplex 
reverse-transcription LAMP, with single-tube qualitative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 
RNA and MS2 phage used as a control RNA. The multiplexing is based on the 
differences in characteristic melting peaks generated during the amplification 
process. The developed technique detects at least 20 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA 
per reaction on a background of 12,000 MS2 RNA copies. The total time of 
analysis does not exceed 40 min. The method validation, performed on 125 
clinical samples of patients' nasal swabs, showed a 97.6% concordance rate with 
the results of real-time (RT)-PCR assays. The developed multiplexed LAMP can be 
employed as an alternative to PCR in diagnostic practice to save personnel and 
equipment time.

DNA nanotechnology is leading the field of in vitro molecular-scale device 
engineering, accumulating to a dazzling array of applications. However, while 
DNA nanostructures' function is robust under in vitro settings, their 
implementation in real-world conditions requires overcoming their rapid 
degradation and subsequent loss of function. Viruses are sophisticated 
supramolecular assemblies, able to protect their nucleic acid content in 
inhospitable biological environments. Inspired by this natural ability, we 
engineered in vitro and in vivo technologies, enabling the encapsulation and 
protection of functional DNA nanostructures inside MS2 bacteriophage virus-like 
particles (VLPs). We demonstrate the ssDNA-VLPs nanocomposites' (NCs) abilities 
to encapsulate single-stranded-DNA (ssDNA) in a variety of sizes (200-1500 
nucleotides (nt)), sequences, and structures while retaining their 
functionality. Moreover, by exposing these NCs to hostile biological conditions, 
such as human blood serum, we exhibit that the VLPs serve as an excellent 
protective shell. These engineered NCs pose critical properties that are yet 
unattainable by current fabrication methods.

For structural, biochemical, or pharmacological studies, it is required to have 
pure RNA in large quantities. We previously devised a generic approach that 
allows for efficient in vivo expression of recombinant RNA in Escherichia coli. 
We have extended the "tRNA scaffold" method to RNA-protein coexpression in order 
to express and purify RNA by affinity in native condition. As a proof of 
concept, we present the expression and the purification of the AtRNA-mala in 
complex with the MS2 coat protein.

Human norovirus (hNoV) is an important etiology of gastrointestinal illness and 
can be transmitted via ingestion of contaminated water. Currently impractical to 
culture, hNoV detection is reliant on real-time polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR)-based methods. This approach cannot distinguish between infective and 
inactivated viruses because intact regions of the RNA genome can amplify even if 
the damage is present in other regions of the genome or because intact genetic 
material is not contained within an infectious virion. Herein, we employ a 
multiple long-amplicon RT-qPCR extrapolation approach to assay genome-wide 
damage and an enzymatic pretreatment to study the impact of simulated sunlight 
on the infectivity of hNoV in clear, sensitizer-free water. Using MS2 coliphage 
as an internal control, the genome-wide damage extrapolation approach, 
previously successfully applied for UV-254 inactivation, vastly overestimated 
sunlight inactivation, suggesting key differences in photoinactivation under 
different spectral conditions. hNoV genomic RNA was more susceptible to 
simulated sunlight degradation per base compared to MS2 genomic RNA, while 
enzymatic pretreatment indicated that hNoV experienced more capsid damage than 
MS2. This work provides practical and mechanistic insight into the endogenous 
sunlight inactivation of single-stranded RNA bacteriophage MS2, a widely used 
surrogate, and hNoV GII.4 Sydney, an important health-relevant virus, in clear 
sensitizer-free water.

Water and wastewater virological quality is a significant public health issue. 
Viral agents include emerging and re-emerging pathogens characterized by 
extremely small size, and high environmental stability. Since the mainly used 
conventional disinfection methods are usually not able to achieve complete 
disinfection of viral and other microbial targets, in real water and wastewater 
matrices, effective strategies for the treatment, use and reuse of water and the 
development of next-generation water supply systems are required. The scope of 
the present systematic review was to summarize research data on the application 
of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for viral disinfection of water and 
wastewater. A literature survey was conducted using the electronic databases 
PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. This comprehensive research yielded 23 
records which met the criteria and were included and discussed in this review. 
Most of the studies (14/23) used only MS2 bacteriophage as an index virus, while 
the remaining studies (9/23) used two or more viral targets, including phages 
(MS2, T4, T7, phiX174, PRD-1, S2, ϕB124-14, ϕcrAssphage) and/or Adenovirus, 
Aichivirus, Norovirus (I, II, IV), Polyomavirus (JC and BK), Sapovirus, 
Enterovirus, Coxsackievirus B3, Echovirus, and Pepper mild mottle virus. The 
vast majority of the studies applied a combination of two or more treatments and 
the most frequently used process was ultraviolet light-hydrogen peroxide 
(UV/H2O2) advanced oxidation. The review is expected to highlight the potential 
of the AOPs for public health protection from the waterborne viral exposure.

Norovirus and Rotavirus are among the pathogens causing a large number of 
disease outbreaks due to contaminated water. These viruses are nanoscale 
particles that are difficult to remove by common filtration approaches which are 
based on physical size exclusion, and require adsorption-based filtration 
methods. This study reports the pH-responsive interactions of viruses with 
cationic-modified nanocellulose and demonstrates a filter material that adsorbs 
nanoscale viruses and can be regenerated by changing the solution's pH. The 
bacteria viruses Qbeta and MS2, with diameters below 30 nm but different surface 
properties, are used to evaluate the pH-dependency of the interactions and the 
filtration process. Small angle X-ray scattering, cryogenic transmission 
electron microscopy, and ζ-potential measurements are used to study the 
interactions and analyze changes in their nanostructure and surface properties 
of the virus upon adsorption. The virus removal capacity of the cationic 
cellulose-based aerogel filter is 99.9% for MS2 and 93.6% for Qbeta, at pH = 
7.0; and desorption of mostly intact viruses occurs at pH = 3.0. The results 
contribute to the fundamental understanding of pH-triggered virus-nanocellulose 
self-assembly and can guide the design of sustainable and environmentally 
friendly adsorption-based virus filter materials as well as phage and 
virus-based materials.

Three prophylactic vaccines are approved to protect against HPV infections. 
These vaccines are highly immunogenic. The most recent HPV vaccine, Gardasil-9, 
protects against HPV types associated with ~90% of cervical cancer (worldwide). 
Thus, ~10% of HPV-associated cancers are not protected by Gardasil-9. Although 
this is not a large percentage overall, the HPV types associated with 10% of 
cervical cancer not protected by the current vaccine are significantly 
important, especially in HIV/AIDS patients who are infected with multiple HPV 
types. To broaden the spectrum of protection against HPV infections, we 
developed mixed MS2-L2 VLPs (MS2-31L2/16L2 VLPs and MS2-consL2 (69-86) VLPs) in 
a previous study. Immunization with the VLPs neutralized/protected mice against 
infection with eleven high-risk HPV types associated with ~95% of cervical 
cancer and against one low-risk HPV type associated with ~36% of genital warts & 
up to 32% of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Here, we report that the 
mixed MS2-L2 VLPs can protect mice from three additional HPV types: HPV51, which 
is associated with ~0.8% of cervical cancer; HPV6, which is associated with up 
to 60% of genital warts; HPV5, which is associated with skin cancers in patients 
with epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV). Overall, mixed MS2-L2 VLPs can 
protect against twelve HPV types associated with ~95.8% of cervical cancers and 
against two HPV types associated with ~90% of genital warts and >90% recurrent 
respiratory papillomatosis. Additionally, the VLPs protect against one of two 
HPV types associated with ~90% of HPV-associated skin cancers in patients with 
EV. More importantly, we observed that mixed MS2-L2 VLPs elicit protective 
antibodies that last over 9 months. Furthermore, a spray-freeze-dried 
formulation of the VLPs is stable, immunogenic, and protective at room 
temperature and 37 °C.

Understanding the Folding Mediated Assembly of the Bacteriophage MS2 Coat 
Protein Dimers.

The capsids of RNA viruses such as MS2 are great models for studying protein 
self-assembly because they are made almost entirely of multiple copies of a 
single coat protein (CP). Although CP is the minimal repeating unit of the 
capsid, previous studies have shown that CP exists as a homodimer (CP2) even in 
an acid-disassembled system, indicating that CP2 is an obligate dimer. Here, we 
investigate the molecular basis of this obligate dimerization using 
coarse-grained structure-based models and molecular dynamics simulations. We 
find that, unlike monomeric proteins of similar size, CP populates a single 
partially folded ensemble whose "foldedness" is sensitive to denaturing 
conditions. In contrast, CP2 folds similarly to single-domain proteins 
populating only the folded and the unfolded ensembles, separated by a prominent 
folding free energy barrier. Several intramonomer contacts form early, but the 
CP2 folding barrier is crossed only when the intermonomer contacts are made. A 
dissection of the structure of CP2 through mutant folding simulations shows that 
the folding barrier arises both from the topology of CP and the interface 
contacts of CP2. Together, our results show that CP2 is an obligate dimer 
because of kinetic stability, that is, dimerization induces a folding barrier 
and that makes it difficult for proteins in the dimer minimum to partially 
unfold and access the monomeric state without completely unfolding. We discuss 
the advantages of this obligate dimerization in the context of dimer design and 
virus stability.

Most of the defective/non-infectious enteric phages and viruses that end up in 
wastewater originate in human feces. Some of the causes of this high level of 
inactivity at the host stage are unknown. There is a significant gap between how 
enteric phages are environmentally transmitted and how we might design molecular 
tools that would only detect infectious ones. Thus, there is a need to explain 
the low proportion of infectious viral particles once replicated. By analyzing 
lysis plaque content, we were able to confirm that, under aerobic conditions, 
Escherichia coli produce low numbers of infectious MS2 phages (I) than the total 
number of phages indicated by the genome copies (G) with an I/G ratio of around 
2%. Anaerobic conditions of replication and ROS inhibition increase the I/G 
ratio to 8 and 25%, respectively. These data cannot only be explained by 
variations in the total numbers of MS2 phages produced or in the metabolism of 
E. coli. We therefore suggest that oxidative damage impacts the molecular 
replication and assembly of MS2 phages.

Enteric viruses are commonly present in water bodies in regions with poor 
sanitation. Although the occurrence of these viruses poses a health risk they 
are difficult to quantify due to their low concentration and they may remain 
undetected in the absence of adequate preconcentration. The present study 
reports the synthesis and utilization of DEAE silica gel (DSiG) as an adsorbent 
for virus concentration. Two coliphages, MS2 and SUSP2, and an enteric virus, 
rotavirus A (RVA) were chosen for examining the preconcentration efficiency of 
DSiG columns. Studies conducted at a low flow rate of 5 mL/min yielded good 
removal of viruses through adsorption. Studies at a higher flow rate of 
50 mL/min followed by elution with optimized eluents yielded a high recovery of 
MS2 and RVA even when they were present at low concentration (0.01 copy/mL). The 
eluent Na(1.5 M)-Tw(2%)-G3X (glycine 3X broth, 1.5 M NaCl, 2% Tween, pH 10.2) 
showed maximum elution of RVA and MS2. Optimal SUSP2 recovery was observed on 
employing an eluent composed of 1.5 M NaCl, 3% Tween, 0.05 M KH2PO4 at pH 9.2. 
Subsequently, both the eluents were successively applied for elution of the 
adsorbed viruses. This method was applied for virus preconcentration from lake 
water in the monsoon and winter seasons. The DSiG column could achieve adequate 
preconcentration for all the three viruses, i.e., SUSP2, MS2, and RVA, even when 
they were present at very low concentration and the recovery achieved was 
comparable to that achieved with ultracentrifugation while the processing time 
required for handling large volumes of water was considerably lower.

Aerosols dispersed and transmitted through the air (e.g., particulate matter 
pollution and bioaerosols) are ubiquitous and one of the leading causes of 
adverse health effects and disease transmission. A variety of sampling methods 
(e.g., filters, cyclones, and impactors) have been developed to assess personal 
exposures. However, a gap still remains in the accessibility and ease-of-use of 
these technologies for people without experience or training in collecting 
airborne samples. Additionally, wet scrubbers (large non-portable industrial 
systems) utilize liquid sprays to remove aerosols from the air; the goal is to 
"scrub" (i.e., clean) the exhaust of industrial smokestacks, not collect the 
aerosols for analysis. Inspired by wet scrubbers, we developed a device 
fundamentally different from existing portable air samplers by using aerosolized 
microdroplets to capture aerosols in personal spaces (e.g., homes, offices, and 
schools). Our aerosol-sampling device is the size of a small teapot, can be 
operated without specialized training, and features a winding flow path in a 
supersaturated relative humidity environment, enabling droplet growth. The 
integrated open mesofluidic channels shuttle coalesced droplets to a collection 
chamber for subsequent sample analysis. Here, we present the experimental 
demonstration of aerosol capture in water droplets. An iterative study optimized 
the non-linear flow manipulating baffles and enabled an 83% retention of the 
aerosolized microdroplets in the confined volume of our device. As a 
proof-of-concept for aerosol capture into a liquid medium, 0.5-3 μm model 
particles were used to evaluate aerosol capture efficiency. Finally, we 
demonstrate that the device can capture and keep a bioaerosol (bacteriophage 
MS2) viable for downstream analysis.

UVC disinfection has been recognised by the WHO as an effective disinfection 
treatment to provide decentralized potable water. Under real conditions there 
are still unknowns that limit this application including the influence of 
suspended solids and natural organic matter. This work aims to investigate the 
influence of two key parameters, suspended solids and natural organic matter, on 
the efficiency of UVC disinfection of surface water to achieve the drinking 
water quality requirements established by the WHO for point of use (POU) 
technologies. Kaolinite (turbidity agent) and humic acids (HA, model of organic 
matter) were used in a factorial design of experiments (Turbidity from 0 to 5 
NTU, and HA from 0 to 3.5 mg/L) to investigate their effect on UVC inactivation 
of MS2 phage in surface water. A collimated beam (12 W) and a commercial UVC 
disinfection flow system (16 W) designed to provide drinking water at households 
were used. The UVC flow system both in the laboratory and in the field was able 
to achieve the reduction requirements established by WHO (LRV >3.5 for all 
tested conditions), confirming the good performance of the studied UVC 
disinfection system. The results found in the lab were used to establish a 
numerical model that predicts the disinfection rate constant as a function of 
water turbidity and transmittance at 254 nm (confidence level>95%). The model 
permitted to elucidate the critical effect of low concentrations of HA in 
reducing the inactivation rate by 40% for 3.5 mg/L-HA compared with 0, the 
non-significant detrimental effect of turbidity lower than 5 NTU, and the lack 
of synergistic effects between both parameters at these levels. The UVC flow 
system was also tested in the field, in Tzabalho, Chiapas (Mexico), and 
Antioquia (Colombia), with spiked MS2 into natural surface water. This 
investigation opens a potential application to monitor the performance of UVC 
systems with surface water by monitoring transmittance at 254 nm as a tool to 
control UVC domestic systems to deliver safe drinking water in a household 
without the need of expensive and laborious biological monitoring tools.

AIM: The air indoors has profound health implications as it can expose us to 
pathogens, allergens and particulates either directly or via contaminated 
surfaces. There is, therefore, an upsurge in marketing of air decontamination 
technologies, but with no proper validation of their claims. We addressed the 
gap through the construction and use of a versatile room-sized (25 m3 ) chamber 
to study airborne pathogen survival and inactivation.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we report on the quantitative recovery and detection 
of an enveloped (Phi6) and a non-enveloped bacteriophage (MS2). The two phages, 
respectively, acted as surrogates for airborne human pathogenic enveloped (e.g., 
influenza, Ebola and coronavirus SARS-CoV-2) and non-enveloped (e.g., norovirus) 
viruses from indoor air deposited directly on the lawns of their respective host 
bacteria using a programmable slit-to-agar air sampler. Using this technique, 
two different devices based on HEPA filtration and UV light were tested for 
their ability to decontaminate indoor air. This safe, relatively simple and 
inexpensive procedure augments the use of phages as surrogates for the study of 
airborne human and animal pathogenic viruses.
CONCLUSIONS: This simple, safe and relatively inexpensive method of direct 
recovery and quantitative detection of viable airborne phage particles can 
greatly enhance their applicattion as surrogates for the study of vertebrate 
virus survival in indoor air and assessment of technologies for their 
decontamination.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The safe, economical and simple technique 
reported here can be applied widely to investigate the role of indoor air for 
virus survival and transmission and also to assess the potential of air 
decontaminating technologies.

Fomites can represent a reservoir for pathogens, which may be subsequently 
transferred from surfaces to skin. In this study, we aim to understand how 
different factors (including virus type, surface type, time since last hand 
wash, and direction of transfer) affect virus transfer rates, defined as the 
fraction of virus transferred, between fingerpads and fomites. To determine 
this, 360 transfer events were performed with 20 volunteers using Phi6 (a 
surrogate for enveloped viruses), MS2 (a surrogate for nonenveloped viruses), 
and three clean surfaces (stainless steel, painted wood, and plastic). 
Considering all transfer events (all surfaces and both transfer directions 
combined), the mean transfer rates of Phi6 and MS2 were 0.17 and 0.26, 
respectively. Transfer of MS2 was significantly higher than that of Phi6 
(P < 0.05). Surface type was a significant factor that affected the transfer 
rate of Phi6: Phi6 is more easily transferred to and from stainless steel and 
plastic than to and from painted wood. Direction of transfer was a significant 
factor affecting MS2 transfer rates: MS2 is more easily transferred from 
surfaces to fingerpads than from fingerpads to surfaces. Data from these virus 
transfer events, and subsequent transfer rate distributions, provide information 
that can be used to refine quantitative microbial risk assessments. This study 
provides a large-scale data set of transfer events with a surrogate for 
enveloped viruses, which extends the reach of the study to the role of fomites 
in the transmission of human enveloped viruses like influenza and SARS-CoV-2. 
IMPORTANCE This study created a large-scale data set for the transfer of 
enveloped viruses between skin and surfaces. The data set produced by this study 
provides information on modeling the distribution of enveloped and nonenveloped 
virus transfer rates, which can aid in the implementation of risk assessment 
models in the future. Additionally, enveloped and nonenveloped viruses were 
applied to experimental surfaces in an equivalent matrix to avoid matrix 
effects, so results between different viral species can be directly compared 
without confounding effects of different matrices. Our results indicating how 
virus type, surface type, time since last hand wash, and direction of transfer 
affect virus transfer rates can be used in decision-making processes to lower 
the risk of viral infection from transmission through fomites.

Pool water is continuously circulated and reused after an extensive treatment 
including disinfection by chlorination, ozonation or UV treatment. In Germany, 
these methods are regulated by DIN standard 19643. Recently, the DIN standard 
has been extended by a new disinfection method using hypobromous acid as 
disinfectant formed by introducing ozone into water with naturally or 
artificially high bromide content during water treatment. In this study, we 
tested the disinfection efficacy of the ozone-bromine treatment in comparison to 
hypochlorous acid in a flow-through test rig using the bacterial indicator 
strains Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 
Staphylococcus aureus and the viral indicators phage MS2 and phage PRD1. 
Furthermore, the formation of disinfection by-products and their potential toxic 
effects were investigated in eight pool water samples using different 
disinfection methods including the ozone-bromine treatment. Our results show 
that the efficacy of hypobromous acid, depending on its concentration and the 
tested organism, is comparable to that of hypochlorous acid. Hypobromous acid 
was effective against five of six tested indicator organisms. However, using 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and drinking water as test water, both tested 
disinfectants (0.6 mg L-1 as Cl2 hypobromous acid as well as 0.3 mg L-1 as Cl2 
hypochlorous acid) did not achieve a reduction of four log10 levels within 30 s, 
as required by DIN 19643. The formation of brominated disinfection by-products 
depends primarily on the bromide concentration of the filling water, with the 
treatment method having a smaller effect. The eight pool water samples did not 
show critical values in vitro for acute cytotoxicity or genotoxicity in the 
applied assays. In real pool water samples, the acute toxicological potential 
was not higher than for conventional disinfection methods. However, for a final 
assessment of toxicity, all single substance toxicities of known DBPs present in 
pool water treated by the ozone-bromine treatment have to be analyzed 
additionally.

Virus destabilization and inactivation are critical considerations in providing 
safe drinking water. We demonstrate that iron electrocoagulation simultaneously 
removed (via sweep flocculation) and inactivated a non-enveloped virus surrogate 
(MS2 bacteriophage) under slightly acidic conditions, resulting in highly 
effective virus control (e.g., 5-logs at 20 mg Fe/L and pH 6.4 in 30 min). 
Electrocoagulation simultaneously generated H2O2 and Fe(II) that can potentially 
trigger electro-Fenton reactions to produce reactive oxygen species such as •OH 
and high valent oxoiron(IV) that are capable of inactivating viruses. To date, 
viral attenuation during water treatment has been largely probed by evaluating 
infective virions (as plaque forming units) or genomic damage (via the 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction). In addition to these existing means of 
assessing virus attenuation, a novel technique of correlating transmission 
electron micrographs of electrocoagulated MS2 with their computationally altered 
three-dimensional electron density maps was developed to provide direct visual 
evidence of capsid morphological damages during electrocoagulation. The majority 
of coliphages lost at least 10-60% of the capsid protein missing a minimum of 
one of the 5-fold and two of 3- and 2-fold regions upon electrocoagulation, 
revealing substantial localized capsid deformation. Attenuated total 
reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed potential oxidation 
of viral coat proteins and modification of their secondary structures that were 
attributed to reactive oxygen species. Iron electrocoagulation simultaneously 
disinfects and coagulates non-enveloped viruses (unlike conventional 
coagulation), adding to the robustness of multiple barriers necessary for public 
health protection and appears to be a promising technology for small-scale 
distributed water treatment.

Viruses in the aquatic environment have strong resistance to common disinfection 
techniques. To contribute to the development of efficient virus inactivation 
technologies, the characteristics and mechanisms of virus inactivation in a UV 
activated sodium persulfate(UV/PS) system were studied. The inactivation rate 
and kinetic characteristics of bacteriophage MS2 in water samples by the UV/PS 
were studied. The effects of PS dosage, pH, and the initial concentration of 
bacteriophages on the inactivation effect were also investigated. Furthermore, 
the morphologies of phages before and after UV/PS treatment were observed by 
transmission scanning electron microscope, and the free radicals in the reaction 
system were identified by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. By means 
of a free radical quenching experiment, the contribution rate of various factors 
in the UV/PS system to phage inactivation was also analyzed and calculated. The 
results showed that when the UV irradiation intensity was 160 μW·cm-2, the phage 
MS2 of 4.39 lg could be removed after UV/PS treatment for 4 min, which was 1.44 
lg higher than that of the same UV dose alone. The inactivation of phage MS2 by 
the UV/PS system was in accordance with the first-order kinetic model. 
Increasing the initial concentration of PS in the system significantly improved 
the inactivation rate of phages, while pH and the initial concentration of 
phages had little effect on the inactivation rate. UV/PS treatment damages the 
capsid of phages and promotes the aggregation of phage particles. The presence 
of SO4-· and·OH in the UV/PS system was an important factor for the inactivation 
of MS2 phages. Finally, ·OH contributed more to MS2 phage inactivation than 
SO4-·.

RNA-Protein interactions play important roles in various eukaryotic biological 
processes. Molecular imaging of subcellular localization of RNA/protein 
complexes in plants is critical for understanding these interactions. However, 
methods to image RNA-Protein interactions in living plants have not yet been 
developed until now. Recently, we have developed a trimolecular fluorescence 
complementation (TriFC) system for in vivo visualization of RNA-Protein 
interaction by transient expression in tobacco leaves. In this method, we 
combined conventional bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) system 
with MS2 system (phage MS2 coat protein [MCP] and its binding RNA sequence [MS2 
sequence]) ( Schonberger et al., 2012 ). Target RNA is tagged with 6xMS2 and MCP 
and RNA binding protein are fused with YFP fragments. DNA constructs encoding 
such fusion RNA and proteins are infiltrated into tobacco leaves with 
Agrobacterium suspensions. RNA-Protein interaction in vivo is observed by 
confocal microscope.

Introducing bacteriophage MS2 virus-like particles (VLPs) as gene and drug 
delivery tools increases the demand for optimizing their production and 
purification procedure. PEG precipitation method is used efficiently to purify 
VLPs, while the effects of pH and different electrolytes on the stability, size, 
and homogeneity of purified MS2 VLPs, and the encapsulated RNA sequences 
remained to be elucidated. In this regard, a vector, capable of producing VLP 
with an shRNA packed inside was prepared. The resulting VLPs in different 
buffers/solutions were assessed for their size, polydispersity index, and 
ability to protect the enclosed shRNA. We report that among Tris, HEPES, and 
PBS, with or without NaNO3, and also NaNO3 alone in different pH and ionic 
concentrations, the 100 mM NaNO3-Tris buffer with pH:8 can be used as a new and 
optimal MS2 VLP production buffer, capable of inhibiting the VLPs aggregation. 
These VLPs show a size range of 27-30 nm and suitable homogeneity with minimum 
12-month stability at 4 °C. Moreover, the resulting MS2 VLPs were highly 
efficient and stable for at least 48 h in conditions similar to in vivo. These 
features of MS2 VLPs produced in the newly introduced buffer make them an 
appropriate candidate for therapeutic agents' delivery.

MicroRNAs are related to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma and can 
serve as potential therapeutic targets. Therapeutic strategies increasing 
tumor-suppressive microRNAs and reducing oncogenic microRNAs have been 
developed. Herein, the effects of simultaneously altering two microRNAs using 
MS2 virus-like particles were studied. The sequences of microRNA-21-sponge and 
pre-microRNA-122 were connected and cloned into a virus-like particle expression 
vector. Virus-like particles containing microRNA-21-sponge and pre-microRNA-122 
sequences were prepared and crosslinked with a cell-specific peptide targeting 
hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Delivery effects were studied using RT-qPCR and 
functional assays to investigate the level of target mRNAs, cell toxicity, and 
the effects of proliferation, invasion, and migration. Virus-like particles 
delivered miR-21-sponge into cells, with the Ct value reaching 10 at most. The 
linked pre-miR-122 was processed into mature miR-122. The mRNA targets of miR-21 
were derepressed as predicted and upregulated 1.2-2.8-fold, and the expression 
of proteins was elevated correspondingly. Proliferation, migration, and invasion 
of HCC cells were inhibited by miR-21-sponge. Simultaneous delivery of 
miR-21-sponge and miR-122 further decreased proliferation, migration, and 
invasion by up to 34%, 63%, and 65%, respectively. And the combination promoted 
the apoptosis of HCC cells. In conclusion, delivering miR-21-sponge and miR-122 
using virus-like particles modified by cell-specific peptides is an effective 
and convenient strategy to correct microRNA dysregulation in hepatocellular 
carcinoma cells and is a promising therapeutic strategy for hepatocellular 
carcinoma.

Urban runoff is one of the greatest sources of microbial pollution to surface 
waters. Biofilters can limit the impact of stormwater runoff on surface water 
quality by diverting runoff from receiving waters. However, our understanding of 
how biofilter design choices, including the addition of vegetation and geomedia, 
may impact the removal of pathogens is lacking. In this study, we characterized 
viruses (adenovirus, enterovirus, norovirus GII, crAssphage) in San Francisco 
Bay area urban runoff and assessed the removal of lab-cultured viruses (MS2, 
adenovirus 2, coxsackievirus B5) from biochar-amended biofilter mesocosms during 
challenge testing. We quantified viruses using (RT-)qPCR and F+ coliphage plaque 
assays. We found that all the pathogenic viruses targeted were found at low 
concentrations (adenovirus: all positive samples were <limit of quantification, 
enterovirus: <limit of quantification-1.9 × 102 gc/L, norovirus GII: <limit of 
quantification-1.2 × 102 gc/L) in San Francisco Bay area urban runoff and the 
presence of norovirus GII in runoff was associated with developed land use and 
decreased precipitation. Biofilters had variable success in removing adenovirus, 
enterovirus, and MS2 from runoff in laboratory-scale column experiments. In 
addition, there was no significant difference in the removal of each virus in 
vegetated versus non-vegetated biofilters, with the exception of MS2 which had 
slightly higher removal in vegetated biofilters (0.40 log10 units, Welch's 
t-test, p = 0.004). When comparing removal of human viruses and viral 
indicators, adenovirus and enterovirus were removed more efficiently 
(log10-removal adenovirus = 3.2; log10-removal enterovirus = 1.1) than indicator 
virus MS2 (log10-removal by RT-qPCR = 0.36, log10-removal by plaque 
assay = 0.36). These results provide evidence that MS2 may be a conservative 
indicator for human virus removal in biofiltration systems, but more work is 
needed to examine this relationship. Results from this study can help inform 
design choices regarding biofilters intended to improve water quality and our 
understanding of virus attenuation in biofiltration systems.

Peracetic acid (PAA) is an alternative to traditional wastewater disinfection as 
it has a high oxidation potential without producing chlorinated disinfection 
byproducts. Reports have shown the effectiveness of PAA to reduce waterborne 
viruses, but the mechanism of inactivation is understudied. This study evaluated 
PAA consumption by amino acids and nucleotides that are the building blocks of 
both viral capsids and genomes. Cysteine (>1.7 min-1) and methionine (>1.2 
min-1) rapidly consumed PAA, while cystine (1.9 × 10-2 min-1) and tryptophan 
(1.4 × 10-4 min-1) reactions occurred at a slower rate. All other amino acids 
and nucleotides did not react significantly (p < 0.05) with PAA during 
experiments. Also, PAA treatment did not result in significant (p < 0.05) 
reductions of purified RNA from MS2 bacteriophage and murine norovirus. Data in 
this study suggest that PAA effectively inactivates viruses by targeting 
susceptible amino acids on capsid proteins and does not readily damage viral 
genomes. Knowledge of virus capsid structures and protein compositions can be 
used to qualitatively predict the relative resistance or susceptibility of virus 
types to PAA. Capsid structures containing a higher total number of target amino 
acids may be more susceptible to PAA reactions that damage structural integrity 
resulting in inactivation.

Although SARS-CoV-2 is primarily an airborne risk, the COVID-19 pandemic also 
highlighted the need for self-disinfection surfaces that could withstand the 
demand of high occupant densities characteristic of public transportation 
systems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the durability and antiviral 
activity of a copper film deployed for 90 days in two high touch locations 
within an active metropolitan bus and railcar. The antiviral efficacy of this 
copper film after being deployed in transit vehicles for 90 days (deployed 
copper film) was then compared to new (unused) copper film to determine if 
frequent touches and cleaning protocols could decrease the efficacy of the 
copper films. Deployed copper film, new copper film, and aluminium foil 
(positive control) coupons were inoculated with ~1 × 106 MS2 virus particles, 
allowed a contact time of either 5- or 10-min, and analysed for residual viral 
infectiousness. On both new and deployed copper films, MS2 was completely 
inactivated (≥5 log reduction) at both time points. These results suggest that 
the copper film may provide the durability demanded by high touch public spaces 
while maintaining the antiviral activity necessary to reduce exposure risk and 
viral transmission via surfaces in public transportation settings.

Resuspension of dust from flooring is a major source of human exposure to 
microbial contaminants, but the persistence of viruses on dust and carpet and 
the contribution to human exposure are often unknown. The goal of this work is 
to determine viability of MS2 and Phi6 bacteriophages on cut carpet, looped 
carpet, and house dust both over time and after cleaning. Bacteriophages were 
nebulized onto carpet or dust in artificial saliva. Viability was measured at 0, 
1, 2, 3, 4, 24, and 48 h and after cleaning by vacuum, steam, hot water 
extraction, and disinfection. MS2 bacteriophages showed slower viability decay 
rates in dust (-0.11 hr-1 ), cut carpet (-0.20 hr-1 ), and looped carpet 
(-0.09 hr-1 ) compared to Phi6 (-3.36 hr-1 , -1.57 hr-1 , and -0.20 hr-1 , 
respectively). Viable viral concentrations were reduced to below the detection 
limit for steam and disinfection for both MS2 and Phi6 (p < 0.05), while 
vacuuming and hot water extraction showed no significant changes in 
concentration from uncleaned carpet (p > 0.05). These results demonstrate that 
MS2 and Phi6 bacteriophages can remain viable in carpet and dust for several 
hours to days, and cleaning with heat and disinfectants may be more effective 
than standard vacuuming.

Free chlorine disinfection is widely applied to inactivate viruses by reacting 
with their biomolecules, which include nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids. 
Knowing the reactivities of viral genomes with free chlorine and the protection 
that encapsidation provides would ultimately help predict virus susceptibility 
to the disinfectant. The relative reactivities of different viral genome types 
and the impact of viral higher order structure with free chlorine are poorly 
characterized. Here, we studied the reactivity of viral genomes representing 
four genome types from virus particles with diverse structures, namely, (+)ssRNA 
(MS2), dsRNA (φ6), ssDNA (φX174), and dsDNA (T3) with free chlorine. We compared 
the reactivities of these viral nucleic acids when they were suspended in 
phosphate buffer solutions (naked forms) and when they were in the native virus 
particles (encapsidated forms). The reactivities of nucleic acids were tracked 
by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays. The naked dsDNA of T3 was the 
least reactive with free chlorine, with an average second order rate constant 
normalized by the number of bases in the measured regions (in M-1 s-1 b-1) that 
was 34×, 65×, and 189× lower than those of the dsRNA of φ6, ssRNA of MS2, and 
ssDNA of φX174, respectively. Moreover, different regions in the ssRNA genome of 
MS2 and the dsRNA genome of φ6 exhibited statistically different reaction 
kinetics. The genomes within virus particles reacted slower than the naked 
genomes overall, but the extent of these differences varied among the four 
viruses. The results on viral nucleic acid reactivity help explain different 
susceptibilities of viruses to inactivation by free chlorine and also provide a 
valuable comparison of the susceptibilities of different nucleic acids to 
oxidants.

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates 2.1 billion people lack access to 
safely managed water. Cloth filtration is often employed in rural and developing 
communities of South Asia for point-of-use water treatment, but bacteria and 
viruses are too small for efficient removal by this filtration method. Chitosan 
is a biodegradable, cationic, organic polymer derived from the chemical 
treatment of chitin that acts as a coagulant and flocculant of contaminant of 
microbes and other particles in water, thereby facilitating filtration of 
microbes. This research 1) evaluated the use of chitosan acetate as a 
pre-treatment coagulation-flocculation process followed by cloth filtration for 
microbial reductions and 2) assessed floc particle size under three stirring 
conditions. E. coli KO11 bacteria and MS2 coliphage virus removals were 
quantified using culture-based methods. Chitosan acetate 
coagulation-flocculation pre-treatment of water, followed by cloth filtration, 
met or exceeded the protective (2-star) WHO performance levels for bacteria (2 
log10 reduction) and viruses (3 log10 reduction), and filtrate turbidity was 
consistently reduced to < 1 NTU, meeting United States Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) and WHO targets.

Viruses, including human pathogenic viruses, can persist in water. For producing 
drinking water from surface water via bank filtration, natural attenuation 
capacities and the fate of viruses during the passage of aquatic sediments are 
of particular interest. Moreover, the increasing frequency of extreme 
hydrological events necessitate re-evaluation of the sustainability and efficacy 
of processes removing viruses. For this purpose, we performed bank sediment 
filtration experiments using a mesocosm in a technical-scale experimental 
facility that simulates a field situation under more tightly controlled 
conditions. We used the bacteriophage MS2 as a surrogate for enteric viruses to 
study the transport of different viral loads through the bank sediment. 
Additionally, we simulated a heavy rain event to investigate the re-mobilization 
of initially attached virus particles. We quantified the abundance of infectious 
MS2 phages by plaque assay and the total number of MS2 particles by qPCR. Also, 
we differentiated pore water concentrations by depths of the sediment column and 
investigated attachment to the sediment matrix at the end of the individual 
experimental phases. Bank filtration over a vertical distance of 80 cm through 
sandy sediment revealed a virus removal efficiency of 0.8 log10 for total MS2 
particles and 1.7 log10 for infectious MS2 particles, with an initial phage 
concentration of 1.84 × 108 gene copies mL-1. A low load of infectious MS2 
(1.9 × 106 plaque forming units mL-1) resulted in a greater removal efficiency 
(3.0 log10). The proportion of infectious MS2 phages of the total MS2 particle 
mass steadily decreased over time, i.e., in the course of individual 
breakthrough curves and with sediment depth. The simulated pulse of rainwater 
caused a front of low ionic strength water which resulted in pronounced phage 
remobilization. The high proportion of infectious MS2 among the detached phages 
indicated that attachment to the sediment matrix may substantially conserve 
virus infectivity. Therefore, the re-mobilization of previously attached viruses 
owing to hydrological extremes should be considered in water quality assessment 
and monitoring schemes.

The hydrophobicity of virions is a major physicochemical parameter regulating 
their dissemination in humans and the environment. But knowledge about potential 
factors modulating virion hydrophobicity is limited due to the lack of suitable 
quantifying methods. It has been recently shown that sodium dodecyl-sulfate 
(SDS) labels capsid hydrophobic domains in capillary zone electrophoresis of 
non-enveloped virions, altering their electrophoretic mobility (μ) in proportion 
to their hydrophobicity. This was exploited here to quantify the hydrophobicity 
of GA, Qβ and MS2 phages as a function of pH. By subtracting the native from the 
SDS-modified μ of phages, measured in the absence and presence of SDS, 
respectively, we defined a "hydrophobic index" increasing with virion 
hydrophobicity. Using this approach, we found that the virion hydrophobicity 
changes at a virion-specific pivotal pH. This procedure may be applied under 
various physicochemical conditions and to diverse non-enveloped virus families 
of significance to human health and the environment.

Using a combination of biochemistry, mass spectrometry, NMR spectroscopy and 
cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we have been able to show that 
quasi-equivalent conformer switching in the coat protein (CP) of an RNA 
bacteriophage (MS2) is controlled by a sequence-specific RNA-protein 
interaction. The RNA component of this complex is an RNA stem-loop encompassing 
just 19 nts from the phage genomic RNA, which is 3569 nts in length. This 
binding results in the conversion of a CP dimer from a symmetrical conformation 
to an asymmetric one. Only when both symmetrical and asymmetrical dimers are 
present in solution is assembly of the T = 3 phage capsid efficient. This 
implies that the conformers, we have characterized by NMR correspond to the two 
distinct quasi-equivalent conformers seen in the 3D structure of the virion. An 
icosahedrally-averaged single particle cryo-EM reconstruction of the wild-type 
phage (to, ~9 Å resolution) has revealed icosahedrally ordered density 
encompassing up to 90% of the single-stranded RNA genome. The RNA is seen with a 
novel arrangement of two concentric shells, with connections between them along 
the 5-fold symmetry axes. RNA in the outer shell interacts with each of the 90 
CP dimers in the T = 3 capsid and although the density is icosahedrally 
averaged, there appears to be a different average contact at the different 
quasi-equivalent protein dimers: precisely the result that would be expected if 
protein conformer switching is RNA-mediated throughout the assembly pathway. 
This unprecedented RNA structure provides new constraints for models of viral 
assembly and we describe experiments aimed at probing these. Together, these 
results suggest that viral genomic RNA folding is an important factor in 
efficient assembly, and further suggest that RNAs that could sequester viral CPs 
but not fold appropriately could act as potent inhibitors of viral assembly.

Assessing the presence of viruses in large-volume samples involves cumbersome 
methods that require specialized training and laboratory equipment. In this 
study, a large volume concentration (LVC) method, based on dead-end 
ultrafiltration (DEUF) and Wet Foam Elution™ technology, was evaluated in 
different type of waters and different microorganisms. Its recovery efficiency 
was evaluated through different techniques (infectivity assays and molecular 
detection) by spiking different viral surrogates (bacteriophages PhiX174 and MS2 
and Coxsackie virus B5 (CVB5) and Escherichia coli (E. coli). Furthermore, the 
application of a secondary concentration step was evaluated and compared with 
skimmed milk flocculation. Viruses present in river water, seawater and 
groundwater samples were concentrated by applying LVC method and a centrifugal 
ultrafiltration device (CeUF), as a secondary concentration step and quantified 
with specific qPCR Human adenoviruses (HAdV) and noroviruses (NoVs). MS2 was 
used as process control, obtaining a mean viral recovery of 22.0 ± 12.47%. The 
presence of other viruses was also characterized by applying two different 
next-generation sequencing approaches. LVC coupled to a secondary concentration 
step based on CeUF allowed to detect naturally occurring viruses such as HAdV 
and NoVs in different water matrices. Using HAdV as a human fecal indicator, the 
highest viral pollution was found in river water samples (100% of positive 
samples), followed by seawater (83.33%) and groundwater samples (66.67%). The 
LVC method has also proven to be useful as a virus concentration method in the 
filed since HAdV and NoVs were detected in the river water and groundwater 
samples concentrated in the field. All in all, LVC method presents high 
concentration factor and a low limit of detection and provides viral 
concentrates useful for subsequent molecular analysis such as PCR and massive 
sequencing.

This study assessed the norovirus (NoV) surrogate bacteriophage MS2 transfer 
from stainless steel, glass and low-density polypropylene surfaces to raspberry 
and pitanga fruits. The effect of sodium hypochlorite (100 ppm, 1 min) on MS2 
survival on whole fruits, the MS2 survival in sanitized fruits and derived pulps 
during frozen storage, and in response to preservation technologies (heat, 
organic acids and salts) was also assessed. The highest (p < 0.05) viral 
transfer (%) was observed from glass and stainless steel (∼90%) to raspberry, 
and from glass and polypropylene (∼75%) to pitanga, after 60 min of contact. 
Sodium hypochlorite reduced (p < 0.05) MS2 titer by 3.5 and 3.8 log PFU/g in 
raspberry and pitanga, respectively. MS2 decreased (p < 0.05) up to 1.4 log 
PFU/g in frozen stored sanitized fruits (whole fruits and pulps) after 15 days, 
with no further changes after 30 days. Thermal treatments reduced MS2 titer 
(p < 0.05) in both fruit pulps. MS2 inactivation was higher in pitanga pulp. The 
addition of ascorbic acid, citric acid, sodium benzoate, or sodium metabisulfite 
had little effect (<1 log PFU/g) on MS2 concentration in either fruit. These 
results may inform NoV risk management practice in processing and handling of 
fruits.

Background: The reprocessing of medical devices has become more complex due to 
increasing hygiene requirements. Previous studies showed satisfactory 
bactericidal disinfection effects of UV-C light in rigid and flexible 
endoscopes. Especially in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, 
virucidal properties are of high importance. In the present study, the virucidal 
efficacy of UV-C light surface disinfection was analyzed. Methods: MS-2 
bacteriophages were applied to the test samples and irradiated by UV-C light 
using the UV Smart D25 device; unirradiated test samples were used as controls. 
A dilution series of the samples was mixed with 1 × 108 Escherichia coli and 
assayed. Results: 8.6 × 1012 pfu could be harvested from the unprocessed test 
samples. In the control group without UV-C exposure, a remaining contamination 
of 1.2 × 1012 pfu was detected, resulting in a procedural baseline reduction 
rate with a LOG10 reduction factor of 0.72. The LOG10 reduction factor was found 
to be 3.0 after 25 s of UV-C light exposure. After 50 and 75 s of UV-C radiation 
LOG10 reduction factors 4.2 and 5.9, respectively, were found, with all 
reductions being statistically significantly different to baseline. Conclusions: 
The tested UV system seems to provide a significant virucidal effect after a 
relatively short irradiation time.

The RNA phage MS2 is one of the most important model organisms in molecular 
biology and virology. Despite its comprehensive characterisation, the 
composition of the RNA replication machinery remained obscure. Here, we 
characterised host proteins required to reconstitute the functional replicase in 
vitro. By combining a purified replicase sub-complex with elements of an in 
vitro translation system, we confirmed that the three host factors, EF-Ts, 
EF-Tu, and ribosomal protein S1, are part of the active replicase holocomplex. 
Furthermore, we found that the translation initiation factors IF1 and IF3 
modulate replicase activity. While IF3 directly competes with the replicase for 
template binding, IF1 appears to act as an RNA chaperone that facilitates 
polymerase readthrough. Finally, we demonstrate in vitro formation of RNAs 
containing minimal motifs required for amplification. Our work sheds light on 
the MS2 replication machinery and provides a new promising platform for 
cell-free evolution.

Phellinus Quél is one of the largest genera of Hymenochaetaceae; it comprises 
about 220 species widely distributed on Earth. Most Phellinus species are 
lignicolous mushrooms that accumulate bioactive compounds. This research studied 
the phenolic composition of Phellinus spp. and their relationship with 
antibacterial and antiviral capacity. Phenolics were extracted from Phellinus 
badius, P. fastuosus, and P. grenadensis; their antiviral and antibacterial 
activities were evaluated against Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, 
Salmonella enterica, and Escherichia coli O157: H7; and the bacteriophages MS2 
and Φ- × 174. Gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, epicatechin, ferulic 
acid, catechin, 1,3-dicaffeoylquinic acid, p-coumaric acid, and rutin were found 
in different proportions among Phellinus spp. Total phenolic content ranged from 
96 to 209 mg GAE/g, and total flavonoids from 10 to 27 QE/g. The minimum 
inhibitory concentrations of P. badius, P. grenadensis, and P. fastuosus against 
E. coli O157: H7 were 13, 20, and 27 mg/mL, against S. enterica were 20, 30, and 
15 mg/mL, and against L. monocytogenes were 10, 15, and 25 mg/mL, respectively. 
The phenolic content was better correlated with the antibacterial effect against 
E. coli O157: H7 and L. monocytogenes (r = 0.8-0.9), but not against S. enterica 
(r = 0.05). The antiviral activity of the extracts (0.9 mg/mL) was 29 to 41% 
against MS2 and 27 to 38% for Φ-X174 virus (r = 0.8-0.9). In silico analysis 
showed binding energy values of - 7.9 and - 4.8 kcal/mol between the identified 
phenolic compounds and the M and G proteins of each virus. The antibacterial and 
antiviral properties of Phellinus species were correlated with the phenolic 
content.

The development of affordable, effective, and environmentally friendly barrier 
fabrics is a current goal in antimicrobial textile development. The discovery of 
new routes to achieve non-toxic naturally occurring molecules with antimicrobial 
activity is of interest in the development of materials that promote wound 
healing, improve hygiene, and offer protection against nosocomial infection. 
Highly cleaned and sterile unbleached cotton has constituents that produce 
hydrogen peroxide at levels commensurate with those that favor cell signaling in 
wound healing. Here, we show the antimicrobial and antiviral properties of 
spunlaced griege cotton-containing nonwovens treated with ascorbic acid 
formulations. The mechanism of action occurs through the promotion of enhanced 
hydrogen peroxide activity. The levels of hydrogen peroxide activity afford 
antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and 
antiviral activity against MS2 bacteriophages. Spun-bond nonwoven unbleached 
cotton was treated with ascorbic acid using traditional pad-dry-cure methods. An 
assessment of antibacterial and antiviral activity against Staphylococcus 
aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and MS2 bacteriophages with the AATCC 100 test 
method showed a 99.99% inhibitory activity. An approach to the covalent 
attachment of ascorbic to cellulose through citric acid crosslinking chemistry 
is also discussed. Thus, a simple, low-cost approach to antimicrobial and 
antiviral cotton-based nonwovens applicable to dressings, nosocomial barrier 
fabrics, and face masks can be adopted by combining ascorbic acid with spunlace 
greige cotton nonwoven fabrics.

The recent COVID-19 disease has highlighted the need for further research around 
the risk to human health and the environment because of mass burial of COVID-19 
victims. Despite SARS-CoV-2 being an enveloped virus, which is highly 
susceptible to environmental conditions (temperature, solar/UV exposure). This 
review provides insight into the potential of SARS-CoV-2 to contaminate 
groundwater through burial sites, the impact of various types of burial 
practices on SARS-CoV-2 survival, and current knowledge gaps that need to be 
addressed to ensure that humans and ecosystems are adequately protected from 
SARS-CoV-2. Data available shows temperature is still likely to be the driving 
factor when it comes to survival and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. Research 
conducted at cemetery sites globally using various bacteriophages (MS2, PRD1, 
faecal coliforms) and viruses (TGEV, MHV) as surrogates for pathogenic enteric 
viruses to study the fate and transport of these viruses showed considerable 
contamination of groundwater, particularly where there is a shallow vadose zone 
and heterogeneous structures are known to exist with very low residence times. 
In addition, changes in solution chemistry (e.g., decrease in ionic strength or 
increase in pH) during rainfall events produces large pulses of released 
colloids that can result in attached viruses becoming remobilised, with 
implications for groundwater contamination. Viruses cannot spread unaided 
through the vadose zone. Since groundwater is too deep to be in contact with the 
interred body and migration rates are very slow, except where preferential flow 
paths are known to exist, the groundwater table will not be significantly 
impacted by contamination from SARS-CoV-2. When burial takes place using 
scientifically defensible methods the possibility of infection will be highly 
improbable. Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has helped us to prepare for 
other eventualities such as natural disasters where mass fatalities and 
subsequently burials may take place in a relatively short space of time.

Activated carbon (AC) exhibits superior sorption properties compared to other 
porous materials, due to well-developed porous structures and high surface 
areas. Therefore, it is widely applied in its various forms in water 
purification to remove a diverse range of contaminating species. The presence of 
viruses in fresh water bodies poses a serious issue for human health. However, 
AC has not yet been commonly applied to waterborne virus removal. In this study, 
we present oxidation and copper impregnation treatment procedures of activated 
carbon fibers (ACFs) that resulted in porous structure and surface chemistry 
modifications. The effect of these modifications on virus removal was 
investigated by experimental flow studies and revealed up to 2.8 log10 reduction 
value (LRV) and 3.6 LRV of MS2 bacterio-phages for non-modified and oxidized 
ACFs, respectively, emphasizing the advantages of ACF surface functionalization. 
Copper modified fibers demonstrated a high sensitivity to media composition, 
resulting in a release of metal and therefore limited virucidal capacity.

The antiviral function of carbon dots (CDots) with visible light exposure was 
evaluated, for which the model bacteriophages MS2 as a surrogate of small RNA 
viruses were used. The results show clearly that the visible light-activated 
CDots are highly effective in diminishing the infectivity of MS2 in both low and 
high titer samples to the host E. coli cells, and the antiviral effects are dot 
concentration- and treatment time-dependent. The action of CDots apparently 
causes no significant damage to the structural integrity and morphology of the 
MS2 phage or the breakdown of the capsid proteins, but does result in the 
protein carbonylation (a commonly used indicator for protein oxidation) and the 
degradation of viral genomic RNA. Mechanistically the results may be understood 
in the framework of photodynamic effects that are associated with the unique 
excited state properties and processes of CDots. Opportunities for potentially 
broad applications of CDots coupled with visible/natural light in the prevention 
and control of viral transmission and spread are highlighted and discussed.

Fullerene's low water solubility was a serious challenge to researchers aiming 
to harness their excellent photochemical properties for aqueous applications. 
Cationic functionalization of the fullerene cage provided the most effective 
approach to increase water solubility, but common synthesis practices 
inadvertently complicated the photochemistry of these systems by introducing 
iodide as a counterion. This problem was overlooked until recent work noted a 
potentiation effect which occurred when photosensitizers were used to inactivate 
microorganisms with added potassium iodide. In this work, several photochemical 
pathways were explored to determine the extent and underlying mechanisms of 
iodide's interference in the photosensitization of singlet oxygen by cationic 
fulleropyrrolidinium ions and rose bengal. Triplet excited state sensitizer 
lifetimes were measured via laser flash photolysis to probe the role of I- in 
triplet sensitizer quenching. Singlet oxygen production rates were compared 
across sensitizers in the presence or absence of I-, SO42-, and other anions. 
3,5-Dimethyl-1H-pyrazole was employed as a chemical probe for iodine radical 
species, such as I·, but none were observed in the photochemical systems. 
Molecular iodine and triiodide, however, were found in significant quantities 
when photosensitizers were irradiated in the presence of I- and O2. The 
formation of I2 in these photochemical systems calls into question the 
interpretations of prior studies that used I- as a counterion for 
photosensitizer materials. As an example, MS2 bacteriophages were inactivated 
here by cationic fullerenes with and without I- present, showing that I- 
moderately accelerated the MS2 deactivation, likely by producing I2. Production 
of I2 did not appear to be directly correlated with estimates of 1O2 
concentration, suggesting that the relevant photochemical pathways are more 
complex than direct reactions between 1O2 and I- in the bulk solution. On the 
basis of the results here, iodine photochemistry may be underappreciated and 
misunderstood in other environmental systems.

We studied the effect of a new targeted drug Pefagtal that represents a 
conjugate in which the MS2 phage filled with a substance toxic to cells 
(thallium salts) is covalently linked to peptides containing the RGD motif. The 
antitumor and pronounced antimetastatic effects of Pefagtal were demonstrated on 
transplanted mouse tumors differing in histological type and status of 
metastasis: Krebs-2 ascites adenocarcinoma of the mammary gland, Lewis lung 
adenocarcinoma, hepatoma-29, and lung adenocarcinoma. It is assumed that the RGD 
motif mediates primary binding of the construct to αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins that 
are predominantly overexpressed in the endothelial cells of tumor blood vessels 
and in tumor and metastatic cells.

CRISPR systems are prokaryotic adaptive immune systems that use RNA-guided Cas 
nucleases to recognize and destroy foreign genetic elements. To overcome CRISPR 
immunity, bacteriophages have evolved diverse families of anti-CRISPR proteins 
(Acrs). Recently, Lin et al. (2020) described the discovery and characterization 
of 7 Acr families (AcrVIA1-7) that inhibit type VI-A CRISPR systems. We detail 
several inconsistencies that question the results reported in the Lin et al. 
(2020) study. These include inaccurate bioinformatics analyses and bacterial 
strains that are impossible to construct. Published strains were provided by the 
authors, but MS2 bacteriophage plaque assays did not support the published 
results. We also independently tested the Acr sequences described in the 
original report, in E. coli and mammalian cells, but did not observe anti-Cas13a 
activity. Taken together, our data and analyses prompt us to question the claim 
that AcrVIA1-7 reported in Lin et al. are type VI anti-CRISPR proteins.

Point-of-use ceramic filters are one of the strategies to address problems 
associated with waterborne diseases to remove harmful microorganisms in water 
sources prior to its consumption. In this study, development of adsorption-based 
ceramic depth filters composed of alumina platelets was achieved using spray 
granulation (calcined at 800 °C). Their virus retention performance was assessed 
using cartridges containing granular material (4 g) with two virus surrogates: 
MS2 and fr bacteriophages. Both materials showed complete removal, with a 7 
log10 reduction value (LRV) of MS2 up to 1 L. MgAl2O4-modified Al2O3 granules 
possessed a higher MS2 retention capacity, contrary to the shortcomings of 
retention limits in pure Al2O3 granules. No significant decline in the retention 
of fr occurred during filtration tests up to 2 L. The phase composition and 
morphology of the materials were preserved during filtration, with no magnesium 
or aluminum leakage during filtration, as confirmed by X-ray diffractograms, 
electron micrographs, and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission 
spectrometry. The proposed MgAl2O4-modified Al2O3 granular ceramic filter 
materials offer high virus retention, achieving the criterion for virus 
filtration as required by the World Health Organization (LRV ≥ 4). Owing to 
their high thermal and chemical stability, the developed materials are thus 
suitable for thermal and chemical-free regeneration treatments.

Bacteriophages are viruses that attack and usually kill bacteria. Their 
appearance in the industrial facilities using bacteria to produce active 
compounds (e.g., drugs, food, cosmetics, etc.) causes considerable financial 
losses. Instances of bacteriophage resistance towards disinfectants and 
decontamination procedures (such as thermal inactivation and photocatalysis) 
have been reported. There is a pressing need to explore new ways of phage 
inactivation that are environmentally neutral, inexpensive, and more efficient. 
Here, we study the effect of zero-valent iron nanoparticles (nZVI) on four 
different bacteriophages (T4, T7, MS2, M13). The reduction of plaque-forming 
units (PFU) per mL varies from greater than 7log to around 0.5log depending on 
bacteriophages (M13 and T7, respectively). A comparison of the importance of 
oxidation of nZVI versus the release of Fe2+/Fe3+ ions is shown. The mechanism 
of action is proposed in connection to redox reactions, adsorption of virions on 
nZVI, and the effect of released iron ions. The nZVI constitutes a critical 
addition to available antiphagents (i.e., anti-bacteriophage agents).

Background: Nanosilver possesses antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, 
anti-angiogenesis, antiplatelet, and anticancer properties. The development of 
disinfectants, inactivated vaccines, and combined etiotropic and 
immunomodulation therapy against respiratory viral infections, including 
COVID-19, remains urgent. Aim: Our goal was to determine the SARS-CoV-2 
molecular targets (genomic RNA and the structural virion proteins S and N) for 
silver-containing nanomaterials. Methods: SARS-CoV-2 gene cloning, purification 
of S2 and N recombinant proteins, viral RNA isolation from patients' blood 
samples, reverse transcription with quantitative real-time PCR ((RT)2-PCR), 
ELISA, and multiplex immunofluorescent analysis with magnetic beads (xMAP) for 
detection of 17 inflammation markers. Results: Fluorescent Ag nanoclusters (NCs) 
less than 2 nm with a few recovered silver atoms, citrate coated Ag 
nanoparticles (NPs) with diameters of 20-120 nm, and nanoconjugates of 50-150 nm 
consisting of Ag NPs with different protein envelopes were constructed from 
AgNO3 and analyzed by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic 
force microscopy (AFM), ultraviolet-visible light absorption, and fluorescent 
spectroscopy. SARS-CoV-2 RNA isolated from COVID-19 patients' blood samples was 
completely cleaved with the artificial RNase complex compound 
Li+[Ag+2Cys2-(OH-)2(NH3)2] (Ag-2S), whereas other Ag-containing materials 
provided partial RNA degradation only. Treatment of the SARS-CoV-2 S2 and N 
recombinant antigens with AgNO3 and Ag NPs inhibited their binding with specific 
polyclonal antibodies, as shown by ELISA. Fluorescent Ag NCs with albumin or 
immunoglobulins, Ag-2S complex, and nanoconjugates of Ag NPs with protein shells 
had no effect on the interaction between coronavirus recombinant antigens and 
antibodies. Reduced production of a majority of the 17 inflammation biomarkers 
after treatment of three human cell lines with nanosilver was demonstrated by 
xMAP. Conclusion: The antiviral properties of the silver nanomaterials against 
SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus differed. The small-molecular-weight artificial RNase 
Ag-2S provided exhaustive RNA destruction but could not bind with the SARS-CoV-2 
recombinant antigens. On the contrary, Ag+ ions and Ag NPs interacted with the 
SARS-CoV-2 recombinant antigens N and S but were less efficient at performing 
viral RNA cleavage. One should note that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was more stable than MS2 
phage RNA. The isolated RNA of both the MS2 phage and SARS-CoV-2 were more 
degradable than the MS2 phage and coronavirus particles in patients' blood, due 
to the protection with structural proteins. To reduce the risk of the virus 
resistance, a combined treatment with Ag-2S and Ag NPs could be used. To prevent 
cytokine storm during the early stages of respiratory infections with 
RNA-containing viruses, nanoconjugates of Ag NPs with surface proteins could be 
recommended.

The inactivation of bacteriophage MS2 under irradiation above 320 nm was 
investigated, focusing on different solution pH, ionic strength, and Suwannee 
River natural organic matter (SRNOM) concentrations when solutions contained 
organic or inorganic particle matters. Inorganic and organic particles were 
modeled using kaolinite (KAO) and Microcystis aeruginosa (MA), respectively. The 
results showed that the two types of particles influenced on MS2 inactivation 
under different conditions. The lower pH contributed to the greater MS2 
aggregation within pH range of 3.0 to 8.0, leading to an increasing inactivation 
rate. The presence of KAO induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) under the action 
of irradiation above 320 nm, which promoted the inactivation of MS2. By 
comparison, the [Formula: see text] produced by MA after irradiation promoted 
the inactivation at pH < 6, whereas when the pH is ≥ 6, the inactivation effect 
of MS2 was lower than that of particle-free solution because MS2 was no longer 
aggregated and MA has a shading effect. In the presence of Na+ or Ca2+ cation, 
irradiation above 320 nm could not effectively inactivate the MS2 under 
particle-free solution. By comparison, KAO increased the inactivation efficiency 
as a photosensitizer. With the increase of Ca2+ concentration, MS2 was more 
easily adsorbed to MA than aggregation. Until Ca2+ concentration reached 20 mM, 
the inactivation effect in MA solution was enhanced. In the presence of SRNOM, 
the inactivation effect increased with the increase of SRNOM concentration. When 
the SRNOM was 20 mM, the inactivation increased in the particle-free solution 
due to the greater production of [Formula: see text]. Compared with the 
particle-free solution, the KAO and MA inactivation efficiency was lower.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a multi-scale impact on the world population 
that started from a nano-scale respiratory virus and led to the shutdown of 
macro-scale economies. Direct transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute 
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) and its variants through aerosolized 
droplets is a major contributor towards increasing cases of this infection. To 
curb the spread, one of the best engineered solutions is the use of face masks 
to prevent the passage of infectious saliva micro-droplets from an infected 
person to a healthy person. The commercially available masks are single use, 
passive face-piece filters. These become difficult to breathe in during 
strenuous activities. Also, they need to be disposed regularly due to 
accumulation of unwanted particulate and pathogens over time. Frequent disposal 
of these masks is unsustainable for the environment. In this study, we have 
proposed a novel design for a filter for enhanced virus filtration, better 
breathability, and virus inactivation over time. The filter is called Hy-Cu 
named after its (Hy) drophobic properties and another significant layer 
comprises of copper (Cu). The breathability (pressure drop across filter) of 
Hy-Cu is tested and compared with widely used surgical masks and KN95 masks, 
both experimentally and numerically. The results show that the Hy-Cu filter 
offers at least 10% less air resistance as compared to commercially available 
masks. The experimental results on virus filtration and inactivation tests using 
MS2 bacteriophage (a similar protein structure as SARS-CoV-2) show that the 
novel filter has 90% filtering efficiency and 99% virus inactivation over a 
period of 2 h. This makes the Hy-Cu filter reusable and a judicious substitute 
to the single use masks.

The COVID-19 pandemic has raised interest in using devices that generate 
ultraviolet C (UVC) radiation as an alternative approach for reducing or 
eliminating microorganisms on surfaces. Studies investigating the efficacy of 
UVC radiation against pathogens use a wide range of laboratory methods and 
experimental conditions that can make cross-comparison of results and 
extrapolation of findings to real-world settings difficult. Here, we use three 
different UVC-generating sources - a broad-spectrum pulsed xenon light, a 
continuous light-emitting diode (LED), and a low-pressure mercury vapour lamp - 
to evaluate the impact of different experimental conditions on UVC efficacy 
against the coliphage MS2 on surfaces. We find that a nonlinear dose-response 
relationship exists for all three light sources, meaning that linear 
extrapolation of doses resulting in a 1-log10 (90%) reduction does not 
accurately predict the dose required for higher (e.g. 3-log10 or 99.9%) log10 
reductions. In addition, our results show that the inoculum characteristics and 
underlying substrate play an important role in determining UVC efficacy. 
Variations in microscopic surface topography may shield MS2 from UVC radiation 
to different degrees, which impacts UVC device efficacy. These findings are 
important to consider in comparing results from different UVC studies and in 
estimating device performance in field conditions.

Several virus concentration methods have been developed to increase the 
detection sensitivity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) in wastewater, as part of applying wastewater-based epidemiology. 
Polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation method, a method widely used for 
concentrating viruses in wastewater, has some limitations, such as long 
processing time. In this study, Pegcision, a PEG-based method using magnetic 
nanoparticles (MNPs), was applied to detect SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, with 
several modifications to increase its sensitivity and throughput. An enveloped 
virus surrogate, Pseudomonas phage φ6, and a non-enveloped virus surrogate, 
coliphage MS2, were seeded into wastewater samples and quantified using reverse 
transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction to assess the recovery 
performance of the Pegcision. Neither increasing MNP concentration nor reducing 
the reaction time to 10 min affected the recovery, while adding polyacrylic acid 
as a polyanion improved the detection sensitivity. The performance of the 
Pegcision was further compared to that of the PEG precipitation method based on 
the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and surrogate viruses, including indigenous pepper 
mild mottle virus (PMMoV), in wastewater samples (n = 27). The Pegcision showed 
recovery of 14.1 ± 6.3 % and 1.4 ± 1.0 % for φ6 and MS2, respectively, while the 
PEG precipitation method showed recovery of 20.4 ± 20.2 % and 18.4 ± 21.9 % (n = 
27 each). Additionally, comparable PMMoV concentrations were observed between 
the Pegcision (7.9 ± 0.3 log copies/L) and PEG precipitation methods (8.0 ± 0.2 
log copies/L) (P > 0.05) (n = 27). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was successfully detected in 
11 (41 %) each of 27 wastewater samples using the Pegcision and PEG 
precipitation methods. The Pegcision showed comparable performance with the PEG 
precipitation method for SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration, suggesting its 
applicability as a virus concentration method.

Immersive ultraviolet disinfection provides a chemical-free technology for safer 
textiles, surfaces, and public spaces by inactivating communicable pathogens. 
This study examined immersive UV disinfection, using a disinfection cabinet, of 
E. coli and MS2 that was inoculated on white cotton T-shirts. The impact that 
porous materials have on UV disinfection is poorly understood with the majority 
of previous surface disinfection research focusing on hard, smooth surfaces. 
Several approaches were used in this study to characterize the light dynamics 
within the disinfection cabinet including colorimetric dosimetry coupons, 
biodosimetry, and spectroradiometry. Micro and macro geometry of porous surfaces 
are important factors to consider when using immersive UV technologies. The 
geometry of the cabinet impacted the distribution of emitted UV light within the 
disinfection cabinet and the physical properties of a porous material, such as 
the woven pattern of cotton, both contribute to UV disinfection efficiency. This 
work identified that light distribution is crucial for immersive UV technologies 
as the delivered fluence was highly variable within the disinfection cabinet and 
resulted in a difference of several logs of reduction for adjacent areas of 
T-shirt samples. Other inoculated areas achieved upwards of 1-log reductions 
values for MS2 and upwards of 2-log reductions for E. coli.

Overexpression is one of the classical approaches to study pleiotropic functions 
of genes of interest. To achieve overexpression, we often increase the 
transcription by introducing genes on exogenous vectors or by using the 
CRISPR/dCas9-based transcriptional activation system. To date, the most 
efficient CRISPR/dCas9-based transcriptional activator is the Synergistic 
Activation Mediator (SAM) system whereby three different transcriptional 
activation domains are directly fused to dCas9 and MS2 phage Coat Protein (MCP), 
respectively, and the system in Drosophila is named flySAM. Here we describe the 
effective and convenient transcriptional activation system, flySAM, starting 
from vector construction, microinjection, and transgenic fly selection to the 
phenotypic analysis.

Many single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses regulate assembly of their 
infectious virions by forming multiple, cognate coat protein (CP)-genome 
contacts at sites termed Packaging Signals (PSs). We have determined the 
secondary structures of the bacteriophage MS2 ssRNA genome (gRNA) frozen in 
defined states using constraints from X-ray synchrotron footprinting (XRF). 
Comparison of the footprints from phage and transcript confirms the presence of 
multiple PSs in contact with CP dimers in the former. This is also true for a 
virus-like particle (VLP) assembled around the gRNA in vitro in the absence of 
the single-copy Maturation Protein (MP) found in phage. Since PS folds are 
present at many sites across gRNA transcripts, it appears that this genome has 
evolved to facilitate this mechanism of assembly regulation. There are striking 
differences between the gRNA-CP contacts seen in phage and the VLP, suggesting 
that the latter are inappropriate surrogates for aspects of phage 
structure/function. Roughly 50% of potential PS sites in the gRNA are not in 
contact with the protein shell of phage. However, many of these sit adjacent to, 
albeit not in contact with, PS-binding sites on CP dimers. We hypothesize that 
these act as PSs transiently during assembly but subsequently dissociate. 
Combining the XRF data with PS locations from an asymmetric cryo-EM 
reconstruction suggests that the genome positions of such dissociations are 
non-random and may facilitate infection. The loss of many PS-CP interactions 
towards the 3' end of the gRNA would allow this part of the genome to transit 
more easily through the narrow basal body of the pilus extruding machinery. This 
is the known first step in phage infection. In addition, each PS-CP dissociation 
event leaves the protein partner trapped in a non-lowest free-energy 
conformation. This destabilizes the protein shell which must disassemble during 
infection, further facilitating this stage of the life-cycle.

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which suddenly appeared at the beginning of 2020, 
revealed our knowledge deficits in terms of ventilation and air pollution 
control. It took many weeks to realize that aerosols are the main route of 
transmission. The initial attempt to hold back these aerosols through textile 
masks seemed almost helpless, although there is sufficient knowledge about the 
retention capacity of fabric filters for aerosols. In the absence of a 
sufficient number of permanently installed heating, ventilation, and air 
conditioning systems, three main approaches are pursued: (a) increasing the air 
exchange rate by supplying fresh air, (b) using mobile air purifiers, and (c) 
disinfection by introducing active substances into the room air. This article 
discusses the feasibility of these different approaches critically. It also 
provides experimental results of air exchange measurements in a school classroom 
that is equipped with a built-in fan for supplying fresh air. With such a fan 
and a window tilted at the appropriate distance, an air exchange rate of 5/h can 
be set at a low power level and without any significant noise pollution. Heat 
balance calculations show that no additional heat exchanger is necessary in a 
normal classroom with outside temperatures above 10°C. Furthermore, a commercial 
mobile air purifier is studied in a chamber and a test room setup in order to 
examine and evaluate the efficiency of such devices against viable viruses under 
controlled and realistic conditions. For this purpose, bacteriophages of the 
type MS2 are used. Both window ventilation and air purifiers were found to be 
suitable to reduce the concentration of phages in the room.

The COVID-19 pandemic remains ever prevalent and afflicting-partially because 
one of its transmission pathways is aerosol. With the widely used central air 
conditioning systems worldwide, indoor virus aerosols can rapidly migrate, thus 
resulting in rapid infection transmission. It is therefore important to install 
microbial aerosol treatment units in the air conditioning systems, and we herein 
investigated the possibility of combining such filtration with UV irradiation to 
address virus aerosols. Results showed that the removal efficiency of filtration 
towards f2 and MS2 phages depended on the type of commercial filter material and 
the filtration speed, with an optimal velocity of 5 cm/s for virus removal. 
Additionally, it was found that UV irradiation had a significant effect on 
inactivating viruses enriched on the surfaces of filter materials; MS2 phages 
had greater resistance to UV-C irradiation than f2 phages. The optimal 
inactivation time for UV-C irradiation was 30 min, with higher irradiation times 
presenting no substantial increase in inactivation rate. Moreover, excessive 
virus enrichment on the filters decreased the inactivation effect. Timely 
inactivation is therefore recommended. In general, the combined system involving 
filtration with UV-C irradiation demonstrated a significant removal effect on 
virus aerosols. Moreover, the system is simple and economical, making it 
convenient for widespread implementation in air-conditioning systems.

Although electrospun nanomaterials containing photoactive dyes currently compete 
with the present state of art antimicrobial materials, relatively few 
structure-activity relationships have been established to identify the role of 
carrier polymer and photosensitizer binding mode on the performance of the 
materials. In this study scaffolds composed of poly(vinyl alcohol), 
polyacrylonitrile, poly(caprolactone), and tailor-made phthalocyanine-based 
photosensitizers are developed utilizing electrospinning as a simple, time and 
cost-effective method. The photoinduced activity of nanofibrous materials was 
characterized in vitro against E. coli and B. subtilis as models for 
Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria respectively, as well as against 
bacteriophages phi6 and MS2 as models for enveloped and non-enveloped viruses 
respectively. For the first time, we show how polymer-specific properties affect 
antifouling and antimicrobial activity of the nanofibrous material, indicating 
that the most promising way to increase efficiency is likely via methods that 
focus on increasing the number of short, but strong and reversible 
bacteria-surface interactions.

Waterborne virus contamination might easily adsorb on the organic or inorganic 
surface in the complex aquatic environment. A quartz crystal microbalance 
coupled with dissipation monitoring was used to investigate the effects of the 
ionic strength of monovalent cation and divalent cation and pH on the deposition 
kinetics of bacteriophage MS2 on silica surface coated with Microcystis 
aeruginosa or kaolin, which represents organic or inorganic particle, 
respectively. Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek theory was used to illustrate the 
deposition mechanisms of MS2. The increased concentration of Na+ significantly 
enhanced the deposition rates of MS2 on both coated silica surfaces due to the 
reduction of repulsive electrostatic interactions. However, the MS2 deposition 
rates decreased at higher ionic strength of Ca2+, which accounted for the steric 
and hydrophobic interactions. And the higher MS2 deposition rates on both 
surfaces occurred at pH 3. In addition, the deposition rates of MS2 on 
kaolin-coated silica surfaces were higher than on the Microcystis-coated surface 
under all studied conditions. Furthermore, the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek 
theory could elucidate the deposition mechanism in Na+ solution, whereas the 
steric and hydrophobic interactions should be considered for the presence of 
high concentration of Ca2+.

We demonstrated that methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 
contamination on floors in the rooms of colonized long-term care facility 
residents was frequently transferred by shoes to adjacent patient rooms. A 
benign virus inoculated onto the floor was transferred to floors and high-touch 
surfaces in adjacent rooms and the nursing station. These results suggest that 
shoes may serve as a vector for dissemination of health care-associated 
pathogens from rooms of MRSA-colonized patients.

MS2 bacteriophage is often used as a model for evaluating pathogenic viruses' 
behavior in aqueous solution. However, the questions of the virus surface's 
hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance, the charge distribution, and the binding 
mechanism are open. Using the dynamic light scattering method and laser Doppler 
electrophoresis, the hydrodynamic diameter and the ζ-potential of the virus 
particles were measured at their concentration of 5 × 1011 particles per mL and 
ionic strength 0.03 M. The values were found to be 30 nm and -29 or -34 mV (by 
Smoluchowski or Ohshima approximations), respectively. The MS2 bacteriophage 
surface was also investigated using a series of acid-base indicator dyes of 
various charge type, size, and structure. Their spectral and acid-base 
properties (pKa) are very sensitive to the microenvironment in aqueous solution, 
including containing nanoparticles. The electrostatic potential of the surface Ψ 
was estimated using the common formula: Ψ = 59 × (pKai - pKa) in mV at 25 °C. 
The Ψ values were -50 and +10 mV, respectively, which indicate the "mosaic" way 
of the charge distribution on the surface. These data are in good agreement with 
the obtained ζ-potential values and provide even more information about the 
virus surface. It was found that the surface of the MS2 virus is hydrophilic in 
solution in contrast to the commonly accepted hypothesis of the hydrophobicity 
of virus particles. No hydrophobic interactions between various molecular probes 
and the capsid were observed.

The persistence of high consequence public health pathogens in a wastewater 
treatment system can significantly impact worker safety, as well as the public 
and downstream water bodies, particularly if the system is forced to shut down 
the treatment processes. This study utilizes organism viability to compare the 
persistence of three pathogen surrogates in wastewater using a pilot-scale 
activated sludge treatment (AST) system, operated to mimic treatment processes 
of large-scale plants. Bacillus globigii spores, surrogate for Bacillus 
anthracis, persisted in the AST system for at least a 50-day observation period 
leading to a possible steady condition far beyond the solid retention time for 
sludge particles. MS2 bacteriophage, surrogate for Poliovirus and other 
non-enveloped enteric viruses, was observed for up to 35 days after 
introduction, which largely and expectedly correlated to the measured solid 
retention time. Phi-6 bacteriophage, a surrogate for Ebola virus and other 
enveloped viruses, was detected for no more than 4 days after introduction, even 
though the AST system was operated to provide three times slower solids removal 
than for the other surrogates. This suggests Phi-6 is subject to inactivation 
under AST conditions rather than physical removal. These results may suggest 
similar persistence for the surrogated pathogens, leading to appropriate 
consequence management actions.

In this research, the synergistic antiviral effects of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) 
and metal oxides (MO) in the form of novel hybrid structures (MO-CNTs) are 
presented. Raw CNTs, Ni(OH)2, Fe2O3 and MnO2, as well as Ni(OH)2-CNT, Fe2O3-CNT 
and MnO2-CNT were explored in this study against Escherichia. coli MS2 
bacteriophage, which was used as a virus surrogate. The nano particles were 
synthesized and characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy 
(FESEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron 
microscopy (TEM), particle size analysis, Fourier-transform infrared 
spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Kinetic parameters such as the 
LD50 (lethal dose to kill 50% of the population), T50 and T80 (time taken to 
kill 50% and 80% of the population), SGR (specific growth rate) and IRD (initial 
rate of deactivation of the population) were also studied to examine the 
antiviral efficacy of these nanomaterials. Among all the nanomaterials, 
Ni(OH)2-CNT was the most effective antiviral agent followed by Fe2O3-CNT, 
MnO2-CNT, raw CNTs, Ni(OH)2, Fe2O3 and MnO2. When comparing the metal oxide-CNTs 
to the raw CNTs, the average enhancement was 20.2%. The average antiviral 
activity enhancement of the MO-CNTs were between 50 and 54% higher than the MO 
itself. When compared to the raw CNTs, the average enhancement over all the 
MO-CNTs was 20.2%. The kinetic studies showed that the LD50 of Ni(OH)2-CNT was 
the lowest (16µg/mL), which implies that it was the most toxic of all the 
compounds studied. The LD50 of Ni(OH)2, Fe2O3 and MnO2 were 17.3×, 14.5× and 
10.8× times greater than their corresponding hybrids with the CNTs. The 
synergistic mechanism involved the entrapment of phage viruses by the nano 
structured CNTs leading to structural damage along with toxicity to phage from 
the release of MO ions. The metal oxide-CNT nano hybrids developed in this 
project are promising candidates in applications such as antiviral coatings, 
nanocomposites, adsorbents and as components of personal protection gears.

Oysters are filter-feeders and retain sewage-derived pathogens in their organs 
or tissues. Since most enteric viruses involved in outbreaks cannot grow in cell 
culture, studies using viral surrogate models are essential. Some species are 
proposed as surrogates for enteric viruses in environmental samples, including 
in bivalve mollusk samples, such as murine norovirus type 1 (MNV-1) and somatic 
(as φX) or F-specific coliphages (as MS2) bacteriophages. This study evaluated 
the tissue distribution of viral surrogates for enteric virus contamination 
after their bioaccumulation by Crassostrea gigas. Oyster tissues were analyzed 
for the distribution of viral surrogates (MNV-1, φX-174, and MS2) in digestive 
tissue (DT), gills (GL), and mantle (MT) after 4, 6, and 24 h of experimental 
bioaccumulation. MNV-1 had higher counts at 6 h in DT (1.2 × 103 PFU/g), 
followed by GL and MT (9.5 × 102 and 3.8 × 102 PFU/g, respectively). The 
bacteriophage φX-174 had a higher concentration in the MT at 4 and 6 h 
(3.0 × 102 PFU/g, in both) and MS2 in the GL after 24 h (2.2 × 102 PFU/g). The 
bioaccumulation pattern of MNV-1 by oysters was similar to the other enteric 
viruses (more in DT), while that of phages followed distinct patterns from 
these. Since the MNV-1 is bioaccumulated by C. gigas and is adapted to grow in 
cell culture, it is an important tool for bioaccumulation and viral inactivation 
tests in oysters. Although bacteriophage bioaccumulation was not similar to 
enteric viruses, they can be indicated for viral bioaccumulation analysis, 
analyzing MT and GL, since they do not bioaccumulate in DT.

Despite the ubiquity of viruses in soils, their diversity in soil water has not 
been explored, mainly due to the difficulty of collecting them. In hydrology, 
soil water is usually collected using porous candles. This study proposes using 
these porous candles as a new tool for sampling viruses in soil water to analyze 
their passage through the ceramic part of the candles. The recovery of the 
viruses was determined after filtration under laboratory conditions using three 
model bacteriophages (MS2, ΦX174, and Φ6) and Escherichia coli, at neutral and 
acidic pH. Then, a field experiment was carried out where soil water filtration 
and viral identification by metagenomic shotgun were performed. At neutral pH, 
all bacteriophages tested successfully passed through the porous candles during 
the filtration process, with reductions of 0.02 log, 0.16 log, and 0.55 log for 
MS2 ΦX174 and Φ6, respectively. At pH 4.4, the passage of MS2 was not affected 
while ΦX174 underwent a slight reduction in recovery, probably caused by 
adsorption onto the filter material. Regarding the application of the porous 
candles in the field, the results obtained allowed the successful recovery of 
viruses, exposing porous candles as a new method suitable for the collection of 
viruses from soil water in the context of the study of viral communities.

Face masks and respirators are commonly used to prevent the transmission of 
infectious diseases that spread by respiratory droplets and aerosols. However, 
there is still uncertainty about the protective effect of the different types of 
masks against virus containing aerosols. To determine the as-worn bioaerosol 
protection efficacy of different face coverings and estimate the possible 
protective function against airborne diseases, we challenged different 
respirators and medical masks on a standardized dummy head with a bioaerosol 
containing MS2 bacteriophages as virus surrogates. In our experiments, FFP2 
respirators showed the highest filtration efficacy 94 ± 4 (SD) % followed by 
medical masks 93 ± 3 (SD) % and KN95 respirators 90 ± 7 (SD) %. Nevertheless, we 
found no statistically significant difference between respirators and medical 
masks in terms of provided protection against infective aerosols. Our findings 
indicate that both respirators and medical masks provide a high as-worn 
bioaerosol protection efficacy against virus containing aerosols, and therefore, 
a very high protection against airborne diseases. Considering the higher 
comfort, better availability, and lower price of medical masks in contrast to 
respirators, it is recommendable to use medical face masks especially in low 
risk situations and in general public.

Ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (UV LEDs) have shown ability to inactivate 
microorganisms and viruses in water. The unique characteristic of the UV-LEDs' 
diversity in wavelengths ranging from UV-C, UV-B, and UV-A, allows for 
wavelengths to be combined in different manners for polychromatic irradiation. 
Previous studies reported no synergy from simultaneous or sequential UV-C and 
UV-B as well as UV-C or UV-B followed by UV-A irradiation. However, synergy was 
reported for UV-A followed by UV-C or UV-B irradiation on various 
microorganisms. Nevertheless, no clear ground has been reached on whether to 
adopt single UV-C wavelengths or UV-A followed by UV-C LED, irradiation on 
inactivation of microorganisms and viruses in water. Therefore, this work 
evaluates the disinfection efficacy of single UV-C as well as UV-A followed by 
UV-C LED irradiation on Escherichia coli, Bacillus spizizenii spores and MS2 
bacteriophage in water. The UV-C wavelengths were represented by 267 and 278 nm 
UV LEDs, and UV-A by 368 nm UV LEDs. In this study, E. coli was highly 
susceptible to UV radiation followed by B. spizizenii spores, and lastly MS2. 
Repair following UV inactivation was only observed in E. coli. The synergistic 
effect found in both E. coli, and B. spizizenii spores was attributed to the 
different inactivation mechanisms of the UV-C and UV-A wavelengths. In both 
single UV-C, and UV-A followed by UV-C LED irradiations, single 267 nm UV-C LED 
showed higher inactivation efficacy. Meanwhile, single 278 nm UV-C LED showed 
higher efficacy in terms of suppression of repair, and electrical energy 
consumption. Using single UV-C LEDs in a water disinfection system cuts down on 
related extra costs by avoiding combined wavelengths while still attaining 
better levels of microorganism inactivation, repair suppression and electrical 
energy consumption. These findings are applicable for the design and 
implementation of UV LED water disinfection systems.

Due to the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 
pandemic, the interest and demand for sterilization devices to reuse PPE has 
increased. For reuse of face masks, they must be effectively decontaminated of 
potential infectious agents without compromising its filtration ability during 
sterilization. In this study, we utilized an atmospheric pressure pulsed 
dielectric barrier discharge (DBD), combined with nebulized liquid microdroplets 
to generate plasma-activated mist (PAM). MS2 and T4 bacteriophages were used to 
conduct the decontamination tests on two types of N95 respirators. Results 
showed at least a 2-log reduction of MS2 and T4 on N95 respirators treated in 
one cycle with 7.8% hydrogen peroxide PAM and at least a 3-log reduction treated 
in 10% hydrogen peroxide PAM. In addition, it was found that there was no 
significant degradation in filtration efficiency of N95 respirators (3M 1860 and 
1804) treated in 10% hydrogen peroxide PAM found after 20 cycles. In terms of 
re-useability of masks after treatment as determined, it was shown that the 
elastic straps of 3M 1804 were fragmented after 20 treatment cycles rendering 
them unusable, while the straps of 3M 1860 were not negatively affected even 
after 20 disinfection cycles.

The COVID-19 pandemic involving SARS-CoV-2 has raised interest in using 
antimicrobial lipid formulations to inhibit viral entry into their host cells or 
to inactivate them. Lipids are a part of the innate defense mechanism against 
pathogens. Here, we evaluated the use of nano-monocaprin (NMC) in inhibiting 
enveloped (phi6) and unenveloped (MS2) bacteriophages. NMC was prepared using 
the sonochemistry technique. Size and morphology analysis revealed the formation 
of ~ 8.4 ± 0.2-nm NMC as measured by dynamic light scattering. We compared the 
antiviral activity of NMC with molecular monocaprin (MMC) at 0.5 mM and 2 mM 
concentrations against phi6, which we used as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2. The 
synthesized NMC exhibited 50% higher antiviral activity against phi6 than MMC at 
pH 7 using plaque assay. NMC inactivated phi6 stronger at pH 4 than at pH 7. To 
determine if NMC is toxic to mammalian cells, we used MTS assay to assess its 
IC50 for HPDE and HeLa cell lines, which were ~ 203 and 221 µM, respectively. 
NMC may be used for prophylactic application either as a drop or spray since 
many viruses enter the human body through the mucosal lining of the nose, eyes, 
and lungs.

RNA is a polymer with pivotal functions in many biological processes. RNA 
structure determination is thus a vital step toward understanding its function. 
The secondary structure of RNA is stabilized by hydrogen bonds formed between 
nucleotide basepairs, and it defines the positions and shapes of functional 
stem-loops, internal loops, bulges, and other functional and structural 
elements. In this work, we present a methodology for studying large intact RNA 
biomolecules using homonuclear 15N solid-state NMR spectroscopy. We show that 
proton-driven spin-diffusion experiments with long mixing times, up to 16 s, 
improved by the incorporation of multiple rotor-synchronous 1H inversion pulses 
(termed radio-frequency dipolar recoupling pulses), reveal key hydrogen-bond 
contacts. In the full-length RNA isolated from MS2 phage, we observed strong and 
dominant contributions of guanine-cytosine Watson-Crick basepairs, and beyond 
these common interactions, we observe a significant contribution of the 
guanine-uracil wobble basepairs. Moreover, we can differentiate basepaired and 
non-basepaired nitrogen atoms. Using the improved technique facilitates 
characterization of hydrogen-bond types in intact large-scale RNA using 
solid-state NMR. It can be highly useful to guide secondary structure prediction 
techniques and possibly structure determination methods.

Water treatment and reuse is gaining acceptance as a strategy to fight against 
water contamination and scarcity, but it usually requires complex treatments to 
ensure safety. Consequently, the electrochemical advanced processes have emerged 
as an effective alternative for water remediation. The main objective here is to 
perform a systematic study that quantifies the efficiency of a laboratory-scale 
electrochemical system to inactivate bacteria, bacterial spores, protozoa, 
bacteriophages and viruses in synthetic water, as well as in urban wastewater 
once treated in a wetland for reuse in irrigation. A Ti|RuO2-based plate and 
Si|BDD thin-film were comparatively employed as the anode, which was combined 
with a stainless-steel cathode in an undivided cell operating at 12 V. Despite 
the low resulting current density (<15 mA/cm2), both anodes demonstrated the 
production of oxidants in wetland effluent water. The disinfection efficiency 
was high for the bacteriophage MS2 (T99 in less than 7.1 min) and bacteria (T99 
in about 30 min as maximum), but limited for CBV5 and TuV, spores and amoebas 
(T99 in more than 300 min). MS2 presented a rapid exponential inactivation 
regardless of the anode and bacteria showed similar sigmoidal curves, whereas 
human viruses, spores and amoebas resulted in linear profiles. Due the different 
sensitivity of microorganisms, different models must be considered to predict 
their inactivation kinetics. On this basis, it can be concluded that evaluating 
the viral inactivation from inactivation profiles determined for bacteria or 
some bacteriophages may be misleading. Therefore, neither bacteria nor 
bacteriophages are suitable models for the disinfection of water containing 
enteric viruses. The electrochemical treatment added as a final disinfection 
step enhances the inactivation of microorganisms, which could contribute to safe 
water reuse for irrigation. Considering the calculated low energy consumption, 
decentralized water treatment units powered by photovoltaic modules might be a 
near reality.

Due to increasing public concern over hygiene, there have been many studies 
investigating antimicrobial and antiviral agents recently. With the aim of 
developing biobased virucidal/virus capture agents, we report a chemical 
modification of the cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) surface with 
poly(2-dimethylamino) ethyl acrylate) methyl chloride quaternary salt (Q-PDMAEA) 
to introduce the positively charged functional groups. The surface of CNCs was 
modified through direct and indirect graft polymerization. Subsequently, the 
direct and indirect cationization effect on the degree of functionalization, 
thermal stability, crystallinity, and antiviral activity of CNCs was 
investigated. Indirect cationization produced the highest degree of polymer 
grafting, increasing particle size and thermal stability. Further, the modified 
CNCs were tested for their ability to capture nonenveloped bacteriophages 
PhiX174 (ΦX174) and MS2. We observed a significant (>4.19 log10) reduction in 
total viral load by specific functionalized CNCs. However, the activity depended 
on the structure of functional groups, surface charge density, and the type of 
virus under study. Overall, the direct and indirect cationization of CNC leads 
to biobased agents with immobilized cationic charge, with good virus capture 
activity. Such agents can be used for various applications including textiles, 
packaging, wastewater treatment, etc.

In South Korea, testing disinfectants against foot-and-mouth disease virus 
(FMDV) that are contagious in livestock or that require special attention with 
respect to public hygiene can be manipulated only in high-level containment 
laboratories, which are not easily available. This causes difficulties in the 
approval procedure for disinfectants, such as a prolonged testing period. 
Additionally, the required biosafety level (BSL) in the case of FMDV has 
hindered its extensive studies. However, this drawback can be circumvented by 
using a surrogate virus to improve the performance of the efficacy testing 
procedure for disinfectants. Therefore, we studied bacteriophage MS2 (MS2) and 
bovine enterovirus type 1 (ECBO) with respect to disinfectant susceptibility for 
selecting a surrogate for FMDV according to the Animal and Plant Quarantine 
Agency (APQA) guidelines for efficacy testing of veterinary disinfectants. 
Effective concentrations of the active substances in disinfectants (potassium 
peroxymonosulfate, sodium dichloroisocyanurate, malic acid, citric acid, 
glutaraldehyde, and benzalkonium chloride) against FMDV, MS2, and ECBO were 
compared and, efficacies of eight APQA-listed commercial disinfectants used 
against FMDV were examined. The infectivity of FMDV and ECBO were confirmed by 
examination of cytopathic effects, and MS2 by plaque assay. The results reveal 
that the disinfectants are effective against MS2 and ECBO at higher 
concentrations than in FMDV, confirming their applicability as potential 
surrogates for FMDV in efficacy testing of veterinary disinfectants.

The COVID-19 outbreak has raised concerns about the efficacy of the disinfection 
process followed in water treatment plants in preventing the spread of viruses. 
Ultraviolet (UV) and chlorine multi-barrier disinfection processes are commonly 
used in water treatment plants; however, their effects on virus inactivation are 
still unclear. In this study, the effects of different disinfection processes 
(i.e., UV, free chlorine, and their combination) on waterborne viruses were 
analyzed using bacteriophage surrogates (i.e., MS2 and PR772) as alternative 
indicators. The results showed that the inactivation rates of PR772 by either UV 
or free chlorine disinfection were higher than those of MS2. PR772 was 
approximately 1.5 times more sensitive to UV disinfection and 8.4 times more 
sensitive to chlorine disinfection than MS2. Sequential UV-chlorine disinfection 
had a synergistic effect on virus inactivation, which was enhanced by an 
increase in the UV dose. As compared with single free chlorine disinfection, UV 
irradiation at 40 mJ cm-2 enhanced MS2 and PR772 inactivation significantly with 
a 2.7-fold (MS2) and a 1.7-fold (PR772) increase in the inactivation rate 
constants on subsequent chlorination in phosphate buffered saline. The 
synergistic effect was also observed in real wastewater samples, in which the 
MS2 inactivation rate increased 1.4-fold on subsequent chlorination following UV 
irradiation at 40 mJ cm-2. The mechanism of the synergistic effect of sequential 
UV-chlorine disinfection was determined via sodium dodecyl 
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, using MS2 as an indicator. The 
results showed that the synergistic effect was due to damage to MS2 surface 
proteins caused by previous UV disinfection, which enhanced the sensitivity of 
MS2 to chlorination. This study provides a feasible approach for the efficient 
inactivation of viruses in water supply and drainage.

The applicability of chemical actinometry to characterize the fluence in UV 
reactors with reflections, non-parallel light, and variable water transmittance 
is limited due to the unknown effective path length or hydraulic shortcuts 
within the reactor. In this study, the effects of reflection and transmittance 
on actinometry were examined and a new, optimized and easy method for 
determining fluence was developed. KI/KIO3 and uridine actinometry experiments 
were carried out under controlled conditions using a collimated beam apparatus 
and a completely mixed batch reactor with or without diffuse reflection and 
compared to biodosimetry results. Whereas optically opaque actinometers such as 
KI/KIO3 are not directly capable of predicting the fluence of reflecting 
reactors, the results of uridine actinometry are influenced by reflection and 
transmission. To precisely predict the fluence rate in UV reactors with uridine, 
knowledge about the effective optical path length of the light is needed. Here, 
an existing method to mathematically calculate the optical path length was 
adopted and optimized for uridine actinometry. Results for average fluence were 
validated by biodosimetry using MS2 phages under different degrees of reflection 
and transmission. It could be shown that by modifying the bottom of the reactor 
with diffusely reflecting polytetrafluoroethylene foil, the fluence rate was 
increased by a factor of approximately 2.6 and the path length by factor of 2.4. 
When only half of the bottom was covered with reflective foil, fluence rate 
increased by a factor of 1.8 and path length by 1.8. Although this new approach 
cannot replace biodosimetry, to predict the fluence distribution received by 
microorganisms, it can provide means to characterize more complex reactor 
designs, validate results of advanced reactor modeling, and quantify fluence for 
non-parallel irradiation and reflective light, especially for the application of 
high fluence (e.g., advanced oxidation processes), where biodosimetry may be too 
sensitive. Further, comparing the fluence obtained with actinometry to the 
results of biodosimetry might qualitatively indicate hydraulic short cuts or 
unideal fluence distributions for flow-through reactors.

Suitable controls are integral for the validation and continued quality 
assurance of diagnostic workflows. Plasmids, DNA, or in vitro transcribed RNA 
are often used to validate novel diagnostic workflows, however, they are poorly 
representative of clinical samples. RNA phage virus-like particles (VLPs) 
packaged with exogenous RNA have been used in clinical diagnostics as workflow 
controls, serving as surrogates for infectious viral particles. Comparable 
controls for DNA viruses are more challenging to produce, with analogous DNA 
phages being infectious and packaging of DNA within RNA phages requiring complex 
purification procedures and expensive chemical linkers. We present a simple and 
inexpensive method to produce Emesvirus zinderi (MS2) VLPs, packaged with DNA, 
that makes use of affinity chromatography for purification and enzymatic 
production of exogenous DNA suitable for packaging. The produced VLPs were 
packaged with hepatitis B virus DNA and were then quantified using droplet 
digital PCR and calibrated against the WHO international standard using a 
commercial assay in an accredited clinical laboratory.

Atmospheric pressure dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma is an emerging 
technique for effective bioaerosol decontamination and is promising to be used 
in indoor environments to reduce infections. However, fundamental knowledge of 
the dose and dose-response characteristics of plasma-based disinfection 
technology is very limited. By examining the single-pass removal efficiency of 
S. lentus aerosol by in-duct grating-like DBD plasma reactors with varied 
discharge setups (gap distance, electrode size, number of discharge layers, 
frequency, dielectric material), it was found that the specific input energy 
(SIE) could be served as the dose for disinfection, and the efficiency was 
exponentially dependent on SIE in most cases. The corresponding susceptibility 
constants (Z values) were obtained hereinafter. Humidity was a prominent factor 
boosting the efficiency with a Z value of 0.36 L/J at relative humidity (RH) of 
20% and 1.68 L/J at RH of 60%. MS2 phage showed a much higher efficiency of 
2.66-3.08 log10 of reduction than those of S. lentus (38-85%) and E. coli 
(42%-95%) under the same condition. Using SIE as the dose, the performance of 
plasma reactors in the literature was compared and evaluated. This work provides 
a theoretical and engineering basis for air disinfection by plasma-based 
technology.

Given the possibility that food contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 might become an 
infection source, there is an urgent need for us to develop a rapid and accurate 
nucleic acid detection method for SARS-CoV-2 in food to ensure food safety. 
Here, we propose a sensitive, specific, and reliable molecular detection method 
for SARS-CoV-2. It has a mechanism to control amplicon contamination. Swabs from 
spiked frozen shrimps were used as detection samples, which were processed by 
heating at 95 °C for 30 s. These preprocessed samples served as the templates 
for subsequent amplification. A colorimetric LAMP reaction was carried out to 
amplify both the SARS-CoV-2 target and the MS2 phage simultaneously in one tube. 
MS2 phage was detected by colorimetric LAMP as the internal control, while 
SARS-CoV-2 was detected with a CRISPR/Cas12a system. The fluorescence results 
could be visually detected with an ultraviolet lamp. Meanwhile, uracil was 
incorporated during the LAMP reaction to provide an amplicon contamination proof 
mechanism. This test could detect as low as 20 copies of SARS-CoV-2 in one 
reaction. Additionally, the detection could be finished in 45 min. The test only 
needs a heating block and an ultraviolet lamp, which shows the potential for 
field detection.

Witnessed by the ongoing spread of antimicrobial resistant bacteria as well as 
the recent global pandemic of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the development of new 
disinfection strategies is of great importance, and novel substance classes as 
effective antimicrobials and virucides are urgently needed. Ionic liquids (ILs), 
low-melting salts, have been already recognized as efficient antimicrobial 
agents with prospects for antiviral potential. In this study, we examined the 
antiviral activity of 12 morpholinium based herbicidal ionic liquids with a 
tripartite test system, including enzyme inhibition tests, virucidal activity 
determination against five model viruses and activity against five bacterial 
species. The antimicrobial and enzymatic tests confirmed that the inhibiting 
activity of ILs corresponds with the number of long alkyl side chains and that 
[Dec2Mor]+ based ILs are promising candidates as novel antimicrobials. The 
virucidal tests showed that ILs antiviral activity depends on the type and 
structure of the virus, revealing enveloped Phi6 phage as highly susceptible to 
the ILs action, while the non-enveloped phages PRD1 and MS2 proved completely 
resistant to ionic liquids. Furthermore, a comparison of results obtained for 
P100 and P001 phages demonstrated for the first time that the susceptibility of 
viruses to ionic liquids can be dependent on differences in the phage tail 
structure.

Bacteriophages effectively counteract diverse bacterial infections, and their 
ability to treat most types of cancer has been explored using phage engineering 
or phage-virus hybrid platforms. In the present study, it was demonstrated that 
the bacteriophage MS2 can affect the expression of genes associated with the 
proliferation and survival of LNCaP prostate epithelial cells. LNCaP cells were 
exposed to bacteriophage MS2 at a concentration of 1×107 plaque forming units/ml 
for 24-48 h. After exposure, various cellular parameters, including cell 
viability, morphology, and changes in gene expression, were examined. MS2 
affected cell viability adversely, reducing viability by 25% in the first 4 h of 
treatment; however, cell viability recovered within 24-48 h. Similarly, the AKT, 
androgen receptor, integrin α5, integrin β1, MAPK1, MAPK3, STAT3, and peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α genes, which are involved in 
various normal cellular processes and tumor progression, were significantly 
upregulated, whereas the expression levels of HSP90, ITGB5, ITGB3, HSP27, ITGAV, 
and PI3K genes were unchanged. Therefore, based on viability and gene expression 
changes, bacteriophage MS2 severely impaired LNCaP cells by reducing 
anchorage-dependent survival and androgen signaling. A caveolin-mediated 
endocytosis mechanism for MS2-mediated signaling in prostate cancer cells was 
proposed based on reports involving bacteriophages T4, M13, and MS2, and their 
interactions with LNCaP and PC3 cell lines.

Unhealable diabetic wounds need to be addressed with the help of newer, more 
efficacious strategies. Exosomes combined with biomaterials for sustained 
delivery of therapeutic agents are expected to bring new hope for chronic wound 
treatment. Here, the engineered exosomes modified for efficiently loading 
miR146a and attaching to silk fibroin patch (SFP) were demonstrated to promote 
diabetic wound healing. Silk fibroin binding peptide (SFBP) was screened through 
phage display, and SFBP-Gluc-MS2 (SGM) and pac-miR146a-pac fusion protein were 
constructed. The designed exosomes (SGM-Exos, miR146a-Exos, and 
SGM-miR146a-Exos) were isolated from the engineered placental mesenchymal stem 
cells (PMSCs) transduced with SGM or/and pac-miR146a-pac protein. Gluc signals 
indicated SGM-Exo@SFP markedly increased the binding rate and the stability of 
SGM-Exo. Moreover, the loading efficiency of miR146a in SGM-miR146a-Exos was 
ten-fold higher than that in miR146a-Exos. Superior to untreated, 
SGM-miR146a-Exo-only treated, and SFP-only treated groups, SGM-miR146a-Exo@SFP 
drived wound healing associated with less inflammation, collagen deposition, and 
neovascularization. The transcriptomics analysis suggested anti-inflammatory and 
regenerative effects with SGM-miR146a-Exo@SFP treatment. Here, we show efficient 
exosome@biomaterial-based miRNA delivery systems for regenerative medicine and 
tissue engineering.

The objective of this study is to explore the effects of microplastics on the 
viability of the bacteriophages in an aqueous environment. Bacteriophages 
(phages), that is, viruses of bacteria, are essential in homeostasis. It is 
estimated that phages cause up to 40% of the death of all bacteria daily. Any 
factor affecting phage activity is vital for the whole food chain and the 
ecology of numerous niches. We hypothesize that the number of active phages 
decreases due to the virions' adsorption on microplastic particles or by the 
released leachables from additives used in the production of plastic, for 
example, stabilizers, plasticizers, colorants, and reinforcements. We exposed 
three diverse phages, namely, T4 (tailed), MS2 (icosahedral), and M13 
(filamentous), to 1 mg/mL suspension of 12 industrial-grade plastics 
[acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, high-impact polystyrene, poly-ε-caproamide, 
polycarbonate, polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, poly(methyl 
methacrylate), polypropylene, polystyrene, polytetrafluoroethylene, 
polyurethane, and polyvinyl chloride] shredded to obtain microparticles of 
radius ranging from 2 to 50 μm. The effect of leachables was measured upon 
exposure of phages not to particles themselves but to the buffer preincubated 
with microplastics. A double-overlay plaque counting method was used to assess 
phage titers. We employed a classical linear regression model to verify which 
physicochemical parameters (65 variables were tested) govern the decrease of 
phage titers. The key finding is that adsorption mechanisms result in up to 
complete scavenging of virions, whereas leachables deactivate up to 50% of 
phages. This study reveals microplastic pollution's plausible and unforeseen 
ecotoxicological effect causing phage deactivation. Moreover, phage transmission 
through adsorption can alter the balance of the food chain in the new 
environment. The effect depends mainly on the zeta potentials of the polymers 
and the phage type.

High levels of viruses can be found in human excrement from infected 
individuals, a fraction of which can be emitted from toilet flushing. Unlike the 
common mix flush toilet (MFT), the urine-diverting toilet (UDT) separates urine 
from the toilet water. Specific focus on urine-associated viruses is needed 
because the UDT can emit different levels of urine-associated and fecal-borne 
viruses and urine has different properties compared to feces that can affect 
emission levels (e.g., protein content). In this work, we quantified emission 
levels of surrogate bacteriophages for urine-associated and fecal-borne viruses, 
MS2 and T3, from flushing a UDT and an MFT, with and without protein in the 
water. Emission levels of viruses in the water of the UDT were lower than that 
of the MFT by up to 1.2-log10 and 1.3-log10 for T3 and MS2, respectively. If 
urine is completely diverted in the UDT, virus emissions can be reduced by up to 
4-log10. Based on these results and typical levels in urine and feces, we 
estimate that up to 107 and 108 gene copies of human viruses per flush can be 
released from the UDT and MFT, respectively. Lower emissions observed with the 
UDT suggest reduced exposure to viruses from flushing the UDT.

Grignard Pure (GP) is a unique and proprietary blend of triethylene glycol (TEG) 
and inert ingredients designed for continuous antimicrobial treatment of air. 
TEG has been designated as a ″Safer Chemical" by the US EPA. GP has already 
received approval from the US EPA under its Section 18 Public Health Emergency 
Exemption program for use in seven states. This study characterizes the efficacy 
of GP for inactivating MS2 bacteriophage─a nonenveloped virus widely used as a 
surrogate for SARS-CoV-2. Experiments measured the decrease in airborne viable 
MS2 concentration in the presence of different concentrations of GP from 60 to 
90 min, accounting for both natural die-off and settling of MS2. Experiments 
were conducted both by introducing GP aerosol into air containing MS2 and by 
introducing airborne MS2 into air containing GP aerosol. GP is consistently able 
to rapidly reduce viable MS2 bacteriophage concentration by 2-3 logs at GP 
concentrations of 0.04-0.5 mg/m3 (corresponding to TEG concentrations of 0.025 
to 0.287 mg/m3). Related GP efficacy experiments by the US EPA, as well as GP 
(TEG) safety and toxicology, are also discussed.

The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has emphasized the need for a deeper understanding of 
infectivity, spread, and treatment of airborne viruses. Bacteriophages (phages) 
serve as ideal surrogates for respiratory pathogenic viruses thanks to their 
high tractability and the structural similarities tailless phages bear to viral 
pathogens. However, the aerosolization of enveloped SARS-CoV-2 surrogate phi6 
usually results in a >3-log10 reduction in viability, limiting its usefulness as 
a surrogate for aerosolized coronavirus in "real world" contexts, such as a 
sneeze or cough. Recent work has shown that saliva or artificial saliva greatly 
improves the stability of viruses in aerosols and microdroplets relative to 
standard dilution/storage buffers like suspension medium (SM) buffer. These 
findings led us to investigate whether we could formulate media that preserves 
the viability of phi6 and other phages in artificially derived aerosols. Results 
indicate that SM buffer supplemented with bovine serum albumin (BSA) 
significantly improves the recovery of airborne phi6, MS2, and 80α and 
outperforms commercially formulated artificial saliva. Particle sizing and 
acoustic particle trapping data indicate that BSA supplementation 
dose-dependently improves viral survivability by reducing the extent of particle 
evaporation. These data suggest that our viral preservation medium may 
facilitate a lower-cost alternative to artificial saliva for future applied 
aerobiology studies. IMPORTANCE We have identified common and inexpensive lab 
reagents that confer increased aerosol survivability on phi6 and other phages. 
Our results suggest that soluble protein is a key protective component in 
nebulizing medium. Protein supplementation likely reduces exposure of the phage 
to the air-water interface by reducing the extent of particle evaporation. These 
findings will be useful for applications in which researchers wish to improve 
the survivability of these (and likely other) aerosolized viruses to better 
approximate highly transmissible airborne viruses like SARS-CoV-2.

Bacteriophage-based applications have a renaissance today, increasingly marking 
their use in industry, medicine, food processing, biotechnology, and more. 
However, phages are considered resistant to various harsh environmental 
conditions; besides, they are characterized by high intra-group variability. 
Phage-related contaminations may therefore pose new challenges in the future due 
to the wider use of phages in industry and health care. Therefore, in this 
review, we summarize the current knowledge of bacteriophage disinfection 
methods, as well as highlight new technologies and approaches. We discuss the 
need for systematic solutions to improve bacteriophage control, taking into 
account their structural and environmental diversity.

Frozen berries have been repeatedly linked to acute gastroenteritis caused by 
norovirus, the most common cause of foodborne illness in the United States. Many 
guidelines recommend that frozen berries be microwaved for at least 2 min, but 
it is unclear if this thermal treatment is effective at inactivating norovirus. 
The objective of this study was to model the effect of microwave heating at 
varying power levels on the survival of bacteriophage MS2, a norovirus 
surrogate, when inoculated onto frozen strawberries. Bacteriophage MS2 was 
inoculated onto the surface of frozen strawberries with a starting concentration 
of approximately 10 log PFU/g. Samples (either 3 or 5 whole strawberries) were 
heated in a 1300-Watt domestic research microwave oven (frequency of 2450 MHz) 
at power levels of 30, 50, 70, and 100% (full power), for times ranging from 15 
to 300 s to determine inactivation. Temperatures at berry surfaces were 
monitored during heating using fiberoptic thermometry. All experiments were 
conducted in triplicate. The primary model for thermal inactivation was a 
log-linear model of logN vs. time. The secondary model was for a D-value 
decreasing linearly with temperature and an added term that was path-dependent 
on the thermal history. Parameters in the model were estimated using dynamic 
temperature history at the surface of the berry, via nonlinear regression using 
all data simultaneously. The root mean square error was ∼0.5 PFU/g out of a 
total 6-log reduction. Log reductions of 1.1 ± 0.4, 1.5 ± 0.5, 3.1 ± 0.1, and 
3.8 ± 0.2 log PFU/g were observed for 30, 50, 70, and 100% microwave power 
levels when three berries were heated for 60 s. D-values were 21.4 ± 1.95 s and 
10.6 ± 1.1 s at 10 and 60°C, respectively. This work demonstrates an approach to 
estimate inactivation parameters for viruses from dynamic temperature data 
during microwave heating. These findings will be useful in predicting the safety 
effect of microwave heating of berries in the home or food service.

Microbial safety in water has always been the focus of attention, especially 
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Development of green, efficient and safe 
disinfection technology is the key to control the spread of pathogenic 
microorganisms. Here, an in situ aquatic electrode KrCl excimer radiation with 
main emission wavelength 222 nm (UV222) was designed and used to disinfect model 
waterborne virus and bacteria, i.e. phage MS2, E. coli and S. aureus. High 
inactivation efficacy and diversity of inactivation mechanisms of UV222 were 
proved by comparision with those of commercial UV254. UV222 could totally 
inactivate MS2, E. coli and S. aureus with initial concentrations of ∼107 PFU or 
CFU mL-1 within 20, 15, and 36 mJ/cm2, respectively. The UV dose required by 
UV254 to inactivate the same logarithmic pathogenic microorganism is at least 
twice that of UV222. The protein, genomic and cell membrane irreparable damage 
contributed to the microbial inactivation by UV222, but UV254 only act on 
nucleic acid of the target microorganisms. We found that UV222 damage nucleic 
acid with almost the same or even higher efficacy with UV254. In addition, free 
base damage of UV222 in similar ways with UV254(dimer and hydrate). But due to 
the quantum yield of free base degradation of UV222 was greater than UV254, the 
photolysis rates of UV222 to A, G, C and U four bases were 11.5, 1.2, 3.2 and 1 
times as those of UV254, respectively. Excellent disinfection performance in 
UV222 irradiation was also achieved in real water matrices (WWTP and Lake). In 
addition, it was proved that coexisting HCO3- or HPO42 - in real and synthetic 
water matrices can produce • OH to promote UV222 disinfection. This study 
provided novel insight into the UV222 disinfection process and demonstrated its 
possibility to take place of the conventional ultraviolet mercury lamp in water 
purification.

Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are widespread in bacteria and archaea plasmids and 
genomes to regulate DNA replication, gene transcription, or protein translation. 
Higher eukaryotic and prokaryotic nucleotide-binding (HEPN) and minimal 
nucleotidyltransferase (MNT) domains are prevalent in prokaryotic genomes and 
constitute TA pairs. However, three gene pairs (MTH304/305, 408/409, and 
463/464) of Methanothermobacter thermautotropicus ΔH HEPN-MNT family have not 
been studied as TA systems. Among these candidates, our study characterizes the 
MTH463/MTH464 TA system. MTH463 expression inhibited Escherichia coli growth, 
whereas MTH464 did not and blocked MTH463 instead. Using site-directed MTH463 
mutagenesis, we determined that amino acids R99G, H104A, and Y106A from the 
R[ɸX]4-6H motif are involved with MTH463 cell toxicity. Furthermore, we 
established that purified MTH463 could degrade MS2 phage RNA, whereas purified 
MTH464 neutralized MTH463 activity in vitro. Our results indicate that the 
endonuclease toxin MTH463 (encoding a HEPN domain) and its cognate antitoxin 
MTH464 (encoding the MNT domain) may act as a type II TA system in M. 
thermautotropicus ΔH. This study provides initial and essential information 
studying TA system functions, primarily archaea HEPN-MNT family.

BACKGROUND: Handwashing is an important intervention which can reduce indirect 
disease transmission, however soap and water for handwashing purposes is not 
available in some low-resource regions. When handwashing with soap and water is 
not possible, individuals may use alternatives such as the Supertowel (a 
microfiber towel with an antimicrobial coating). Testing of viral inactivation 
as a result of antimicrobial treatment on the Supertowel, however, has been 
limited. The goal of this study is to provide information about the performance 
of the Supertowel's antimicrobial treatment against viruses, which will help 
inform the use of the towels as handwashing alternatives.
METHODS: We seeded the Supertowel and a regular microfiber towel with two 
bacteriophages (enveloped Phi6 and non-enveloped MS2) and monitored viral 
inactivation over time. Additionally, we assessed if temperature, humidity, 
whether the towel was initially wet or dry, or virus type had an effect on viral 
decay rate constants. Virus concentrations were measured repeatedly over 24 h.
RESULTS: We found that neither towel type (whether the towel was a Supertowel or 
a regular microfiber towel) nor humidity were significant variables in our model 
of decay rate constants (P = 0.06 and P = 0.22, respectively). We found that the 
variables of temperature, whether towels were initially wet versus dry, and 
virus type were significantly different from 0, suggesting that these variables 
explained variance in the decay rate constant (P = 6.55 × 10-13, P = 0.001, and 
P < 2 × 10-16, respectively). Higher temperatures, dry towels, and enveloped 
viruses all resulted in increases in the decay rate constant.
CONCLUSIONS: Viruses seeded onto a Supertowel decay similar to viruses seeded 
onto a regular towel indicating that the virucidal potential of the Supertowel 
is minimal.

Cell-free genetically encoded biosensors have been developed to detect small 
molecules and nucleic acids, but they have yet to be reliably engineered to 
detect proteins. Here we develop an automated platform to convert 
protein-binding RNA aptamers into riboswitch sensors that operate within 
low-cost cell-free assays. We demonstrate the platform by engineering 35 
protein-sensing riboswitches for human monomeric C-reactive protein, human 
interleukin-32γ, and phage MS2 coat protein. The riboswitch sensors regulate 
output expression levels by up to 16-fold with input protein concentrations 
within the human serum range. We identify two distinct mechanisms governing 
riboswitch-mediated regulation of translation rates and leverage computational 
analysis to refine the protein-binding aptamer regions, improving design 
accuracy. Overall, we expand the cell-free sensor toolbox and demonstrate how 
computational design is used to develop protein-sensing riboswitches with future 
applications as low-cost medical diagnostics.

Microfiltration (MF) has been widely adopted as an advanced treatment process to 
reduce suspended solids and turbidity in treated wastewater effluents designated 
for potable reuse. Although microfilter pores are much larger than viruses, the 
addition of a coagulant upstream of a microfilter system can achieve stable 
virus removal. Ceramic membranes have a narrow pore size distribution to achieve 
the high removal of contaminants. This study aims to evaluate virus log 
reduction using bench-scale coagulation and ceramic membrane MF. To investigate 
the effects of differences in net surface hydrophobicity, 18 sewage-derived 
F-specific RNA phages (FRNAPHs) were used for batch hydrophobicity and 
coagulation-MF tests. The capability of bench-scale coagulation and ceramic 
membrane MF under continuous automated long-term operation was tested to remove 
the lab reference strain MS2 and three selected FRNAPH isolates which varied by 
surface property. Median virus log reduction values (LRVs) exceeding 6.2 were 
obtained for all three isolates and MS2. Although coagulation and hydrophobicity 
were positively correlated, the virus isolate demonstrating the lowest level of 
hydrophobicity and coagulation (genogroup I) still exhibited a high LRV. Thus, 
coagulation and ceramic membrane MF systems may serve as viable options for 
virus removal during water reclamation and advanced treatment.

Titanium suboxides (TSO) are identified as a series of compounds showing 
excellent electro- and photo-chemical properties. TSO composites with 
carbon-based materials such as graphene have further improved water splitting 
and pollutant removal performance. However, their expensive and multi-step 
synthesis limits their wide-scale use. Furthermore, recently discovered 
laser-induced graphene (LIG) is a single-step and low-cost fabrication of 
graphene-based composites. Moreover, LIG's highly electrically conductive 
surface aids in tremendous environmental applications, including bacterial 
inactivation, anti-biofouling, and pollutant sensing. Here, we demonstrate the 
single-step in-situ fabrication of TSO-LIG composite by directly scribing the 
TiO2 mixed poly(ether) sulfone sheets using a CO2 infrared laser. In contrast, 
earlier composites were derived from either commercial-grade TSO or synthesized 
TSO with graphene in multi step processes. The characteristic Ti3+ peaks in XPS 
confirmed the conversion of TiO2 into its sub-stoichiometric form, enhancing the 
electro-catalytical properties of the LIG-TiOx composite surface. 
Electrochemical characterization, including impedance spectroscopy, validated 
the surface's enhanced electrochemical activity and electrode stability. 
Furthermore, the LIG-TiOx composite surfaces were tested for anti-biofouling 
action and electrochemical application as electrodes and filters. The composite 
electrodes exhibit enhanced degradation performance for removing emerging 
pollutant antibiotics ciprofloxacin and methylene blue due to the in-situ 
hydroxyl radical generation. Additionally, the LIG-TiOx conductive filters 
showed the complete 6-log killing of mixed bacterial culture and MS2 phage virus 
in flow-through filtration mode at 2.5 V, which is ∼2.5-log more killing 
compared to non-composited LIG filers at 500 Lm-2h-1. Nevertheless, these 
cost-effective LIG-TiOx composites have excellent electrical properties and can 
be effectively utilized for energy and environmental applications.

Ultraviolet (UV) radiation systems, commonly used to disinfect surfaces, 
drinking water, and air, stem from historical practice to use sunlight to 
disinfect household items after contagious illness. Currently, it is still 
recommended in viral outbreak contexts such as COVID-19, Ebola, and Marburg to 
expose soft surfaces to sunlight after washing with detergent or disinfecting 
with chlorine. However, sunlight that reaches the Earth's surface is in the 
UVA/UVB wavelengths, whereas UV disinfection systems typically rely on biocidal 
UVC. Our goal was to fill the evidence gap on the efficacy of sunlight 
disinfection on surface materials common in low-resource healthcare settings by 
seeding four surfaces (stainless steel, nitrile, tarp, cloth) with three 
microorganisms (viral surrogate bacteriophages Phi6 and MS2 and Escherichia coli 
bacteria), with and without soil load, and exposing to three sunlight conditions 
(full sun, partial sun, cloudy). We conducted 144 tests in triplicate and found: 
solar radiation averaged 737 W/m2 (SD = 333), 519 W/m2 (SD = 65), and 149 W/m2 
(SD = 24) for full sun, partial sun, and cloudy conditions; significantly more 
surfaces averaged ≥ 4 log10 reduction value (LRV) for Phi6 than MS2 and E. coli 
(P < 0.001) after full sun exposure, and no samples achieved ≥ 4 LRV for partial 
sun or cloudy conditions. On the basis of our results, we recommend no change to 
current protocols of disinfecting materials first with a 0.5% chlorine solution 
then moving to sunlight to dry. Additional field-based research is recommended 
to understand sunlight disinfection efficacy against pathogenic organisms on 
healthcare relevant surfaces during actual outbreak contexts.

The pursuit of disinfecting porous materials or fomites to inactivate viral 
agents has special challenges. To address these challenges, a highly portable 
chlorine dioxide (ClO2) gas generation system was used to ascertain the ability 
of a gaseous preparation to inactivate a viral agent, the MS2 bacteriophage, 
when associated with potentially porous fomites of cloth, paper towel, and wood. 
The MS2 bacteriophage is increasingly used as a model to identify means of 
inactivating infectious viral agents of significance to humans. Studies showed 
that MS2 bacteriophage can be applied to and subsequently recovered from 
potential porous fomites such as cloth, paper towel, and wood. Paired with viral 
plaque assays, this provided a means for assessing the ability of gaseous ClO2 
to inactivate bacteriophage associated with the porous materials. Notable 
results include 100% inactivation of 6 log bacteriophage after overnight 
exposure to 20 parts per million(ppm) ClO2. Reducing exposure time to 90 minutes 
and gas ppm to lower concentrations proved to remain effective in bacteriophage 
elimination in association with porous materials. Stepwise reduction in gas 
concentration from 76 ppm to 5 ppm consistently resulted in greater than 99.99% 
to 100% reduction of recoverable bacteriophage. This model suggests the 
potential of ClO2 gas deployment systems for use in the inactivation of viral 
agents associated with porous potential fomites. The ClO2 gas could prove 
especially helpful in disinfecting enclosed areas containing viral contaminated 
surfaces, rather than manually spraying and wiping them.

RNA viruses are particularly notorious for their high levels of genetic 
diversity, which is generated through the forces of mutation and natural 
selection. However, disentangling these two forces is a considerable challenge, 
and this may lead to widely divergent estimates of viral mutation rates, as well 
as difficulties in inferring the fitness effects of mutations. Here, we develop, 
test, and apply an approach aimed at inferring the mutation rate and key 
parameters that govern natural selection, from haplotype sequences covering 
full-length genomes of an evolving virus population. Our approach employs neural 
posterior estimation, a computational technique that applies simulation-based 
inference with neural networks to jointly infer multiple model parameters. We 
first tested our approach on synthetic data simulated using different mutation 
rates and selection parameters while accounting for sequencing errors. 
Reassuringly, the inferred parameter estimates were accurate and unbiased. We 
then applied our approach to haplotype sequencing data from a serial passaging 
experiment with the MS2 bacteriophage, a virus that parasites Escherichia coli. 
We estimated that the mutation rate of this phage is around 0.2 mutations per 
genome per replication cycle (95% highest density interval: 0.051-0.56). We 
validated this finding with two different approaches based on single-locus 
models that gave similar estimates but with much broader posterior 
distributions. Furthermore, we found evidence for reciprocal sign epistasis 
between four strongly beneficial mutations that all reside in an RNA stem loop 
that controls the expression of the viral lysis protein, responsible for lysing 
host cells and viral egress. We surmise that there is a fine balance between 
over- and underexpression of lysis that leads to this pattern of epistasis. To 
recap, we have developed an approach for joint inference of the mutation rate 
and selection parameters from full haplotype data with sequencing errors and 
used it to reveal features governing MS2 evolution.

The surface hydrophobicity of native or engineered non-enveloped viruses and 
virus-like particles (VLPs) is a key parameter regulating their fate in living 
and artificial aqueous systems. Its modulation is mainly depending on the 
structure and environment of particles. Nevertheless, unexplained variations 
have been reported between structurally similar viruses and with pH. This 
indicates that some modulating factors of their hydrophobicity remain to be 
identified. Herein we investigate the potential involvement of RNA cargo in the 
MS2 phage used as non-enveloped RNA virus model, by examining the SDS-induced 
electrophoretic mobility shift (SEMS) determined for native MS2 virions and 
corresponding RNA-free VLPs at various pH. Interestingly, the SEMS of VLPs was 
larger and more variable from pH 5 to 9 compared to native virions. These 
observations are discussed in term of RNA-dependent changes in surface 
hydrophobicity, suggesting that RNA cargo may be a major modulator/regulator of 
this viral parameter.

Air pollution is one of the top 5 risks causing chronic diseases according to 
WHO and airborne transmitted pathogens infection is a huge challenge in the 
current era. Long living pathogens and small size aerosols are not effectively 
dealt with by the available indoor air purifiers. In this work, a dielectric 
barrier discharge (DBD) based portable cold-plasma detergent in environment 
device is reported and its disinfection efficiency has been analyzed in the 
indoor environment of sizes up to 3 × 2.4 × 2.4 m3. The deactivation efficiency 
of total microbial counts (TMCs) and total fungal counts (TFCs) is found to be 
more than 99% in 90 min of continuous operation of the device at the optimized 
parameters. The complete inactivation of MS2 phage and Escherichia coli bacteria 
with more than 5 log reduction (99.999%) has also been achieved in 30 min and 
90 min of operation of the device in an enclosed environment. The device is able 
to produce negative ions predominantly dominated by natural plasma detergent 
along with positive ions in the environment similar to mother nature. The device 
comprises a coaxial DBD geometry plasma source with a specially designed wire 
mesh electrode of mild steel with a thickness of 1 mm. The need for feed gas, 
pellets and/or differential pressure has been eliminated from the DBD discharge 
source for efficient air purification. The existence of negative ions for more 
than 25 s on average is the key advantage, which can also deactivate long living 
pathogens and small size aerosols.

Pathogenic viruses (e.g., Enteroviruses, Noroviruses, Rotaviruses, and 
Adenovirus) present in wastewater, even at low concentrations, can cause serious 
waterborne diseases. Improving water treatment to enhance viral removal is of 
paramount significance, especially given the COVID-19 pandemic. This study 
incorporated microwave-enabled catalysis into membrane filtration and evaluated 
viral removal using a model bacteriophage (MS2) as a surrogate. Microwave 
irradiation effectively penetrated the PTFE membrane module and enabled surface 
oxidation reactions on the membrane-coated catalysts (i.e., BiFeO3), which thus 
elicited strong germicidal effects via local heating and radical formation as 
reported previously. A log removal of 2.6 was achieved for MS2 within a contact 
time as low as 20 s using 125-W microwave irradiation with the initial MS2 
concentration of 105 PFU∙mL-1. By contrast, almost no inactivation could be 
achieved without microwave irradiation. COMSOL simulation indicates that the 
catalyst surface could be heated up to 305 oC with 125-W microwave irradiation 
for 20 s and also analyzed microwave penetration into catalyst or water film 
layers. This research provides new insights to the antiviral mechanisms of this 
microwave-enabled catalytic membrane filtration.

Deep sequence-coupled biopanning (DSCB) is a powerful tool that couples affinity 
selection of a bacteriophage MS2 virus-like particle peptide display platform 
with deep sequencing. While this approach has been used successfully to 
investigate pathogen-specific antibody responses in human sera, data analysis is 
time-consuming and complicated. Here, we describe a streamlined data analysis 
method for DSCB using MATLAB, expanding the potential for this approach to be 
deployed rapidly and consistently.

Detection of viable viruses in the air is critical in order to determine the 
level of risk associated with the airborne diffusion of viruses. Different 
methods have been developed for the isolation, purification, and detection of 
viable airborne viruses, but they require an extensive processing time and often 
present limitations including low physical efficiency (i.e., the amount of 
collected viruses), low biological efficiency (i.e., the number of viable 
viruses), or a combination of all. To mitigate such limitations, we have 
employed an efficient technique based on the magnetic levitation (Maglev) 
technique with a paramagnetic solution and successfully identified distinct 
variations in levitation and density characteristics among bacteria (Escherichia 
coli), phages (MS2), and human viruses (SARS-CoV-2 and influenza H1N1). Notably, 
the Maglev approach enabled a significant enrichment of viable airborne viruses 
in air samples. Furthermore, the enriched viruses obtained through Maglev 
exhibited high purity, rendering them suitable for direct utilization in 
subsequent analyses such as reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR) or colorimetric assays. The system is portable, easy to use, and 
cost-efficient and can potentially provide proactive surveillance data for 
monitoring future outbreaks of airborne infectious diseases and allow for the 
induction of various preventative and mitigative measures.

The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in many supply chain issues, including crippling 
of essential personal protective equipment (PPE) needed for high-risk 
occupations such as those in healthcare. As a result of these supply chain 
issues, unprecedented crisis capacity strategies were implemented to divert PPE 
items such as filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs, namely N95s) to those who 
needed them most for protection. Large-scale methods for decontamination were 
used throughout the world to preserve these items and provided for their 
extended use. The general public also adopted the use of non-specialized 
protective equipment such as face coverings. So, the need for cleaning, 
decontamination, or disinfection of these items in addition to normal clothing 
items became a necessary reality. Some items could be laundered, but other items 
were not appropriate for washing/drying. To fill research gaps in small-scale, 
non-commercial cleaning and disinfection, this bench-scale research was 
conducted using small coupons (swatches) of multiple PPE/barrier protection 
materials inoculated with virus (non-pathogenic bacteriophages Phi6 and MS2) and 
tested against a range of decontamination methods including bleach-, alcohol- 
and quaternary ammonium compound (QAC)-based liquid sprays, as well as low 
concentration hydrogen peroxide vapor (LCHPV) and bench-scale laundering. In 
general, non-porous items were easier to disinfect than porous items, and the 
enveloped virus Phi6 was overall easier to inactivate than MS2. Multiple 
disinfection methods were shown to be effective in reducing viral loads from PPE 
coupons, though only laundering and LCHPV were effective for all materials 
tested that were inoculated with Phi6. Applications of this and follow-on 
full-scale research are to provide simple effective cleaning/disinfection 
methods for use during the current and future pandemics.

An open research field in cellular regulation is the assumed crosstalk between 
RNAs, metabolic enzymes, and metabolites, also known as the REM hypothesis. 
High-throughput assays have produced extensive interactome data with metabolic 
enzymes frequently found as hits, but only a few examples have been 
biochemically validated, with deficits especially in prokaryotes. Therefore, we 
rationally selected nineteen Escherichia coli enzymes from such datasets and 
examined their ability to bind RNAs using two complementary methods, iCLIP and 
SELEX. Found interactions were validated by EMSA and other methods. For most of 
the candidates, we observed no RNA binding (12/19) or a rather unspecific 
binding (5/19). Two of the candidates, namely glutamate-5-kinase (ProB) and 
quinone oxidoreductase (QorA), displayed specific and previously unknown binding 
to distinct RNAs. We concentrated on the interaction of QorA to the mRNA of 
yffO, a grounded prophage gene, which could be validated by EMSA and MST. 
Because the physiological function of both partners is not known, the biological 
relevance of this interaction remains elusive. Furthermore, we found novel RNA 
targets for the MS2 phage coat protein that served us as control. Our results 
indicate that RNA binding of metabolic enzymes in procaryotes is less frequent 
than suggested by the results of high-throughput studies, but does occur.

Administration, 6502 S. Archer Rd, Bedford Park, IL 60501, USA.

AIMS: Viral diseases can be indirectly transmitted by contaminated non-food 
contact surfaces to final food products by cross-contamination. The interaction 
of metal surfaces and viruses, MS2 coliphage and hepatitis A virus (HAV), was 
investigated for strategy development in decreasing this transmission risk.
METHODS AND RESULTS: MS2 deposited onto stainless-steel surface was stable but 
inactivated at 0.95 log10 PFU min-1 on 99.9% copper surfaces. Greater 
copper-inactivation of MS2 was observed in (a) simple media (phosphate buffered 
saline, PBS) than protein-rich media (beef extract buffer), and (b) acidic than 
pH ≥ 6.8 environments. Among food matrices (strawberry juices and beef broth), 
the greatest MS2 inactivation by copper occurred in filtered strawberry juice at 
pH 3.5. At a reduction of 0.17 log10 PFU min-1, HAV survived longer than MS2 on 
copper by FRhK-4 cell infectivity assay.
CONCLUSIONS: The inactivation of virus on copper surfaces was greater in acidic 
viral surrounding environments and in simple PBS medium. In the same 99% PBS 
medium, MS2 may not be an appropriate surrogate for HAV when assessing viral 
inactivation on copper surfaces.

The persistence of pathogenic microorganisms in treated wastewater effluent 
makes disinfection crucial to achieve wastewater reuse. Membrane processes such 
as ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis (RO) have shown promising results for 
virus and other contaminant removal from treated wastewater effluents for reuse 
application. However, RO produces a concentrate stream which contains high 
concentrations of pathogens and contaminants that often requires treatment and 
volume reduction before disposal. Membrane distillation (MD) is a treatment 
process that can reduce RO concentrate volume while augmenting the potable water 
supply. MD is also a dual barrier approach for virus removal as it operates at a 
high temperature and permeates only the vapor phase through the membrane 
interface. The effects of temperature on viable virus concentration and membrane 
rejection of viruses in MD are investigated in this study using two nonenveloped 
phages frequently used as enteric virus surrogates (MS2 and PhiX174) and an 
enveloped pathogenic virus (HCoV-229E). At typical MD operating temperatures 
(greater than 65 °C), viable concentrations of all three viruses were reduced by 
thermal inactivation by more than 6-log10 for MS2 and PhiX174 and more than 
3-log10 for HCoV-229E. Also, membrane rejection was greater than 6-log10 for MS2 
and PhiX174 and greater than 2.5-log10 for HCoV-229E.

Initial recommendations for surface disinfection to prevent SARS-CoV-2 
transmission were developed using previous evidence from potential surrogates. 
To the best of our knowledge, no appropriate surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 has been 
identified or confirmed for chlorine and antimicrobial surface disinfection. We 
completed a study to evaluate the efficacy of two hypothesized antimicrobial 
surfaces, and four chlorine solutions on nonporous and porous surfaces, against 
SARS-CoV-2 and three potential SARS-CoV-2 surrogates [coronavirus mouse 
hepatitis virus (MHV) and bacteriophages Phi6 and MS2], to identify a BSL-1 or 
BSL-2 virus to use in future studies. We found SARS-CoV-2 can be reduced >4 
log10 on porous and nonporous surfaces within 30 s upon exposure to 0.5% NaOCl. 
The results indicate coronavirus MHV-GFP is inactivated faster than SARS-CoV-2 
(MHV-GFP ≥ 6.08 log10; SARS-CoV-2 = 0.66 log10 at 30 s with 0.05% NaOCl on 
steel) and MS2 is inactivated more slowly. Phi6 is inactivated like SARS-CoV-2, 
and we propose Phi6 as a slightly conservative surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 chlorine 
disinfection. Additionally, disinfection of bacteriophages on wood was 
challenging, and exposure to antimicrobial surfaces had no disinfection efficacy 
as tested. We recommend using 0.5% chlorine on surfaces for a minimum of 30 s of 
contact to disinfect SARS-CoV-2 and recommend additional research on Phi6 
disinfection with varied surfaces and conditions.

AIMS: To provide an alternative to ultra violet light and vapourized hydrogen 
peroxide to enhance decontamination of surfaces as part of the response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed an indirect method for in situ delivery of 
cold plasma and evaluated the anti-viral activity of plasma-activated mist (PAM) 
using bacteriophages phi6, MS2, and phiX174, surrogates for SARS-CoV-2. Exposure 
to ambient air atmospheric pressure derived PAM caused a 1.71 log10 PFU ml-1 
reduction in phi6 titer within 5 min and a 7.4 log10 PFU ml-1 reduction after 
10 min when the the PAM source was at 5 and 10 cm. With MS2 and phiX174, a 3.1 
and 1.26 log10 PFU ml-1 reduction was achieved, respectively, after 30 min. The 
rate of killing was increased with longer exposure times but decreased when the 
PAM source was further away. Trace amounts of reactive species, hydrogen 
peroxide and nitrite were produced in the PAM, and the anti-viral activity was 
probably attributable to these and their secondary reactive species.
CONCLUSIONS: PAM exhibits virucidal activity against surrogate viruses for 
COVID-19, which is time and distance from the plasma source dependent.

Lytic phages can be potent and selective inhibitors of microbial growth and can 
have profound impacts on microbiome composition and function. However, there is 
uncertainty about the biogeochemical conditions under which phage predation 
modulates microbial ecosystem function, particularly in terrestrial systems. 
Ionic strength is critical for infection of bacteria by many phages, but 
quantitative data is limited on the ion thresholds for phage infection that can 
be compared with environmental ion concentrations. Similarly, while carbon 
composition varies in the environment, we do not know how this variability 
influences the impact of phage predation on microbiome function. Here, we 
measured the half-maximal effective concentrations (EC50) of 80 different 
inorganic ions for the infection of E. coli with two canonical dsDNA and ssRNA 
phages, T4 and MS2, respectively. Many alkaline earth metals and alkali metals 
enabled lytic infection but the ionic strength thresholds varied for different 
ions between phages. Additionally, using a freshwater nitrate-reducing 
microbiome, we found that the ability of lytic phages to influence nitrate 
reduction end-products depended upon the carbon source as well as ionic 
strength. For all phage:host pairs, the ion EC50s for phage infection exceeded 
the ion concentrations found in many terrestrial freshwater systems. Thus, our 
findings support a model where phages most influence terrestrial microbial 
functional ecology in hot spots and hot moments such as metazoan guts, drought 
influenced soils, or biofilms where ion concentration is locally or transiently 
elevated and nutrients are available to support the growth of specific phage 
hosts.

Despite the widespread adoption of wastewater surveillance, more research is 
needed to understand the fate and transport of viral genetic markers in 
wastewater. This information is essential for optimizing monitoring strategies 
and interpreting wastewater surveillance data. In this study, we examined the 
solid-liquid partitioning behavior of four viruses in wastewater: SARS-CoV-2, 
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), and F+ coliphage/MS2. We 
used two approaches: (1) laboratory partitioning experiments using lab-grown 
viruses and (2) distribution experiments using endogenous viruses in raw 
wastewater. Partition experiments were conducted at 4 and 22 °C. Wastewater 
samples were spiked with varying concentrations of each virus, solids and 
liquids were separated via centrifugation, and viral RNA concentrations were 
quantified using reverse-transcription-digital droplet PCR (RT-ddPCR). For the 
distribution experiments, wastewater samples were collected from six wastewater 
treatment plants and processed without spiking exogenous viruses; viral RNA 
concentrations were measured in wastewater solids and liquids. In both 
experiments, RNA concentrations were higher in the solid fraction than the 
liquid fraction by approximately 3-4 orders of magnitude. Partition coefficients 
(KF) ranged from 2000-270,000 mL·g-1 across viruses and temperature conditions. 
Distribution coefficients (Kd) were consistent with results from partitioning 
experiments. Further research is needed to understand how virus and wastewater 
characteristics might influence the partitioning of viral genetic markers in 
wastewater.

Since 2020, there is a new European Regulation (EU, 2020/741) on minimum 
requirements for water reuse, where routine and validation monitoring 
requirements (log reductions of indicator microorganisms and reference 
pathogens) have been established. Many reclamation facilities that are already 
in operation might have difficulties to comply with these performance targets. 
Existing disinfection systems must be expanded and upgraded. In the case of UV 
disinfection systems, fluence requirements must be determined to properly design 
with a focus on the safety and economic-environmental viability of reclaimed 
water. This study can be used as a reference to develop fluence-response curves 
for Clostridium perfringens spores, Escherichia coli, and total and F-specific 
coliphages, indicator microorganisms referred to in the new European Regulation. 
Eight UV-LED collimated beam tests were performed. Samples were obtained from 
filtered effluent of secondary treatment from two wastewater treatment plants 
(WWTPs) which ranged between 30 and 54%. Results showed UV sensitivity of 33.46 
mJ/cm2 log I for C. perfringens spores and 2.86 mJ/cm2 log I for E. coli, both 
from environmental origin. Coliphages were inactivated below the limit of 
quantitation. The non-dominance of MS2 phages in environmental F-specific 
coliphages was observed.

Virus concentrations measured in municipal wastewater help inform both the water 
treatment necessary to protect human health and wastewater-based epidemiology. 
Wastewater measurements are typically PCR-based, and interpreting gene copy 
concentrations requires an understanding of the form and stability of the 
nucleic acids. Here, we study the persistence of model virus genomes in 
wastewater, the protective effects provided by the virus capsids, and the 
relative decay rates of the genome and infectious viruses. In benchtop batch 
experiments in wastewater influent at 25 °C, extraviral (+)ssRNA and dsDNA 
amplicons degraded by 90% within 15-19 min and 1.6-1.9 h, respectively. When 
encapsidated, the T90 for MS2 (+)ssRNA increased by 424× and the T90 for T4 
dsDNA increased by 52×. The (+)ssRNA decay rates were similar for a range of 
amplicon sizes. For our model phages MS2 and T4, the nucleic acid signal in 
untreated wastewater disappeared shortly after the viruses lost infectivity. 
Combined, these results suggest that most viral genome copies measured in 
wastewater are encapsidated, that measured concentrations are independent of 
assay amplicon sizes, and that the virus genome decay rates of nonenveloped 
(i.e., naked) viruses are similar to inactivation rates. These findings are 
valuable for the interpretation of wastewater virus measurements.

Accumulating evidences strongly support the correlations between the 
compositions of gut microbiome and therapeutic effects on Type 2 diabetes (T2D). 
Notably, gut microbes such as Akkermansia muciniphila are found able to regulate 
microecological balance and alleviate dysmetabolism of mice bearing T2D. In 
order to search out similarly functional bacteria, bacteriophage MS2 with a good 
specificity to bacteria carrying fertility (F) factor were used to treat T2D 
mice. Based on multi-omics analysis of microbiome and global metabolism of mice, 
we observed that gavage of bacteriophage MS2 and metformin led to a significant 
increase in the abundance of Corynebacterium glutamicum and A. muciniphila, 
respectively. Consequently, the gut microbiota were remodeled, leading to 
variations in metabolites and a substantial increase in short-chain fatty acids 
(SCFAs). In which, the amount of acetate, propionate, and butyrate presented 
negative correlations to that of proinflammatory cytokines, which was beneficial 
to repairing the intestinal barriers and improving their functions. Moreover, 
main short fatty acid (SCFA) producers exhibited positive interactions, further 
facilitating the restoration of gut eubiosis. These findings revealed that C. 
glutamicum and its metabolites may be potential dietary supplements for the 
treatment of T2D. Moreover, our research contributes to a novel understanding of 
the underlying mechanism by which functional foods exert their anti-diabetic 
effects.

This study evaluated the photobiocidal performance of four widely distributed 
visible-light-activated (VLA) dyes against two bacteria (Staphylococcus 
epidermidis and Escherichia coli) and two bacteriophages (phages MS2 and phi 6): 
rose bengal (RB), crystal violet, methylene blue, and toluidine blue O (TBO). 
The photobiocidal performance of each dye depended on the relationship between 
the type of dye and microorganism. Gram-negative E. coli and the non-enveloped 
structure of phage MS2 showed more resistance to the photobiocidal reaction than 
Gram-positive S. epidermidis and the enveloped structure of phage phi 6. RB had 
the highest potential to yield reactive oxygen species. However, the 
photobiocidal performance of RB was dependent on the magnitude of the surface 
charge of the microorganisms; for example, anionic RB induced a negative surface 
charge and thus electrical repulsion. On the other hand, the photobiocidal 
performance of TBO was observed to be less affected by the microorganism type. 
The comparative results presented in our study have significant implications for 
selecting photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy (PACT) dyes suitable for 
specific situations and purposes. Furthermore, they contribute to the 
advancement of PACT-related technologies by enhancing their applicability and 
scalability.

Antibody complementarity determining regions (CDRs) participate in antigen 
recognition, but not all participate equally in antigen binding. Here we 
describe a technique for discovering strong, specific binding partners to 
defined motifs within the CDRs of chimeric, engineered antibodies using affinity 
selection and counter-selection of epitopes displayed on bacteriophage MS2-based 
virus-like particles (VLPs). As an example, we show how this technique can be 
used to identify families of VLPs that interact with antibodies displaying the 
CDRs encoded by the germline precursor of a broadly neutralizing monoclonal 
antibody against HIV-1.

For the first time, a complete all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) model of a 
virus, bacteriophage MS2, in its entirety, including a protein outer shell, 
native genomic RNA with necessary divalent ions, and surrounding explicit 
aqueous solution with ions at physiological concentration, was built. The model 
is based on an experimentally measured cryo-EM structure, which was 
substantially augmented by reconstructing missing or low-resolution parts of the 
measured density (where the atomistic structure cannot be fit unambiguously). 
The model was tested by a quarter of a microsecond MD run, and various 
biophysical characteristics are obtained and analyzed. The developed methodology 
of building the model can be used for reconstructing other large biomolecular 
structures when experimental data are fragmented and/or of varying resolution, 
while the model itself can be used for studying the biology of MS2, including 
the dynamics of its interaction with the host bacteria.

Until recently only 11 distinct Sgls (single gene lysis proteins) have been 
experimentally identified. Of these, three have been shown to be specific 
inhibitors of different steps in the pathway that supplies Lipid II to the 
peptidoglycan (PG) biosynthesis machinery: Qβ A2 inhibits MurA, ϕX174 E inhibits 
MraY, and Lys from coliphage M inhibits MurJ. These Sgls have been called 
"protein antibiotics" because the lytic event is a septal catastrophe 
indistinguishable from that caused by cell wall antibiotics. Here we propose to 
designate these as members of type I Sgls, to distinguish them from another Sgl, 
the L protein of the paradigm ssRNA phage MS2. Although none of the other 
distinct Sgls have significant sequence similarity to L, alignments suggested 
the presence of four domains distinguished by hydrophobic and polar character. 
The simplest notion is that these other Sgls have the same autolytic mechanism 
and, based on this, constitute type II. Although the number of experimentally 
confirmed Sgls has not changed, recent environmental metagenomes and 
metatranscriptomes have revealed thousands of new ssRNA phage genomes, each of 
which presumably has at least one Sgl gene. Here we report on methods to 
distinguish type I and type II Sgls. Using phase-contrast microscopy, we show 
that both classes of Sgls cause the formation of blebs prior to lysis, but the 
location of the blebs differs significantly. In addition, we show that L and 
other type II Sgls do not inhibit net synthesis of PG, as measured by 
incorporation of 3[H]-diaminopimelic acid. Finally, we provide support for the 
unexpected finding by Adler and colleagues that the Sgl from Pseudomonas phage 
PP7 is a type I Sgl, as determined by the two methods. This shows that the 
sharing the putative 4-domain structure suggested for L is not a reliable 
discriminator for operational characterization of Sgls. Overall, this study 
establishes new ways to rapidly classify novel Sgls and thus may facilitate the 
identification of new cell envelope targets that will help generate new 
antibiotics.

Virus-like particles (VLPs) derived from bacteriophages have many applications 
in biomedical sciences, especially in the development of candidate vaccines 
against viral and bacterial infections. Bacteriophage VLPs can be manufactured 
cheaply and in large quantities in bacteria compared to eukaryotic expression 
systems. In addition to this, bacteriophage VLPs are excellent platforms for 
vaccine design for the following reason: Humans do not have preexisting 
antibodies against bacteriophage VLPs. Thus, antigens displayed on bacteriophage 
VLP platforms are expected to be highly immunogenic. As such, VLPs derived from 
MS2, PP7, Qβ, AP205, P22 bacteriophages, etc. have been used to develop 
candidate vaccines against human infectious and noninfectious agents. This 
mini-review summarizes data from some of the candidate bacteriophage-based VLP 
peptide vaccines that have been developed. The review also highlights some 
strategies used to develop the candidate bacteriophage-based VLP peptide 
vaccines.

Anaerobic and microalgae-based technologies for municipal wastewater treatment 
have emerged as sustainable alternatives to activated sludge systems. However, 
viruses are a major sanitary concern for reuse applications of liquid and solid 
byproducts from these technologies. To assess their capacity to reduce viruses 
during secondary wastewater treatment, enveloped Phi6 and nonenveloped MS2 
bacteriophages, typically used as surrogates of several types of wastewater 
viruses, were spiked into batch bioreactors treating synthetic municipal 
wastewater (SMWW). The decay of Phi6 and MS2 in anaerobic and microalgae-based 
reactors was compared with the decay in activated sludge batch reactors for 96 h 
(Phi6) and 144 h (MS2). In each reactor, bacteriophages in the soluble and 
solids fractions were titered, allowing the assessment of virus partitioning to 
biomass over time. Moreover, the influence of abiotic conditions such as 
agitation, oxygen absence and light excess in activated sludge, anaerobic and 
microalgae reactors, respectively, was assessed using dedicated SMWW control 
reactors. All technologies showed Phi6 and MS2 reductions. Phi6 was reduced in 
at least 4.7 to 6.5 log10 units, with 0 h concentrations ranging from 5.0 to 6.5 
log10 PFU mL-1. Similarly, reductions achieved for MS2 were of at least 3.9 to 
7.2 log10 units, from starting concentrations of 8.0 to 8.6 log10 PFU mL-1. 
Log-logistic models adjusted to bacteriophages' decay indicated T90 values in 
activated sludge and microalgae reactors of 2.2 and 7.9 h for Phi6 and of 1.0 
and 11.5 h for MS2, respectively, all within typical hydraulic retention times 
(HRT) of full-scale operation. In the case of the microalgae technology, T99 
values for Phi6 and MS2 of 12.7 h and 13.6 h were also lower than typical 
operating HRTs (2-10 d), while activated sludge and anaerobic treatment achieved 
less than 99 % of Phi6 and 50 % of MS2 inactivation within 12 h of typical HRT, 
respectively. Thus, the microalgae-based treatment exhibited a higher potential 
to reduce the disinfection requirements of treated wastewater.

In vitro characterization of the phage lysis protein MS2-L.

Background: The peptide MS2-L represents toxins of the ssRNA Leviviridae phage 
family and consists of a predicted N-terminal soluble domain followed by a 
transmembrane domain. MS2-L mediates bacterial cell lysis through the formation 
of large lesions in the cell envelope, but further details of this mechanism as 
a prerequisite for applied bioengineering studies are lacking. The chaperone 
DnaJ is proposed to modulate MS2-L activity, whereas other cellular targets of 
MS2-L are unknown. Methods: Here, we provide a combined in vitro and in vivo 
overexpression approach to reveal molecular insights into MS2-L action and its 
interaction with DnaJ. Full-length MS2-L and truncated derivatives were 
synthesized cell-free and co-translationally inserted into nanodiscs or 
solubilized in detergent micelles. By native liquid bead ion desorption mass 
spectrometry, we demonstrate that MS2-L assembles into high oligomeric states 
after membrane insertion. Results: Oligomerization is directed by the 
transmembrane domain and is impaired in detergent environments. Studies with 
truncated MS2-L derivatives provide evidence that the soluble domain acts as a 
modulator of oligomer formation. DnaJ strongly interacts with MS2-L in membranes 
as well as in detergent environments. However, this interaction affects neither 
the MS2-L membrane insertion efficiency nor its oligomerization in nanodisc 
membranes. In accordance with the in vitro data, the assembly of MS2-L 
derivatives into large membrane located clusters was monitored by overexpression 
of corresponding fusions with fluorescent monitors in E. coli cells. Analysis by 
cryo-electron microscopy indicates that lesion formation is initiated in the 
outer membrane, followed by disruption of the peptidoglycan layer and 
disintegration of the inner membrane. Conclusion: MS2-L forms oligomeric 
complexes similar to the related phage toxin ΦX174-E. The oligomeric interface 
of both peptides is located within their transmembrane domains. We propose a 
potential function of the higher-order assembly of small phage toxins in 
membrane disintegration and cell lysis.

in Animal Cells.

RNA expression analyses can be used to obtain various information from inside 
cells, such as physical conditions, the chemical environment, and endogenous 
signals. For detecting RNA, the system regulating intracellular gene expression 
has the potential for monitoring RNA expression levels in real time within 
living cells. Synthetic biology provides powerful tools for detecting and 
analyzing RNA inside cells. Here, we devised an RNA aptamer-mediated gene 
activation system, RAMGA, to induce RNA-triggered gene expression activation by 
employing an inducible complex formation strategy grounded in synthetic biology. 
This methodology connects DNA-binding domains and transactivators through target 
RNA using RNA-binding domains, including phage coat proteins. MS2 bacteriophage 
coat protein fused with a transcriptional activator and PP7 bacteriophage coat 
protein fused with the tetracycline repressor (tetR) can be bridged by target 
RNA encoding MS2 and PP7 stem-loops, resulting in transcriptional activation. We 
generated recombinant CHO cells containing an inducible GFP expression module 
governed by a minimal promoter with a tetR-responsive element. Cells carrying 
the trigger RNA exhibited robust reporter gene expression, whereas cells lacking 
it exhibited no expression. GFP expression was upregulated over 200-fold 
compared with that in cells without a target RNA expression vector. Moreover, 
this system can detect the expression of mRNA tagged with aptamer tags and 
modulate reporter gene expression based on the target mRNA level without 
affecting the expression of the original mRNA-encoding gene. The RNA-triggered 
gene expression systems developed in this study have potential as a new platform 
for establishing gene circuits, evaluating endogenous gene expression, and 
developing novel RNA detectors.

An alarming rise in antimicrobial resistance worldwide has spurred efforts into 
the search for alternatives to antibiotic treatments. The use of bacteriophages, 
bacterial viruses harmless to humans, represents a promising approach with 
potential to treat bacterial infections (phage therapy). Recent advances in 
microscopy-based single-cell techniques have allowed researchers to develop new 
quantitative methodologies for assessing the interactions between bacteria and 
phages, especially the ability of phages to eradicate bacterial pathogen 
populations and to modulate growth of both commensal and pathogen populations. 
Here we combine droplet microfluidics with fluorescence time-lapse microscopy to 
characterize the growth and lysis dynamics of the bacterium Escherichia coli 
confined in droplets when challenged with phage. We investigated phages that 
promote lysis of infected E. coli cells, specifically, a phage species with DNA 
genome, T7 (Escherichia virus T7) and two phage species with RNA genomes, MS2 
(Emesvirus zinderi) and Qβ (Qubevirus durum). Our microfluidic trapping device 
generated and immobilized picoliter-sized droplets, enabling stable imaging of 
bacterial growth and lysis in a temperature-controlled setup. Temporal 
information on bacterial population size was recorded for up to 25 h, allowing 
us to determine growth rates of bacterial populations and helping us uncover the 
extent and speed of phage infection. In the long-term, the development of novel 
microfluidic single-cell and population-level approaches will expedite research 
towards fundamental understanding of the genetic and molecular basis of rapid 
phage-induced lysis and eco-evolutionary aspects of bacteria-phage dynamics, and 
ultimately help identify key factors influencing the success of phage therapy.

Human enteric viruses are important etiological agents of waterborne diseases. 
Environmental waters are usually contaminated with low virus concentration 
requiring large concentration factors for effective detection by (RT)-qPCR. 
Low-pressure reverse osmosis is often used to remove water contaminants, but 
very few studies focused on the effective virus removal of reverse osmosis 
treatment with feed concentrations as close as possible to environmental 
concentrations and principally relied on theoretical virus removal. The very low 
viral concentrations usually reported in the permeates (i.e. at least 5 log of 
removal rate) mean that very large volumes of water need to be analysed to have 
sufficient sensitivity and assess the process efficiency. This study evaluates 
two methods for the concentration of adenoviruses, enteroviruses and MS2 
bacteriophages at different viral concentrations in large (< 200 L) and very 
large (> 200 L) volumes. The first method is composed of two ultrafiltration 
membranes with low-molecular weight cut-offs while the second method primarily 
relies on adsorption and elution phases using electropositive-charged filters. 
The recovery rates were assessed for both methods. For the ultrafiltration-based 
protocol, recovery rates were similar for each virus studied: 80% on average at 
high virus concentrations (106-107 viruses L-1) and 50% at low virus 
concentrations (103-104 viruses L-1). For the electropositive-charged 
filter-based method, the average recoveries obtained were about 36% for ADV 41, 
57% for CV-B5 and 1.6% for MS2. The ultrafiltration-based method was then used 
to evaluate the performance of a low-pressure reverse osmosis lab-scale pilot 
plant. The retentions by reverse osmosis were similar for all studied viruses 
and the validated recovery rates applied to the system confirmed the reliability 
of the concentration method. This method was effective in concentrating all 
three viruses over a wide range of viral concentrations. Moreover, the second 
concentration method using electropositive-charged filters was studied, allowing 
the filtration of larger volumes of permeate from a semi-industrial low-pressure 
reverse osmosis pilot plant. This reference method was used because of the 
inability of the UF method to filter volumes on the order of one cubic metre.

COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus named SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is a 
single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus. Reverse transcription quantitative PCR 
(RT-qPCR) assays are the gold standard molecular test for detection of RNA 
viruses. The aim of this study was to construct an RNA-positive control based on 
MS2 phage-like particles (MS2 VLPs) to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA. pCDFDuet-1 was 
used as a one-plasmid double-expression system to construct MS2 VLPs containing 
ssRNA of SARS-CoV-2. The sequence encoding one copy of maturase, His-tag and 
coat protein dimer was cloned and inserted into MCS1 of the plasmid; the 
fragment encoding protein N and ORF1ab from SARS-CoV-2 was cloned and inserted 
into MCS2. The prepared plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL2 
(DE3), and expression of the construct was induced by 1 mM 
isopropyl-L-thio-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) at 30°C for 12 hours. MS2 VLPs were 
purified and collected with Ni-NTA affinity chromatography columns. The size and 
shape of the MS2 VLPs were verified by transmission electron microscopy, and the 
stability of MS2 VLP packaged RNA was evaluated by treatment with RNase A. 
Effects of storage temperature and buffer on MS2 VLP stability were also 
investigated. The results showed that SARS-CoV-2 MS2 VLPs could be successfully 
produced by this one-plasmid double-expression system. MS2 VLPs showed high 
stability and may be used as a positive control in molecular diagnosis of 
COVID-19.

Electrochlorination has gained research interest for its potential application 
as decentralized water treatment. A number of studies have displayed promising 
efficiency for water disinfection. However, a comprehensive comparison of in 
situ electrodisinfection to existing disinfection techniques, particularly under 
realistic water composition and flow rates, still needs additional research 
efforts. The aim of this study is to evaluate in situ electrochlorination while 
comparing the treatment with conventional chemical chlorination for 
point-of-entry decentralized disinfection at the household level. An 
electrochemical flow cell reactor was operated in a single pass mode considering 
water flow and water consumption for a household of four family members. 
Disinfection efficiency assessment of both electrochemical and chemical 
chlorination was conducted using bacterial and viral surrogates, E. coli and MS2 
bacteriophage. Furthermore, a techno-economic analysis was conducted, using the 
levelized cost of water, to compare two electrochemical chlorination scenarios 
(i.e., electrical grid energy use, and solar panel powered system) and 
benchmarked against the baseline treatment of chemical chlorination. The 
findings revealed increased inactivation efficiency of in situ 
electrochlorination over conventional chlorination (p-value < 0.05). The 
synergetic impact of radicals and chlorine, and/or contribution of high chlorine 
concentration at acidic pH near anode surface were identified as key factors 
that could enhance disinfection performance of in situ electrochlorination. The 
techno-economic analysis demonstrated that electrochemical treatment, when 
operated using renewable energy sources, is not only a more environmentally 
sustainable approach, but also emerges as a more economically feasible solution 
for decentralized water treatment application. The results highlight that in 
situ electrochlorination is a more advanced alternative to decentralized water 
chlorination. However, further fundamental research on products and by-products 
formation under various water matrices is required.

INTRODUCTION: In the light of the problem of antibiotic resistance, the use of 
combined alternative therapies in combatting bacteria-related disorders has 
gained popularity. Bacteriophages are one element implemented in new combination 
therapy. Stevia rebaudiana is known to have antimicrobial activity and regarded 
as potentially having a synergistic effect with bacteriophages. Therefore, 
possible interactions of lytic bacteriophages (MS2, T4 and Phi6) with acetone 
and methanol S. rebaudiana extracts (SRa and SRm) in the bacterial environment 
were examined.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The interactions were tested using a microdilution method, 
phage-extract co-incubation assay, static interaction (synography) and dynamic 
growth profile experiments in a bioreactor.
RESULTS: The interactions of the tested factors in a static environment differed 
from those in a dynamic environment. Dynamic conditions altered the effect of 
the extracts in a concentration-dependent manner. How different the effect of 
the SRa extract was to that of the SRm extract on bacterial growth in a dynamic 
environment depended on the species of the phage and bacterial host. The 
greatest differences were observed for E. coli strains and their phages, whereas 
Pseudomonas syringae and the Phi6 phage reacted very similarly to both extracts. 
Differences also emerged for the same extract in different E. coli strains and 
their phages.
CONCLUSION: Every extract type should be tested on a case-by-case basis and 
experiment outcomes should not be generalised before gathering data. Moreover, 
many varied experiments should be performed, especially when examining such 
multifactorial mixtures. The tested mixtures could potentially be used in 
multidrug-resistant bacterial infection treatments.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D), a global health concern, is closely associated with the 
gut microbiota. Restoration of a balanced microbiota and intestinal homeostasis 
benefit therapy of T2D. Some special phages may selectively alter the gut 
microbiota without causing dysbiosis, such as MS2 and P22. However, scarcely 
systematic analysis of cascading effects triggered by MS2 and P22 phages on the 
microbiota, as well as interactions between specific gut bacteria and systemic 
metabolism, seriously inhibit the development of positive interventions of 
phages. Based on multi-omic analysis, we analyzed the intrinsic correlations 
among specific microbiota, their bioactive metabolites, and key indicators of 
T2D. We found that gavage of the MS2-P22 phage cocktail could significantly 
alter the gut microbiome to attenuate dysbiosis of diabetic C57BL/6 mice caused 
by high-fat diets (HFDs) and streptozotocin (STZ), by affecting microbial 
compositions as well as their metabolic pathways and metabolites, especially 
increasing amounts of short-chain fatty acid-producing (SCFA-producing) bacteria 
(e.g., Blautia and Romboutsia) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). 
Correspondingly, a noteworthy reduction in the number of several opportunistic 
pathogens occurred, e.g., Candidatus Saccharimonas, Aerococcus, Oscillibacter, 
Desulfovibrio, and Clostridium sensu stricto 1. Synchronously, the levels of 
proinflammatory cytokines and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were reduced to recover 
gut barrier function in T2D mice. These findings might benefit the development 
of a new dietary intervention for T2D based on phage cocktails. KEY POINTS: • 
Intestinal barrier integrity of T2D mice is improved by a phage cocktail • 
Negative relationship between Muribaculaceae and Corynebacterium reshaped gut 
microbiota • Acetate, propionate, and butyrate decreased the level of 
proinflammatory factors.

Waterborne pathogenic viruses present unrelenting challenges to the global 
health and wastewater treatment industry. Phytoremediation offers promising 
solutions for wastewater treatment through plant-based technologies. This study 
investigated antiviral mechanisms in-vivo using bacteriophages MS2 and T4 as 
surrogates for effective herbs screened in-vitro from three embryophytes (Ocimum 
basilicum, Mentha sp., Plectranthus amboinicus), two macrophytes (Eichhornia 
crassipes, Pistia stratiotes) and a perennial grass (Cyperus rotundas). 
In-silico virtual screening predicted antiviral phytochemicals for further 
antiviral potency assessment. Results suggested in-vitro antiviral activities of 
embryophytes and macrophytes were higher (43-62%) than grass (21-26%). O. 
basilicum (OB, 57-62%) and P. stratiotes (PS, 59-60%) exhibited the highest 
antiviral activities. In-vivo tests showed notable virus reduction (>60%) in 
culture solution, attributed to rhizofiltration (66-74%) and 
phytoinactivation/phytodegradation (63-84%). In-silico analysis identified rutin 
as a primary antiviral phytochemical for MS2 (-9.7 kcal/mol) and T4 
(-10.9 kcal/mol), correlating with dose-response inactivation (∼58-62%). In-vivo 
tests suggested additional phytocompounds may contribute to viral inactivation, 
presenting new opportunities for herb-based wastewater treatment solutions. 
Consequently, this study not only demonstrates the antiviral capabilities of OB 
and PS but also introduces an innovative approach for addressing viral 
contaminants in water.

Microplastics have emerged as a concerning contaminant in drinking water 
sources, potentially interacting with pathogenic microorganisms and affecting 
the disinfection processes. In this study, MS2 was selected as an alternative 
for the human enteric virus. The influence of microplastics polyvinylchloride 
(MPs-PVC) on ultraviolet light emitting diode (UV-LED) inactivation of MS2 was 
investigated under various water chemistry conditions, such as MPs-PVC 
concentration, pH, salinity, and humic acid concentration. The results revealed 
that higher concentrations of MPs-PVC led to the reduced inactivation of MS2 by 
decreased UV transmittance, hindering the disinfection process. Additionally, 
the inactivation efficiency of MS2 in the presence of MPs-PVC was influenced by 
pH, and acidic solution (pH at 4, 5, and 6) exhibited higher efficiency compared 
to alkaline solution (pH at 8 and 9) and neutral solution (pH at 7). The low Na+ 
concentrations (0-50 mM) had a noticeable effect on MS2 inaction efficiency in 
the presence of MPs-PVC, while the addition of Ca2+ posed an insignificant 
effect due to the preferential interaction with MPs-PVC. Furthermore, the 
inactivation rate of MS2 initially increased and then decreased with increasing 
the concentration of humic acid, which was significantly different without 
MPs-PVC. These findings shed light on the complex interactions between MPs-PVC 
and MS2 in the UV-LED disinfection process under various water-quality 
parameters, contributing to drinking water safety and treatment.

This study assessed the efficacy of ozone (bubble diffusion in water; 6.25 ppm) 
and photodynamic inactivation (PDT) using curcumin (75 μM) as photosensitizer 
(LED emission 430-470 nm; 33.6 mW/cm2 irradiance; 16.1, 20.2, and 24.2 J/cm2 
light dose) against the Norovirus surrogate bacteriophage MS2 in Brazilian 
berries (black mulberry and pitanga) and surfaces (glass and stainless steel). 
Contaminated berries and surfaces were immersed in ozonized water or exposed to 
PDT-curcumin for different time intervals. Transmission electron microscopy was 
used to assess the effects of the treatments on MS2 viral particles. The MS2 
inactivation by ozone and PDT-curcumin varied with the fruit and the surface 
tested. Ozone reduced the MS2 titer up to 3.6 log PFU/g in black mulberry and 
4.1 log PFU/g in pitanga. On surfaces, the MS2 reduction by ozone reached 3.6 
and 4.8 log PFU/cm2 on glass and stainless steel, respectively. PDT-curcumin 
reduced the MS2 3.2 and 4.8 log PFU/g in black mulberry and pitanga and 2.7 and 
3.3 log PFU/cm2 on glass and stainless steel, respectively. MS2 particles were 
disintegrated by exposure of MS2 to ozone and PDT-curcumin on pitanga. Results 
can contribute to establishing effective practices for controlling NoV in fruits 
and surfaces, estimated based on MS2 bacteriophage behavior.

Intracellular bacterial infections bring a considerable risk to human life and 
health due to their capability to elude immune defenses and exhibit significant 
drug resistance. As a result, confronting and managing these infections present 
substantial challenges. In this study, we developed a multifunctional living 
phage nanoconjugate by integrating aggregation-induced emission luminogen 
(AIEgen) photosensitizers and nucleic acids onto a bacteriophage framework 
(forming MS2-DNA-AIEgen bioconjugates). These nanoconjugates can rapidly 
penetrate mammalian cells and specifically identify intracellular bacteria while 
concurrently producing a detectable fluorescent signal. By harnessing the 
photodynamic property of AIEgen photosensitizer and the bacteriophage's inherent 
targeting and lysis capability, the intracellular bacteria can be effectively 
eliminated and the activity of the infected cells can be restored. Moreover, our 
engineered phage nanoconjugates were able to expedite the healing process in 
bacterially infected wounds observed in diabetic mice models while 
simultaneously enhancing immune activity within infected cells and in vivo, 
without displaying noticeable toxicity. We envision that these multifunctional 
phage nanoconjugates, which utilize AIEgen photosensitizers and spherical 
nucleic acids, may present a groundbreaking strategy for combating intracellular 
bacteria and offer powerful avenues for theranostic applications in 
intracellular bacterial infection-associated diseases.

of Anoxybacillus flavithermus.

Reverse transcriptases (RTs) are a family of enzymes that synthesize DNA using 
an RNA template and are involved in retrovirus propagation and telomere 
lengthening. In vitro, RTs are widely applied in various methods, including 
RNA-seq, RT-PCR, and RT-LAMP. Thermostable RTs from bacterial group II introns 
are promising tools for biotechnology due to their higher thermostability, 
fidelity, and processivity compared to commonly used M-MuLV RT and its mutants. 
However, the diversity of group II intron-encoded RTs is still understudied. In 
this work, we biochemically characterized a novel RT from a thermophilic 
bacterium, Anoxybacillus flavithermus, which was isolated from a hot spring in 
New Zealand and has an optimal growth temperature of around 60 °C. The cloned 
RT, named Afl RT, retained approximately 40% of the specific activity after a 45 
min incubation at 50 °C. The optimal pH was 8.5, the optimal temperature was 
between 45 and 50 °C, and Mn2+ ions were found to be an optimal cofactor. The 
processivity analysis with MS2 phage gRNA (3569 b) demonstrated that Afl RT 
elongated fully up to 36% of the template molecules. In reverse transcription 
and RT-qLAMP, the enzyme allowed up to 10 copies of MS2 phage genomic RNA to be 
detected per reaction. Thus, Afl RT holds great potential for a variety of 
practical applications that require the use of thermostable and processive RTs.

Update of
    ArXiv. 2024 Jan 16;:

Self-assembly is a vital part of the life cycle of certain icosahedral RNA 
viruses. Furthermore, the assembly process can be harnessed to make icosahedral 
virus-like particles (VLPs) from coat protein and RNA in vitro. Although much 
previous work has explored the effects of RNA-protein interactions on the 
assembly products, relatively little research has explored the effects of 
coat-protein concentration. We mix coat protein and RNA from bacteriophage MS2, 
and we use a combination of gel electrophoresis, dynamic light scattering, and 
transmission electron microscopy to investigate the assembly products. We show 
that with increasing coat-protein concentration, the products transition from 
well-formed MS2 VLPs to "monster" particles consisting of multiple partial 
capsids to RNA-protein condensates consisting of large networks of RNA and 
partially assembled capsids. We argue that the transition from well-formed to 
monster particles arises because the assembly follows a nucleation-and-growth 
pathway in which the nucleation rate depends sensitively on the coat-protein 
concentration, such that at high protein concentrations, multiple nuclei can 
form on each RNA strand. To understand the formation of the condensates, which 
occurs at even higher coat-protein concentrations, we use Monte Carlo 
simulations with coarse-grained models of capsomers and RNA. These simulations 
suggest that the formation of condensates occurs by the adsorption of protein to 
the RNA followed by the assembly of capsids. Multiple RNA molecules can become 
trapped when a capsid grows from capsomers attached to two different RNA 
molecules or when excess protein bridges together growing capsids on different 
RNA molecules. Our results provide insight into an important biophysical process 
and could inform design rules for making VLPs for various applications.

The aim of this study was to compare the biological properties, such as 
antiviral, antibacterial, and antioxidant, of recently described pentaploid 
species Rubus oklejewiczii with tetraploid taxa growing in similar habitats 
including R. plicatus, R. gracilis, and R. wimmerianus. The antiviral potential 
was analyzed against bacteriophages with different genetic material: phi6 (a 
surrogate for the SARS-CoV-2 virus), T7, phiX174, and MS2. Antibacterial 
properties of fruit and leaf extracts were determined against Staphylococcus 
aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella enterica. The total 
phenolic content, as well as anthocyanins, ascorbic acid, pH, and antioxidant 
properties (FRAP and DPPH) were determined. R. oklejewiczii leaf extract was 
characterized by the weakest antibacterial and antiviral properties, which was 
closely correlated with the lowest content of polyphenolic compounds and 
antioxidant properties. The strongest biological properties were observed for R. 
wimmerianus leaves. Fruit extracts were characterized by lower phenolic content 
and antioxidant activities than leaves, with the lowest values observed for R. 
oklejewiczii extract. The antibacterial properties of fruit extracts were 
strongest for R. gracilis. The strongest antiviral potential was observed for R. 
oklejewiczii and R. wimmerianus fruit extracts against the bacteriophage phi6, 
which correlated with the lowest pH and the highest ascorbic acid content. The 
positive effect of the higher ploidy of R. oklejewiczii for most of the analyzed 
biological properties was not observed except for the antiviral potential of 
fruit extract. Due to its large and tasty fruits, this species seems to be very 
promising for cultivation and attractive for consumers, even though most of its 
biological properties were not any better compared to other examined tetraploid 
species.

The outbreak of emerging infectious diseases gave rise to the demand for 
reliable point-of-care testing methods to diagnose and manage those diseases in 
early onset. However, the current on-site testing methods including lateral flow 
immunoassay (LFIA) suffer from the inaccurate diagnostic result due to the low 
sensitivity. Herein, we present the surface-enhanced Raman scattering-based 
lateral flow immunoassay (SERS-LFIA) by introducing phage-templated hierarchical 
plasmonic assembly (PHPA) nanoprobes to diagnose a contagious disease. The PHPA 
was fabricated using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) assembled on bacteriophage MS2, 
where inter-particle gap sizes can be adjusted by pH-induced morphological 
alteration of MS2 coat proteins to provide the maximum SERS amplification 
efficiency via plasmon coupling. The plasmonic probes based on the PHPA produce 
strong and reproducible SERS signal that leads to sensitive and reliable 
diagnostic results in SERS-LFIA. The developed SERS-LFIA targeting severe acute 
respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies for a proof of 
concept had <100 pg/mL detection limits with high specificity in serum, proving 
it as an effective diagnostic device for the infectious diseases. Clinical 
validation using human serum samples further confirmed that the PHPA-based 
SERS-LFIA can distinguish the patients with COVID-19 from healthy controls with 
significant accuracy. These outcomes prove that the developed SERS-LFIA 
biosensor can be an alternative point-of-care testing (POCT) method against the 
emerging infectious diseases, in combination with the commercially available 
portable Raman devices.

In this study, two types of woodchip-amended biosand filters (Filter A sand: 
woodchip = 33%: 67% versus Filter B sand: woodchip = 50%: 50%, by volume) were 
constructed, and their abilities to remove MS2 bacteriophage and nitrate were 
investigated. The results indicated that Filter A and Filter B could reduce 
nitrate up to 40 and 36%, respectively, indicating that the nitrate reduction 
increased with the increase in woodchip proportion. The study underscores a 
positive correlation between nitrate reduction and proportional increase in 
woodchip content, implying the potential for fine-tuning nitrate removal by 
varying sand-woodchip compositions. W-BSFs could remove MS2 bacteriophage to 
1.91-log10 (98.8%) by Filter A and 1.88-log10 (98.7%) by Filter B over 39 weeks. 
The difference in sand-woodchip proportion did not significantly impact the MS2 
reduction, demonstrating that a single W-BSF can maintain its virus removal 
performance fairly well over a long-term period. These results indicated that 
the nitrate reduction could be adjusted by varying sand-woodchip contents 
without impacting virus removal performance. Microbial community analysis 
indicated that the nitrate removal by the W-BSFs could be attributed to the 
denitrifying bacteria, such as the family Streptomycetaceae, the genera 
Pseudomonas, and Bacillus, and relative abundances of the phylum Nitrospirae.

inactivation kinetics of viable human norovirus compared to the surrogate MS2 
bacteriophage, which was cultured using a plaque assay. Norovirus decay rates 
were 0.22 min-1, 0.68 min-1, and 1.11 min-1 for 50°C, 60°C, and 70°C, 
respectively, and MS2 bacteriophage decay rates were 0.0065 min-1, 0.045 min-1, 
and 0.16 min-1 for 50°C, 60°C, and 70°C, respectively. Norovirus had 
significantly higher decay rates than MS2 bacteriophage at all tested 
temperatures (P = .002-.007). No decrease of RNA titers as measured by reverse 
transcription-PCR for both human norovirus and MS2 bacteriophage over time was 
observed, indicating molecular methods do not accurately depict viable human 
norovirus after heat inactivation and treatment efficiency is underestimated.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our data demonstrate that MS2 bacteriophage is a 
conservative surrogate to measure heat inactivation and potentially 
overestimates the infectious risk of norovirus. Furthermore, this study 
corroborates that measuring viral RNA titers, as evaluated by PCR methods, does 
not correlate with the persistence of viable norovirus under heat inactivation.

Water reuse is a growing global reality. In regulating water reuse, viruses have 
come to the fore as key pathogens due to high shedding rates, low infectious 
doses, and resilience to traditional wastewater treatments. To demonstrate the 
high log reductions required by emerging water reuse regulations, cost and 
practicality necessitate surrogates for viruses for use as challenge organisms 
in unit process evaluation and monitoring. Bacteriophage surrogates that are 
mitigated to the same or lesser extent than viruses of concern are routinely 
used for individual unit process testing. However, the behavior of these 
surrogates over a multi-barrier treatment train typical of water reuse has not 
been well-established. Toward this aim, we performed a meta-analysis of log 
reductions of common bacteriophage surrogates for five treatment processes 
typical of water reuse treatment trains: advanced oxidation processes, 
chlorination, membrane filtration, ozonation, and ultraviolet (UV) disinfection. 
Robust linear regression was applied to identify a range of doses consistent 
with a given log reduction of bacteriophages and viruses of concern for each 
treatment process. The results were used to determine relative conservatism of 
surrogates. We found that no one bacteriophage was a representative or 
conservative surrogate for viruses of concern across all multi-barrier 
treatments (encompassing multiple mechanisms of virus mitigation). Rather, a 
suite of bacteriophage surrogates provides both a representative range of 
inactivation and information about the effectiveness of individual processes 
within a treatment train. Based on the abundance of available data and diversity 
of virus treatability using these five key water reuse treatment processes, 
bacteriophages MS2, phiX174, and Qbeta were recommended as a core suite of 
surrogates for virus challenge testing.

Groundwater flow and contaminant migration tracing is a vital method of 
identifying and characterising pollutant source-pathway-receptor linkages in 
karst aquifers. Bacteriophages are an attractive alternative tracer to 
non-reactive fluorescent dye tracers, as high titres (>1012 pfu mL-1) can be 
safely released into the aquifer, offering improved tracer detectability. 
However, the interpretation of bacteriophage tracer breakthrough curves is 
complicated as their fate and transport are impacted by aquifer physicochemical 
conditions. A comparative tracer migration experiment was conducted in a 
peri-urban catchment in southeast England to characterise the behaviour of MS2 
bacteriophage relative to sodium fluorescein dye in a karstic chalk aquifer. 
Tracers were released into a stream sink and detected at two abstraction 
boreholes located 3 km and 10 km away. At both sites, the loss of MS2 phage 
greatly exceeded that of the solute tracer. In contrast, the qualitative shape 
of the dye and phage breakthrough curves were visually very similar, suggesting 
that the bacteriophage arriving at each site was governed by comparable 
transport parameters to the non-reactive dye tracer. The colloid filtration 
theory was applied to explain the apparent contradiction of comparable tracer 
breakthrough patterns despite massive phage losses in the subsurface. 
One-dimensional transport models were also fitted to each breakthrough curve to 
facilitate a quantitative comparison of the transport parameter values. The 
model results suggest that the bacteriophage migrates through the conduit system 
slightly faster than the fluorescent dye, but that the former is significantly 
less dispersed. These results suggest that whilst the bacteriophage tracer 
cannot be used to predict receptor concentrations from transport via karstic 
flow paths, it can provide estimates for groundwater flow and solute contaminant 
transit times. This study also provides insight into the attenuation and 
transport of pathogenic viruses in karstic chalk aquifers.

Single-strand RNA (ssRNA) and single-strand DNA phages elicit host lysis using a 
single gene, in each case designated as sgl. Of the 11 identified Sgls, three 
have been shown to be specific inhibitors of different steps in the pathway that 
supplies lipid II to the peptidoglycan (PG) biosynthesis machinery. These Sgls 
have been called "protein antibiotics" because the lytic event is a septal 
catastrophe indistinguishable from that caused by cell wall antibiotics. Here, 
we designate these as type I Sgls. In this formalism, the other eight Sgls are 
assigned to type II, the best-studied of which is protein L of the paradigm 
F-specific ssRNA phage MS2. Comparisons have suggested that type II Sgls have 
four sequence elements distinguished by hydrophobic and polar character. 
Environmental metatranscriptomics has revealed thousands of new ssRNA phage 
genomes, each of which presumably has an Sgl. Here, we describe methods to 
distinguish type I and type II Sgls. Using phase contrast microscopy, we show 
that both classes of Sgls cause the formation of blebs prior to lysis, but the 
location of the blebs differs significantly. In addition, we show that L and 
other type II Sgls do not inhibit the net synthesis of PG, as measured by 
radio-labeling of PG. Finally, we provide direct evidence that the Sgl from 
Pseudomonas phage PP7 is a type I Sgl, in support of a recent report based on a 
genetic selection. This shows that the putative four-element sequence structure 
suggested for L is not a reliable discriminator for the operational 
characterization of Sgls.
IMPORTANCE: The ssRNA phage world has recently undergone a metagenomic expansion 
upward of a thousandfold. Each genome likely carries at least one single-gene 
lysis (sgl) cistron encoding a protein that single-handedly induces host 
autolysis. Here, we initiate an approach to segregate the Sgls into operational 
types based on physiological analysis, as a first step toward the alluring goal 
of finding many new ways to induce bacterial death and the attendant 
expectations for new antibiotic development.
