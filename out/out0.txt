Title: A transient in planta editing assay identifies specific binding of the splicing regulator PTB as a prerequisite for cassette exon inclusion.
Abstract: The dynamic interaction of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) with their target RNAs contributes to the diversity of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes that are involved in a myriad of biological processes. Identifying the RNP components at high resolution and defining their interactions are key to understanding their regulation and function. Expressing fusions between an RBP of interest and an RNA editing enzyme can result in nucleobase changes in target RNAs, representing a recent addition to experimental approaches for profiling RBP/RNA interactions. Here, we have used the MS2 protein/RNA interaction to test four RNA editing proteins for their suitability to detect target RNAs of RBPs in planta. We have established a transient test system for fast and simple quantification of editing events and identified the hyperactive version of the catalytic domain of an adenosine deaminase (hADARcd) as the most suitable editing enzyme. Examining fusions between homologs of polypyrimidine tract binding proteins (PTBs) from Arabidopsis thaliana and hADARcd allowed determining target RNAs with high sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, almost complete editing of a splicing intermediate provided insight into the order of splicing reactions and PTB dependency of this particular splicing event. Addition of sequences for nuclear localisation of the fusion protein increased the editing efficiency, highlighting this approach's potential to identify RBP targets in a compartment-specific manner. Our studies have established the editing-based analysis of interactions between RBPs and their RNA targets in a fast and straightforward assay, offering a new system to study the intricate composition and functions of plant RNPs in vivo.

Title: Engineered Protease-Responsive RNA-Binding Proteins (RBPs) to Expand the Toolbox of Synthetic Circuits in Mammalian Cells.
Abstract: Genetically encoded sensor-actuator circuits aim at reprogramming cellular functions and are inspired by intracellular networks: from the input signal (sensor) to the desired output response (actuator). In the last years, circuits with posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression have aroused great interest for their potential in the biomedical space. Posttranscriptional modulation can be achieved with ribozymes, riboswitches (simple regulatory elements based on RNA secondary structures), noncoding RNAs, and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). RBPs are proteins that recognize specific motifs on the mRNA target inducing mRNA decay or translation inhibition. The use of RBPs deriving from different species in mammalian cells has allowed to create sophisticated and multilayered regulatory networks, addressing the previous limitation of regulatory orthogonal parts that can be assembled in synthetic devices. In this chapter, we describe the engineering and tests of protease-responsive RNA-binding proteins (L7Ae and MS2-cNOT7) to expand the toolbox of synthetic circuits in mammalian cells.

Title: Localizing Isomerized Residue Sites in Peptides with Tandem Mass Spectrometry.
Abstract: Isomerized amino acid residues have been identified in many peptides extracted from tissues or excretions of humans and animals. These isomerized residues can play key roles by affecting biological activity or by exerting an influence on the process of aging. Isomerization occurs spontaneously and does not result in a mass shift. Thus, identifying and localizing isomerized residues in biological samples is challenging. Herein, we introduce a fast and efficient method using tandem mass spectrometry (MS) to locate isomerized residues in peptides. Although MS<sup>2</sup> spectra are useful for identifying peptides that contain an isomerized residue, they cannot reliably localize isomerization sites. We show that this limitation can be overcome by utilizing MS<sup>3</sup> experiments to further evaluate each fragment ion from the MS<sup>2</sup> stage. Comparison at the MS<sup>3</sup> level, utilizing statistical analyses, reveals which MS<sup>2</sup> fragments differ between samples and, therefore, must contain the isomerized sites. The approach is similar to previous work relying on ion mobility to discriminate MS<sup>2</sup> product ions by collision cross-section. The MS<sup>3</sup> approach can be implemented using either ion-trap or beam-type collisional activation and is compatible with the quantification of isomer mixtures when coupled to a calibration curve. The method can also be implemented in combination with liquid chromatography in a targeted approach. Enabling the identification and localization of isomerized residues in peptides with an MS-only methodology will expand accessibility to this important information.

Title: Activation of cardiac parasympathetic and sympathetic activity occur at different skin temperatures during face cooling.
Abstract: Sufficiently cold-water temperatures (<7<sup>o</sup>C) are needed to elicit the sympathetic response to the cold pressor test using the hand. However, it is not known if stimulating the trigeminal nerve via face cooling, which increases both sympathetic and cardiac parasympathetic activity, also has a threshold temperature. We tested the hypothesis that peak autonomic activation during a progressive face cooling challenge would be achieved when the stimulus temperature is £ 7<sup>o</sup>C. Twelve healthy participants (age: 25 ± 3 years, 4 women) completed our study. Six pliable bags, each containing water or an ice slurry (34<sup>o</sup>C, 28<sup>o</sup>C, 21<sup>o</sup>C, 14<sup>o</sup>C, 7<sup>o</sup>C, and 0<sup>o</sup>C) were applied sequentially to participants' forehead, eyes, and cheeks for 5 minutes each. Mean arterial pressure (photoplethysmography; index of sympathetic activity) and heart rhythm (3-lead ECG) were averaged in 1-minute increments at the end of baseline and throughout each temperature condition. Heart rate variability in the time (root mean square of successive differences; RMSSD) and frequency (high frequency (HF) power) domains were used to estimate cardiac parasympathetic activity. Data are presented as the increase from baseline ± SD. Mean arterial pressure only increased from baseline in the 7<sup>o</sup>C (13.1 ± 10.3 mmHg; <i>p</i>=0.018) and 0<sup>o</sup>C (25.2 ± 7.8 mmHg; <i>p</i><0.001) conditions. Only the 0<sup>o</sup>C condition increased RMSSD (160.6 ± 208.9 ms; <i>p</i>=0.009) and HF power (11450 ± 14555 ms<sup>2</sup>; <i>p</i>=0.014) from baseline. Our data indicate that peak increases in sympathetic activity during face cooling are initiated at a higher forehead skin temperature than peak increases in cardiac parasympathetic activity.

Title: Differentiation of isomeric chalcone and dihydroflavone using liquid chromatography coupled with hydrogen-deuterium exchange tandem mass spectrometry (HDX-MS/MS): An application for flavonoids-focused characterization of Snow chrysanthemum.
Abstract: Although the co-occurrences of isomeric chalcones and dihydroflavones widely appear in medicinal plants, the differentiation of such isomerism seldom succeeds using MS/MS, attributing to totally identical MS/MS spectra. Here, efforts were paid to pursue an eligible tool allowing to address the technical challenge. Being inspired by that one more proton signal is observed in <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of isoliquiritigenin than liquiritigenin when employing DMSO‑d<sub>6</sub> as solvent, hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX)-MS/MS was evaluated towards differentiating isomeric chalcones and dihydroflavones through replacing H<sub>2</sub>O with D<sub>2</sub>O to prepare the mobile phase. As a result, differences were observed for either MS<sup>1</sup> or MS<sup>2</sup> spectrum when comparing two pairs of isomers, such as liquiritigenin vs. isoliquiritigenin and liquiritin vs. isoliquiritin, because the isomeric precursor and fragment ion species owned different amounts of hydroxyl protons and those reactive protons could be partially or completely substituted by deuterium protons at the exposure in D<sub>2</sub>O to result in n × 1.006 mass increments. Moreover, utmost four hydrogen/deuterium exchanges occurred for a single glucosyl moiety. Thereafter, HDX-MS/MS was applied to characterize the flavonoids of Snow chrysanthemum, a precious edible herbal medicine that is rich in isomeric chalcones and dihydroflavones. Through paying special attention to the deuterium labeling styles of (de)protonated molecules as well as those featured fragment ions, five pairs of isomeric chalcones and dihydroflavones were confirmatively differentiated, in addition to that 28 flavonoids were structurally annotated by applying those well-defined mass fragmentation rules. Hence, this study offered an in-depth insight towards the flavonoids-focused characterization of Snow chrysanthemum, and more importantly, HDX-MS/MS is a superior tool to differentiate, but not limited to, isomeric chalcones and dihydroflavones.

Title: Metabolic and elemental profiling as potential discriminating features among the black mahlab seeds (Monechma ciliatum) grown in three different regions.
Abstract: Black mahlab (Monechma ciliatum) seed is a rich source of metabolites and minerals and is usually believed to have a similar composition between different areas of cultivation. Until now, no studies have assessed changes in black mahlab seeds (BMSs) to determine those constituents that help to discriminate them according to geographical origin.

Title: Intelligent chemical profiling of 73 edible flowers by liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry combined with HRMS database and their authentication based on large-scale fingerprints.
Abstract: A commercial high-resolution MS database "TCM-PCDL" was innovatively introduced to automatically identify multi-components in 73 edible flowers rapidly and accurately by liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry, which can be time-consuming and labor-intensive in traditional manual method. The database encompasses over 2565 natural products with various energy levels. Unknown compounds can be identified through direct matching and scoring MS<sup>2</sup> spectra with database. A total of 870 compounds were identified from 73 flowers, with polyphenols constituting up to 75%. Focusing on polyphenols, a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was developed to generate fingerprints from 510 batches, establishing an "HPLC database" that enabled accurate authentication using similarity scores and rankings. This method demonstrated an accuracy rate of 100% when applied to 30 unknown samples. For flowers prone to confusion, additional statistical analysis methods could be employed as aids in authentication. This study provides valuable insights for large-scale sample chemical profiling and authentication.

Title: An adapted MS2-MCP system to visualize endogenous cytoplasmic mRNA with live imaging in Caenorhabditis elegans.
Abstract: Live imaging of RNA molecules constitutes an invaluable means to track the dynamics of mRNAs, but live imaging in Caenorhabditis elegans has been difficult to achieve. Endogenous transcripts have been observed in nuclei, but endogenous mRNAs have not been detected in the cytoplasm, and functional mRNAs have not been generated. Here, we have adapted live imaging methods to visualize mRNA in embryonic cells. We have tagged endogenous transcripts with MS2 hairpins in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) and visualized them after adjusting MS2 Coat Protein (MCP) expression. A reduced number of these transcripts accumulates in the cytoplasm, leading to loss-of-function phenotypes. In addition, during epithelial morphogenesis, MS2-tagged mRNAs for dlg-1 fail to associate with the adherens junction, as observed for untagged, endogenous mRNAs. These defects are reversed by inactivating the nonsense-mediated decay pathway. RNA accumulates in the cytoplasm, mutant phenotypes are rescued, and dlg-1 RNA associates with the adherens junction. These data suggest that MS2 repeats can induce the degradation of endogenous RNAs and alter their cytoplasmic distribution. Although our focus is RNAs expressed in epithelial cells during morphogenesis, we find that this method can be applied to other cell types and stages.

Title: Physiological characterization of single-gene lysis proteins.
Abstract: Single-strand RNA (ssRNA) and single-strand DNA phages elicit host lysis using a single gene, in each case designated as <i>sgl</i>. Of the 11 identified Sgls, three have been shown to be specific inhibitors of different steps in the pathway that supplies lipid II to the peptidoglycan (PG) biosynthesis machinery. These Sgls have been called "protein antibiotics" because the lytic event is a septal catastrophe indistinguishable from that caused by cell wall antibiotics. Here, we designate these as type I Sgls. In this formalism, the other eight Sgls are assigned to type II, the best-studied of which is protein L of the paradigm F-specific ssRNA phage MS2. Comparisons have suggested that type II Sgls have four sequence elements distinguished by hydrophobic and polar character. Environmental metatranscriptomics has revealed thousands of new ssRNA phage genomes, each of which presumably has an Sgl. Here, we describe methods to distinguish type I and type II Sgls. Using phase contrast microscopy, we show that both classes of Sgls cause the formation of blebs prior to lysis, but the location of the blebs differs significantly. In addition, we show that L and other type II Sgls do not inhibit the net synthesis of PG, as measured by radio-labeling of PG. Finally, we provide direct evidence that the Sgl from <i>Pseudomonas</i> phage PP7 is a type I Sgl, in support of a recent report based on a genetic selection. This shows that the putative four-element sequence structure suggested for L is not a reliable discriminator for the operational characterization of Sgls.
