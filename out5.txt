Title: Physiological characterization of single-gene lysis proteins.
Abstract: Single-strand RNA (ssRNA) and single-strand DNA phages elicit host lysis using a single gene, in each case designated as <i>sgl</i>. Of the 11 identified Sgls, three have been shown to be specific inhibitors of different steps in the pathway that supplies lipid II to the peptidoglycan (PG) biosynthesis machinery. These Sgls have been called "protein antibiotics" because the lytic event is a septal catastrophe indistinguishable from that caused by cell wall antibiotics. Here, we designate these as type I Sgls. In this formalism, the other eight Sgls are assigned to type II, the best-studied of which is protein L of the paradigm F-specific ssRNA phage MS2. Comparisons have suggested that type II Sgls have four sequence elements distinguished by hydrophobic and polar character. Environmental metatranscriptomics has revealed thousands of new ssRNA phage genomes, each of which presumably has an Sgl. Here, we describe methods to distinguish type I and type II Sgls. Using phase contrast microscopy, we show that both classes of Sgls cause the formation of blebs prior to lysis, but the location of the blebs differs significantly. In addition, we show that L and other type II Sgls do not inhibit the net synthesis of PG, as measured by radio-labeling of PG. Finally, we provide direct evidence that the Sgl from <i>Pseudomonas</i> phage PP7 is a type I Sgl, in support of a recent report based on a genetic selection. This shows that the putative four-element sequence structure suggested for L is not a reliable discriminator for the operational characterization of Sgls.

Title: Comparing the Fate and Transport of MS2 Bacteriophage and Sodium Fluorescein in a Karstic Chalk Aquifer.
Abstract: Groundwater flow and contaminant migration tracing is a vital method of identifying and characterising pollutant source-pathway-receptor linkages in karst aquifers. Bacteriophages are an attractive alternative tracer to non-reactive fluorescent dye tracers, as high titres (>10<sup>12</sup> pfu mL<sup>-1</sup>) can be safely released into the aquifer, offering improved tracer detectability. However, the interpretation of bacteriophage tracer breakthrough curves is complicated as their fate and transport are impacted by aquifer physicochemical conditions. A comparative tracer migration experiment was conducted in a peri-urban catchment in southeast England to characterise the behaviour of MS2 bacteriophage relative to sodium fluorescein dye in a karstic chalk aquifer. Tracers were released into a stream sink and detected at two abstraction boreholes located 3 km and 10 km away. At both sites, the loss of MS2 phage greatly exceeded that of the solute tracer. In contrast, the qualitative shape of the dye and phage breakthrough curves were visually very similar, suggesting that the bacteriophage arriving at each site was governed by comparable transport parameters to the non-reactive dye tracer. The colloid filtration theory was applied to explain the apparent contradiction of comparable tracer breakthrough patterns despite massive phage losses in the subsurface. One-dimensional transport models were also fitted to each breakthrough curve to facilitate a quantitative comparison of the transport parameter values. The model results suggest that the bacteriophage migrates through the conduit system slightly faster than the fluorescent dye, but that the former is significantly less dispersed. These results suggest that whilst the bacteriophage tracer cannot be used to predict receptor concentrations from transport via karstic flow paths, it can provide estimates for groundwater flow and solute contaminant transit times. This study also provides insight into the attenuation and transport of pathogenic viruses in karstic chalk aquifers.

Title: Mitigation of viruses of concern and bacteriophage surrogates via common unit processes for water reuse: A meta-analysis.
Abstract: Water reuse is a growing global reality. In regulating water reuse, viruses have come to the fore as key pathogens due to high shedding rates, low infectious doses, and resilience to traditional wastewater treatments. To demonstrate the high log reductions required by emerging water reuse regulations, cost and practicality necessitate surrogates for viruses for use as challenge organisms in unit process evaluation and monitoring. Bacteriophage surrogates that are mitigated to the same or lesser extent than viruses of concern are routinely used for individual unit process testing. However, the behavior of these surrogates over a multi-barrier treatment train typical of water reuse has not been well-established. Toward this aim, we performed a meta-analysis of log reductions of common bacteriophage surrogates for five treatment processes typical of water reuse treatment trains: advanced oxidation processes, chlorination, membrane filtration, ozonation, and ultraviolet (UV) disinfection. Robust linear regression was applied to identify a range of doses consistent with a given log reduction of bacteriophages and viruses of concern for each treatment process. The results were used to determine relative conservatism of surrogates. We found that no one bacteriophage was a representative or conservative surrogate for viruses of concern across all multi-barrier treatments (encompassing multiple mechanisms of virus mitigation). Rather, a suite of bacteriophage surrogates provides both a representative range of inactivation and information about the effectiveness of individual processes within a treatment train. Based on the abundance of available data and diversity of virus treatability using these five key water reuse treatment processes, bacteriophages MS2, phiX174, and Qbeta were recommended as a core suite of surrogates for virus challenge testing.

Title: Evaluation of woodchips-amended biosand filter for nitrate and MS2 bacteriophage reduction.
Abstract: In this study, two types of woodchip-amended biosand filters (Filter A sand: woodchip = 33%: 67% versus Filter B sand: woodchip = 50%: 50%, by volume) were constructed, and their abilities to remove MS2 bacteriophage and nitrate were investigated. The results indicated that Filter A and Filter B could reduce nitrate up to 40 and 36%, respectively, indicating that the nitrate reduction increased with the increase in woodchip proportion. The study underscores a positive correlation between nitrate reduction and proportional increase in woodchip content, implying the potential for fine-tuning nitrate removal by varying sand-woodchip compositions. W-BSFs could remove MS2 bacteriophage to 1.91-log10 (98.8%) by Filter A and 1.88-log10 (98.7%) by Filter B over 39 weeks. The difference in sand-woodchip proportion did not significantly impact the MS2 reduction, demonstrating that a single W-BSF can maintain its virus removal performance fairly well over a long-term period. These results indicated that the nitrate reduction could be adjusted by varying sand-woodchip contents without impacting virus removal performance. Microbial community analysis indicated that the nitrate removal by the W-BSFs could be attributed to the denitrifying bacteria, such as the family Streptomycetaceae, the genera Pseudomonas, and Bacillus, and relative abundances of the phylum Nitrospirae.

Title: Lateral flow immunoassay based on surface-enhanced Raman scattering using pH-induced phage-templated hierarchical plasmonic assembly for point-of-care diagnosis of infectious disease.
Abstract: The outbreak of emerging infectious diseases gave rise to the demand for reliable point-of-care testing methods to diagnose and manage those diseases in early onset. However, the current on-site testing methods including lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) suffer from the inaccurate diagnostic result due to the low sensitivity. Herein, we present the surface-enhanced Raman scattering-based lateral flow immunoassay (SERS-LFIA) by introducing phage-templated hierarchical plasmonic assembly (PHPA) nanoprobes to diagnose a contagious disease. The PHPA was fabricated using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) assembled on bacteriophage MS2, where inter-particle gap sizes can be adjusted by pH-induced morphological alteration of MS2 coat proteins to provide the maximum SERS amplification efficiency via plasmon coupling. The plasmonic probes based on the PHPA produce strong and reproducible SERS signal that leads to sensitive and reliable diagnostic results in SERS-LFIA. The developed SERS-LFIA targeting severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies for a proof of concept had <100 pg/mL detection limits with high specificity in serum, proving it as an effective diagnostic device for the infectious diseases. Clinical validation using human serum samples further confirmed that the PHPA-based SERS-LFIA can distinguish the patients with COVID-19 from healthy controls with significant accuracy. These outcomes prove that the developed SERS-LFIA biosensor can be an alternative point-of-care testing (POCT) method against the emerging infectious diseases, in combination with the commercially available portable Raman devices.

Title: Biological Properties of Recently Described Wild Bramble <i>Rubus oklejewiczii</i> against the Species from Similar Niches.
Abstract: The aim of this study was to compare the biological properties, such as antiviral, antibacterial, and antioxidant, of recently described pentaploid species <i>Rubus oklejewiczii</i> with tetraploid taxa growing in similar habitats including <i>R. plicatus</i>, <i>R. gracilis</i>, and <i>R. wimmerianus</i>. The antiviral potential was analyzed against bacteriophages with different genetic material: phi6 (a surrogate for the SARS-CoV-2 virus), T7, phiX174, and MS2. Antibacterial properties of fruit and leaf extracts were determined against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Bacillus cereus</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and <i>Salmonella enterica</i>. The total phenolic content, as well as anthocyanins, ascorbic acid, pH, and antioxidant properties (FRAP and DPPH) were determined. <i>R. oklejewiczii</i> leaf extract was characterized by the weakest antibacterial and antiviral properties, which was closely correlated with the lowest content of polyphenolic compounds and antioxidant properties. The strongest biological properties were observed for <i>R. wimmerianus</i> leaves. Fruit extracts were characterized by lower phenolic content and antioxidant activities than leaves, with the lowest values observed for <i>R. oklejewiczii</i> extract. The antibacterial properties of fruit extracts were strongest for <i>R. gracilis</i>. The strongest antiviral potential was observed for <i>R. oklejewiczii</i> and <i>R. wimmerianus</i> fruit extracts against the bacteriophage phi6, which correlated with the lowest pH and the highest ascorbic acid content. The positive effect of the higher ploidy of <i>R. oklejewiczii</i> for most of the analyzed biological properties was not observed except for the antiviral potential of fruit extract. Due to its large and tasty fruits, this species seems to be very promising for cultivation and attractive for consumers, even though most of its biological properties were not any better compared to other examined tetraploid species.

Title: Effect of coat-protein concentration on the self-assembly of bacteriophage MS2 capsids around RNA.
Abstract: Self-assembly is a vital part of the life cycle of certain icosahedral RNA viruses. Furthermore, the assembly process can be harnessed to make icosahedral virus-like particles (VLPs) from coat protein and RNA <i>in vitro</i>. Although much previous work has explored the effects of RNA-protein interactions on the assembly products, relatively little research has explored the effects of coat-protein concentration. We mix coat protein and RNA from bacteriophage MS2, and we use a combination of gel electrophoresis, dynamic light scattering, and transmission electron microscopy to investigate the assembly products. We show that with increasing coat-protein concentration, the products transition from well-formed MS2 VLPs to "monster" particles consisting of multiple partial capsids to RNA-protein condensates consisting of large networks of RNA and partially assembled capsids. We argue that the transition from well-formed to monster particles arises because the assembly follows a nucleation-and-growth pathway in which the nucleation rate depends sensitively on the coat-protein concentration, such that at high protein concentrations, multiple nuclei can form on each RNA strand. To understand the formation of the condensates, which occurs at even higher coat-protein concentrations, we use Monte Carlo simulations with coarse-grained models of capsomers and RNA. These simulations suggest that the formation of condensates occurs by the adsorption of protein to the RNA followed by the assembly of capsids. Multiple RNA molecules can become trapped when a capsid grows from capsomers attached to two different RNA molecules or when excess protein bridges together growing capsids on different RNA molecules. Our results provide insight into an important biophysical process and could inform design rules for making VLPs for various applications.

Title: A Novel Thermostable and Processive Reverse Transcriptase from a Group II Intron of <i>Anoxybacillus flavithermus</i>.
Abstract: Reverse transcriptases (RTs) are a family of enzymes that synthesize DNA using an RNA template and are involved in retrovirus propagation and telomere lengthening. In vitro, RTs are widely applied in various methods, including RNA-seq, RT-PCR, and RT-LAMP. Thermostable RTs from bacterial group II introns are promising tools for biotechnology due to their higher thermostability, fidelity, and processivity compared to commonly used M-MuLV RT and its mutants. However, the diversity of group II intron-encoded RTs is still understudied. In this work, we biochemically characterized a novel RT from a thermophilic bacterium, <i>Anoxybacillus flavithermus</i>, which was isolated from a hot spring in New Zealand and has an optimal growth temperature of around 60 °C. The cloned RT, named Afl RT, retained approximately 40% of the specific activity after a 45 min incubation at 50 °C. The optimal pH was 8.5, the optimal temperature was between 45 and 50 °C, and Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions were found to be an optimal cofactor. The processivity analysis with MS2 phage gRNA (3569 b) demonstrated that Afl RT elongated fully up to 36% of the template molecules. In reverse transcription and RT-qLAMP, the enzyme allowed up to 10 copies of MS2 phage genomic RNA to be detected per reaction. Thus, Afl RT holds great potential for a variety of practical applications that require the use of thermostable and processive RTs.

Title: Aggregation-Induced Emission-Armored Living Bacteriophage-DNA Nanobioconjugates for Targeting, Imaging, and Efficient Elimination of Intracellular Bacterial Infection.
Abstract: Intracellular bacterial infections bring a considerable risk to human life and health due to their capability to elude immune defenses and exhibit significant drug resistance. As a result, confronting and managing these infections present substantial challenges. In this study, we developed a multifunctional living phage nanoconjugate by integrating aggregation-induced emission luminogen (AIEgen) photosensitizers and nucleic acids onto a bacteriophage framework (forming MS2-DNA-AIEgen bioconjugates). These nanoconjugates can rapidly penetrate mammalian cells and specifically identify intracellular bacteria while concurrently producing a detectable fluorescent signal. By harnessing the photodynamic property of AIEgen photosensitizer and the bacteriophage's inherent targeting and lysis capability, the intracellular bacteria can be effectively eliminated and the activity of the infected cells can be restored. Moreover, our engineered phage nanoconjugates were able to expedite the healing process in bacterially infected wounds observed in diabetic mice models while simultaneously enhancing immune activity within infected cells and <i>in vivo</i>, without displaying noticeable toxicity. We envision that these multifunctional phage nanoconjugates, which utilize AIEgen photosensitizers and spherical nucleic acids, may present a groundbreaking strategy for combating intracellular bacteria and offer powerful avenues for theranostic applications in intracellular bacterial infection-associated diseases.

Title: Ozone and photodynamic inactivation of norovirus surrogate bacteriophage MS2 in fresh Brazilian berries and surfaces.
Abstract: This study assessed the efficacy of ozone (bubble diffusion in water; 6.25 ppm) and photodynamic inactivation (PDT) using curcumin (75 μM) as photosensitizer (LED emission 430-470 nm; 33.6 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> irradiance; 16.1, 20.2, and 24.2 J/cm<sup>2</sup> light dose) against the Norovirus surrogate bacteriophage MS2 in Brazilian berries (black mulberry and pitanga) and surfaces (glass and stainless steel). Contaminated berries and surfaces were immersed in ozonized water or exposed to PDT-curcumin for different time intervals. Transmission electron microscopy was used to assess the effects of the treatments on MS2 viral particles. The MS2 inactivation by ozone and PDT-curcumin varied with the fruit and the surface tested. Ozone reduced the MS2 titer up to 3.6 log PFU/g in black mulberry and 4.1 log PFU/g in pitanga. On surfaces, the MS2 reduction by ozone reached 3.6 and 4.8 log PFU/cm<sup>2</sup> on glass and stainless steel, respectively. PDT-curcumin reduced the MS2 3.2 and 4.8 log PFU/g in black mulberry and pitanga and 2.7 and 3.3 log PFU/cm<sup>2</sup> on glass and stainless steel, respectively. MS2 particles were disintegrated by exposure of MS2 to ozone and PDT-curcumin on pitanga.

Title: Microplastics as potential barriers to ultraviolet light emitting diode inactivation of MS2 bacteriophage: Influence of water-quality parameters.
Abstract: Microplastics have emerged as a concerning contaminant in drinking water sources, potentially interacting with pathogenic microorganisms and affecting the disinfection processes. In this study, MS2 was selected as an alternative for the human enteric virus. The influence of microplastics polyvinylchloride (MPs-PVC) on ultraviolet light emitting diode (UV-LED) inactivation of MS2 was investigated under various water chemistry conditions, such as MPs-PVC concentration, pH, salinity, and humic acid concentration. The results revealed that higher concentrations of MPs-PVC led to the reduced inactivation of MS2 by decreased UV transmittance, hindering the disinfection process. Additionally, the inactivation efficiency of MS2 in the presence of MPs-PVC was influenced by pH, and acidic solution (pH at 4, 5, and 6) exhibited higher efficiency compared to alkaline solution (pH at 8 and 9) and neutral solution (pH at 7). The low Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations (0-50 mM) had a noticeable effect on MS2 inaction efficiency in the presence of MPs-PVC, while the addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> posed an insignificant effect due to the preferential interaction with MPs-PVC. Furthermore, the inactivation rate of MS2 initially increased and then decreased with increasing the concentration of humic acid, which was significantly different without MPs-PVC. These findings shed light on the complex interactions between MPs-PVC and MS2 in the UV-LED disinfection process under various water-quality parameters, contributing to drinking water safety and treatment.

Title: Insights of phytoremediation mechanisms for viruses based on in-vitro, in-vivo and in-silico assessments of selected herbal plants.
Abstract: Waterborne pathogenic viruses present unrelenting challenges to the global health and wastewater treatment industry. Phytoremediation offers promising solutions for wastewater treatment through plant-based technologies. This study investigated antiviral mechanisms in-vivo using bacteriophages MS2 and T4 as surrogates for effective herbs screened in-vitro from three embryophytes (Ocimum basilicum, Mentha sp., Plectranthus amboinicus), two macrophytes (Eichhornia crassipes, Pistia stratiotes) and a perennial grass (Cyperus rotundas). In-silico virtual screening predicted antiviral phytochemicals for further antiviral potency assessment. Results suggested in-vitro antiviral activities of embryophytes and macrophytes were higher (43-62%) than grass (21-26%). O. basilicum (OB, 57-62%) and P. stratiotes (PS, 59-60%) exhibited the highest antiviral activities. In-vivo tests showed notable virus reduction (>60%) in culture solution, attributed to rhizofiltration (66-74%) and phytoinactivation/phytodegradation (63-84%). In-silico analysis identified rutin as a primary antiviral phytochemical for MS2 (-9.7 kcal/mol) and T4 (-10.9 kcal/mol), correlating with dose-response inactivation (∼58-62%). In-vivo tests suggested additional phytocompounds may contribute to viral inactivation, presenting new opportunities for herb-based wastewater treatment solutions. Consequently, this study not only demonstrates the antiviral capabilities of OB and PS but also introduces an innovative approach for addressing viral contaminants in water.

Title: Phage cocktail alleviated type 2 diabetes by reshaping gut microbiota and decreasing proinflammatory cytokines.
Abstract: Type 2 diabetes (T2D), a global health concern, is closely associated with the gut microbiota. Restoration of a balanced microbiota and intestinal homeostasis benefit therapy of T2D. Some special phages may selectively alter the gut microbiota without causing dysbiosis, such as MS2 and P22. However, scarcely systematic analysis of cascading effects triggered by MS2 and P22 phages on the microbiota, as well as interactions between specific gut bacteria and systemic metabolism, seriously inhibit the development of positive interventions of phages. Based on multi-omic analysis, we analyzed the intrinsic correlations among specific microbiota, their bioactive metabolites, and key indicators of T2D. We found that gavage of the MS2-P22 phage cocktail could significantly alter the gut microbiome to attenuate dysbiosis of diabetic C57BL/6 mice caused by high-fat diets (HFDs) and streptozotocin (STZ), by affecting microbial compositions as well as their metabolic pathways and metabolites, especially increasing amounts of short-chain fatty acid-producing (SCFA-producing) bacteria (e.g., Blautia and Romboutsia) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Correspondingly, a noteworthy reduction in the number of several opportunistic pathogens occurred, e.g., Candidatus Saccharimonas, Aerococcus, Oscillibacter, Desulfovibrio, and Clostridium sensu stricto 1. Synchronously, the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were reduced to recover gut barrier function in T2D mice. These findings might benefit the development of a new dietary intervention for T2D based on phage cocktails.

Title: Approaching easy water disinfection for all: Can in situ electrochlorination outperform conventional chlorination under realistic conditions?
Abstract: Electrochlorination has gained research interest for its potential application as decentralized water treatment. A number of studies have displayed promising efficiency for water disinfection. However, a comprehensive comparison of in situ electrodisinfection to existing disinfection techniques, particularly under realistic water composition and flow rates, still needs additional research efforts. The aim of this study is to evaluate in situ electrochlorination while comparing the treatment with conventional chemical chlorination for point-of-entry decentralized disinfection at the household level. An electrochemical flow cell reactor was operated in a single pass mode considering water flow and water consumption for a household of four family members. Disinfection efficiency assessment of both electrochemical and chemical chlorination was conducted using bacterial and viral surrogates, E. coli and MS2 bacteriophage. Furthermore, a techno-economic analysis was conducted, using the levelized cost of water, to compare two electrochemical chlorination scenarios (i.e., electrical grid energy use, and solar panel powered system) and benchmarked against the baseline treatment of chemical chlorination. The findings revealed increased inactivation efficiency of in situ electrochlorination over conventional chlorination (p-value < 0.05). The synergetic impact of radicals and chlorine, and/or contribution of high chlorine concentration at acidic pH near anode surface were identified as key factors that could enhance disinfection performance of in situ electrochlorination. The techno-economic analysis demonstrated that electrochemical treatment, when operated using renewable energy sources, is not only a more environmentally sustainable approach, but also emerges as a more economically feasible solution for decentralized water treatment application. The results highlight that in situ electrochlorination is a more advanced alternative to decentralized water chlorination. However, further fundamental research on products and by-products formation under various water matrices is required.

The sequence encoding one copy of maturase, His-tag and coat protein dimer was cloned and inserted into MCS1 of the plasmid; the fragment encoding protein N and ORF1ab from SARS-CoV-2 was cloned and inserted into MCS2. The prepared plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL2 (DE3), and expression of the construct was induced by 1 mM isopropyl-L-thio-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) at 30°C for 12 hours. MS2 VLPs were purified and collected with Ni-NTA affinity chromatography columns. The size and shape of the MS2 VLPs were verified by transmission electron microscopy, and the stability of MS2 VLP packaged RNA was evaluated by treatment with RNase A. Effects of storage temperature and buffer on MS2 VLP stability were also investigated. The results showed that SARS-CoV-2 MS2 VLPs could be successfully produced by this one-plasmid double-expression system. MS2 VLPs showed high stability and may be used as a positive control in molecular diagnosis of COVID-19.

Title: Implementation of a Sensitive Method to Assess High Virus Retention Performance of Low-Pressure Reverse Osmosis Process.
Abstract: Human enteric viruses are important etiological agents of waterborne diseases. Environmental waters are usually contaminated with low virus concentration requiring large concentration factors for effective detection by (RT)-qPCR. Low-pressure reverse osmosis is often used to remove water contaminants, but very few studies focused on the effective virus removal of reverse osmosis treatment with feed concentrations as close as possible to environmental concentrations and principally relied on theoretical virus removal. The very low viral concentrations usually reported in the permeates (i.e. at least 5 log of removal rate) mean that very large volumes of water need to be analysed to have sufficient sensitivity and assess the process efficiency. This study evaluates two methods for the concentration of adenoviruses, enteroviruses and MS2 bacteriophages at different viral concentrations in large (< 200 L) and very large (> 200 L) volumes. The first method is composed of two ultrafiltration membranes with low-molecular weight cut-offs while the second method primarily relies on adsorption and elution phases using electropositive-charged filters. The recovery rates were assessed for both methods. For the ultrafiltration-based protocol, recovery rates were similar for each virus studied: 80% on average at high virus concentrations (10<sup>6</sup>-10<sup>7</sup> viruses L<sup>-1</sup>) and 50% at low virus concentrations (10<sup>3</sup>-10<sup>4</sup> viruses L<sup>-1</sup>). For the electropositive-charged filter-based method, the average recoveries obtained were about 36% for ADV 41, 57% for CV-B5 and 1.6% for MS2. The ultrafiltration-based method was then used to evaluate the performance of a low-pressure reverse osmosis lab-scale pilot plant. The retentions by reverse osmosis were similar for all studied viruses and the validated recovery rates applied to the system confirmed the reliability of the concentration method. This method was effective in concentrating all three viruses over a wide range of viral concentrations. Moreover, the second concentration method using electropositive-charged filters was studied, allowing the filtration of larger volumes of permeate from a semi-industrial low-pressure reverse osmosis pilot plant. This reference method was used because of the inability of the UF method to filter volumes on the order of one cubic metre.

Title: Droplet-based methodology for investigating bacterial population dynamics in response to phage exposure.
Abstract: An alarming rise in antimicrobial resistance worldwide has spurred efforts into the search for alternatives to antibiotic treatments. The use of bacteriophages, bacterial viruses harmless to humans, represents a promising approach with potential to treat bacterial infections (phage therapy). Recent advances in microscopy-based single-cell techniques have allowed researchers to develop new quantitative methodologies for assessing the interactions between bacteria and phages, especially the ability of phages to eradicate bacterial pathogen populations and to modulate growth of both commensal and pathogen populations. Here we combine droplet microfluidics with fluorescence time-lapse microscopy to characterize the growth and lysis dynamics of the bacterium <i>Escherichia coli</i> confined in droplets when challenged with phage. We investigated phages that promote lysis of infected <i>E. coli</i> cells, specifically, a phage species with DNA genome, T7 (<i>Escherichia virus T7</i>) and two phage species with RNA genomes, MS2 (<i>Emesvirus zinderi</i>) and Qβ (<i>Qubevirus durum</i>). Our microfluidic trapping device generated and immobilized picoliter-sized droplets, enabling stable imaging of bacterial growth and lysis in a temperature-controlled setup. Temporal information on bacterial population size was recorded for up to 25 h, allowing us to determine growth rates of bacterial populations and helping us uncover the extent and speed of phage infection. In the long-term, the development of novel microfluidic single-cell and population-level approaches will expedite research towards fundamental understanding of the genetic and molecular basis of rapid phage-induced lysis and eco-evolutionary aspects of bacteria-phage dynamics, and ultimately help identify key factors influencing the success of phage therapy.

Title: RNA Aptamer-Mediated Gene Activation Systems for Inducible Transgene Expression in Animal Cells.
Abstract: RNA expression analyses can be used to obtain various information from inside cells, such as physical conditions, the chemical environment, and endogenous signals. For detecting RNA, the system regulating intracellular gene expression has the potential for monitoring RNA expression levels in real time within living cells. Synthetic biology provides powerful tools for detecting and analyzing RNA inside cells. Here, we devised an RNA aptamer-mediated gene activation system, RAMGA, to induce RNA-triggered gene expression activation by employing an inducible complex formation strategy grounded in synthetic biology. This methodology connects DNA-binding domains and transactivators through target RNA using RNA-binding domains, including phage coat proteins. MS2 bacteriophage coat protein fused with a transcriptional activator and PP7 bacteriophage coat protein fused with the tetracycline repressor (tetR) can be bridged by target RNA encoding MS2 and PP7 stem-loops, resulting in transcriptional activation. We generated recombinant CHO cells containing an inducible GFP expression module governed by a minimal promoter with a tetR-responsive element. Cells carrying the trigger RNA exhibited robust reporter gene expression, whereas cells lacking it exhibited no expression. GFP expression was upregulated over 200-fold compared with that in cells without a target RNA expression vector. Moreover, this system can detect the expression of mRNA tagged with aptamer tags and modulate reporter gene expression based on the target mRNA level without affecting the expression of the original mRNA-encoding gene. The RNA-triggered gene expression systems developed in this study have potential as a new platform for establishing gene circuits, evaluating endogenous gene expression, and developing novel RNA detectors.

Title: <i>In vitro</i> characterization of the phage lysis protein MS2-L.
Abstract: <b>Background:</b> The peptide MS2-L represents toxins of the ssRNA Leviviridae phage family and consists of a predicted N-terminal soluble domain followed by a transmembrane domain. MS2-L mediates bacterial cell lysis through the formation of large lesions in the cell envelope, but further details of this mechanism as a prerequisite for applied bioengineering studies are lacking. The chaperone DnaJ is proposed to modulate MS2-L activity, whereas other cellular targets of MS2-L are unknown. <b>Methods:</b> Here, we provide a combined <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> overexpression approach to reveal molecular insights into MS2-L action and its interaction with DnaJ. Full-length MS2-L and truncated derivatives were synthesized cell-free and co-translationally inserted into nanodiscs or solubilized in detergent micelles. By native liquid bead ion desorption mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that MS2-L assembles into high oligomeric states after membrane insertion. <b>Results:</b> Oligomerization is directed by the transmembrane domain and is impaired in detergent environments. Studies with truncated MS2-L derivatives provide evidence that the soluble domain acts as a modulator of oligomer formation. DnaJ strongly interacts with MS2-L in membranes as well as in detergent environments. However, this interaction affects neither the MS2-L membrane insertion efficiency nor its oligomerization in nanodisc membranes. In accordance with the in vitro data, the assembly of MS2-L derivatives into large membrane located clusters was monitored by overexpression of corresponding fusions with fluorescent monitors in <i>E. coli</i> cells. Analysis by cryo-electron microscopy indicates that lesion formation is initiated in the outer membrane, followed by disruption of the peptidoglycan layer and disintegration of the inner membrane. <b>Conclusion:</b> MS2-L forms oligomeric complexes similar to the related phage toxin ΦX174-E. The oligomeric interface of both peptides is located within their transmembrane domains. We propose a potential function of the higher-order assembly of small phage toxins in membrane disintegration and cell lysis.

Title: Partitioning and inactivation of enveloped and nonenveloped viruses in activated sludge, anaerobic and microalgae-based wastewater treatment systems.
Abstract: Anaerobic and microalgae-based technologies for municipal wastewater treatment have emerged as sustainable alternatives to activated sludge systems. However, viruses are a major sanitary concern for reuse applications of liquid and solid byproducts from these technologies. To assess their capacity to reduce viruses during secondary wastewater treatment, enveloped Phi6 and nonenveloped MS2 bacteriophages, typically used as surrogates of several types of wastewater viruses, were spiked into batch bioreactors treating synthetic municipal wastewater (SMWW). The decay of Phi6 and MS2 in anaerobic and microalgae-based reactors was compared with the decay in activated sludge batch reactors for 96 h (Phi6) and 144 h (MS2). In each reactor, bacteriophages in the soluble and solids fractions were titered, allowing the assessment of virus partitioning to biomass over time. Moreover, the influence of abiotic conditions such as agitation, oxygen absence and light excess in activated sludge, anaerobic and microalgae reactors, respectively, was assessed using dedicated SMWW control reactors. All technologies showed Phi6 and MS2 reductions. Phi6 was reduced in at least 4.7 to 6.5 log<sub>10</sub> units, with 0 h concentrations ranging from 5.0 to 6.5 log<sub>10</sub> PFU mL<sup>-1</sup>. Similarly, reductions achieved for MS2 were of at least 3.9 to 7.2 log<sub>10</sub> units, from starting concentrations of 8.0 to 8.6 log<sub>10</sub> PFU mL<sup>-1</sup>. Log-logistic models adjusted to bacteriophages' decay indicated T<sub>90</sub> values in activated sludge and microalgae reactors of 2.2 and 7.9 h for Phi6 and of 1.0 and 11.5 h for MS2, respectively, all within typical hydraulic retention times (HRT) of full-scale operation. In the case of the microalgae technology, T<sub>99</sub> values for Phi6 and MS2 of 12.7 h and 13.6 h were also lower than typical operating HRTs (2-10 d), while activated sludge and anaerobic treatment achieved less than 99 % of Phi6 and 50 % of MS2 inactivation within 12 h of typical HRT, respectively. Thus, the microalgae-based treatment exhibited a higher potential to reduce the disinfection requirements of treated wastewater.

Title: Bacteriophage Virus-Like Particles: Platforms for Vaccine Design.
Abstract: Virus-like particles (VLPs) derived from bacteriophages have many applications in biomedical sciences, especially in the development of candidate vaccines against viral and bacterial infections. Bacteriophage VLPs can be manufactured cheaply and in large quantities in bacteria compared to eukaryotic expression systems. In addition to this, bacteriophage VLPs are excellent platforms for vaccine design for the following reason: Humans do not have preexisting antibodies against bacteriophage VLPs. Thus, antigens displayed on bacteriophage VLP platforms are expected to be highly immunogenic. As such, VLPs derived from MS2, PP7, Qβ, AP205, P22 bacteriophages, etc. have been used to develop candidate vaccines against human infectious and noninfectious agents. This mini-review summarizes data from some of the candidate bacteriophage-based VLP peptide vaccines that have been developed. The review also highlights some strategies used to develop the candidate bacteriophage-based VLP peptide vaccines.

Title: Physiological characterization of single gene lysis proteins.
Abstract: Until recently only 11 distinct Sgls (single gene lysis proteins) have been experimentally identified. Of these, three have been shown to be specific inhibitors of different steps in the pathway that supplies Lipid II to the peptidoglycan (PG) biosynthesis machinery: Qβ A<sub>2</sub> inhibits MurA, ϕX174 E inhibits MraY, and Lys from coliphage M inhibits MurJ. These Sgls have been called "protein antibiotics" because the lytic event is a septal catastrophe indistinguishable from that caused by cell wall antibiotics. Here we propose to designate these as members of type I Sgls, to distinguish them from another Sgl, the L protein of the paradigm ssRNA phage MS2. Although none of the other distinct Sgls have significant sequence similarity to L, alignments suggested the presence of four domains distinguished by hydrophobic and polar character. The simplest notion is that these other Sgls have the same autolytic mechanism and, based on this, constitute type II. Although the number of experimentally confirmed Sgls has not changed, recent environmental metagenomes and metatranscriptomes have revealed thousands of new ssRNA phage genomes, each of which presumably has at least one Sgl gene. Here we report on methods to distinguish type I and type II Sgls. Using phase-contrast microscopy, we show that both classes of Sgls cause the formation of blebs prior to lysis, but the location of the blebs differs significantly. In addition, we show that L and other type II Sgls do not inhibit net synthesis of PG, as measured by incorporation of <sup>3</sup>[H]-diaminopimelic acid. Finally, we provide support for the unexpected finding by Adler and colleagues that the Sgl from Pseudomonas phage PP7 is a type I Sgl, as determined by the two methods. This shows that the sharing the putative 4-domain structure suggested for L is not a reliable discriminator for operational characterization of Sgls. Overall, this study establishes new ways to rapidly classify novel Sgls and thus may facilitate the identification of new cell envelope targets that will help generate new antibiotics.

Title: Complete Virion Simulated: All-Atom Model of an MS2 Bacteriophage with Native Genome.
Abstract: For the first time, a complete all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) model of a virus, bacteriophage MS2, in its entirety, including a protein outer shell, native genomic RNA with necessary divalent ions, and surrounding explicit aqueous solution with ions at physiological concentration, was built. The model is based on an experimentally measured cryo-EM structure, which was substantially augmented by reconstructing missing or low-resolution parts of the measured density (where the atomistic structure cannot be fit unambiguously). The model was tested by a quarter of a microsecond MD run, and various biophysical characteristics are obtained and analyzed. The developed methodology of building the model can be used for reconstructing other large biomolecular structures when experimental data are fragmented and/or of varying resolution, while the model itself can be used for studying the biology of MS2, including the dynamics of its interaction with the host bacteria.

Title: An Approach for Antigen-Agnostic Identification of Virus-Like Particle-Displayed Epitopes that Engage Specific Antibody V Gene Regions.
Abstract: Antibody complementarity determining regions (CDRs) participate in antigen recognition, but not all participate equally in antigen binding. Here we describe a technique for discovering strong, specific binding partners to defined motifs within the CDRs of chimeric, engineered antibodies using affinity selection and counter-selection of epitopes displayed on bacteriophage MS2-based virus-like particles (VLPs). As an example, we show how this technique can be used to identify families of VLPs that interact with antibodies displaying the CDRs encoded by the germline precursor of a broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody against HIV-1.

Title: Performance comparison of photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy with visible-light-activated organic dyes: Rose bengal, crystal violet, methylene blue, and toluidine blue O.
Abstract: This study evaluated the photobiocidal performance of four widely distributed visible-light-activated (VLA) dyes against two bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli) and two bacteriophages (phages MS2 and phi 6): rose bengal (RB), crystal violet, methylene blue, and toluidine blue O (TBO). The photobiocidal performance of each dye depended on the relationship between the type of dye and microorganism. Gram-negative E. coli and the non-enveloped structure of phage MS2 showed more resistance to the photobiocidal reaction than Gram-positive S. epidermidis and the enveloped structure of phage phi 6. RB had the highest potential to yield reactive oxygen species. However, the photobiocidal performance of RB was dependent on the magnitude of the surface charge of the microorganisms; for example, anionic RB induced a negative surface charge and thus electrical repulsion. On the other hand, the photobiocidal performance of TBO was observed to be less affected by the microorganism type. The comparative results presented in our study have significant implications for selecting photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy (PACT) dyes suitable for specific situations and purposes. Furthermore, they contribute to the advancement of PACT-related technologies by enhancing their applicability and scalability.

Title: Positive interactions among Corynebacterium glutamicum and keystone bacteria producing SCFAs benefited T2D mice to rebuild gut eubiosis.
Abstract: Accumulating evidences strongly support the correlations between the compositions of gut microbiome and therapeutic effects on Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Notably, gut microbes such as Akkermansia muciniphila are found able to regulate microecological balance and alleviate dysmetabolism of mice bearing T2D. In order to search out similarly functional bacteria, bacteriophage MS2 with a good specificity to bacteria carrying fertility (F) factor were used to treat T2D mice. Based on multi-omics analysis of microbiome and global metabolism of mice, we observed that gavage of bacteriophage MS2 and metformin led to a significant increase in the abundance of Corynebacterium glutamicum and A. muciniphila, respectively. Consequently, the gut microbiota were remodeled, leading to variations in metabolites and a substantial increase in short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). In which, the amount of acetate, propionate, and butyrate presented negative correlations to that of proinflammatory cytokines, which was beneficial to repairing the intestinal barriers and improving their functions. Moreover, main short fatty acid (SCFA) producers exhibited positive interactions, further facilitating the restoration of gut eubiosis. These findings revealed that C. glutamicum and its metabolites may be potential dietary supplements for the treatment of T2D. Moreover, our research contributes to a novel understanding of the underlying mechanism by which functional foods exert their anti-diabetic effects.

Title: The Protective Effect of Virus Capsids on RNA and DNA Virus Genomes in Wastewater.
Abstract: Virus concentrations measured in municipal wastewater help inform both the water treatment necessary to protect human health and wastewater-based epidemiology. Wastewater measurements are typically PCR-based, and interpreting gene copy concentrations requires an understanding of the form and stability of the nucleic acids. Here, we study the persistence of model virus genomes in wastewater, the protective effects provided by the virus capsids, and the relative decay rates of the genome and infectious viruses. In benchtop batch experiments in wastewater influent at 25 °C, extraviral (+)ssRNA and dsDNA amplicons degraded by 90% within 15-19 min and 1.6-1.9 h, respectively. When encapsidated, the <i>T</i><sub>90</sub> for MS2 (+)ssRNA increased by 424× and the <i>T</i><sub>90</sub> for T4 dsDNA increased by 52×. The (+)ssRNA decay rates were similar for a range of amplicon sizes. For our model phages MS2 and T4, the nucleic acid signal in untreated wastewater disappeared shortly after the viruses lost infectivity. Combined, these results suggest that most viral genome copies measured in wastewater are encapsidated, that measured concentrations are independent of assay amplicon sizes, and that the virus genome decay rates of nonenveloped (i.e., naked) viruses are similar to inactivation rates. These findings are valuable for the interpretation of wastewater virus measurements.

Title: Fluence requirements in existing UV disinfection facilities to comply with EU validation performance targets for reclaimed water: a case study.
Abstract: Since 2020, there is a new European Regulation (EU, 2020/741) on minimum requirements for water reuse, where routine and validation monitoring requirements (log reductions of indicator microorganisms and reference pathogens) have been established. Many reclamation facilities that are already in operation might have difficulties to comply with these performance targets. Existing disinfection systems must be expanded and upgraded. In the case of UV disinfection systems, fluence requirements must be determined to properly design with a focus on the safety and economic-environmental viability of reclaimed water. This study can be used as a reference to develop fluence-response curves for Clostridium perfringens spores, Escherichia coli, and total and F-specific coliphages, indicator microorganisms referred to in the new European Regulation. Eight UV-LED collimated beam tests were performed. Samples were obtained from filtered effluent of secondary treatment from two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) which ranged between 30 and 54%. Results showed UV sensitivity of 33.46 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> log I for C. perfringens spores and 2.86 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> log I for E. coli, both from environmental origin. Coliphages were inactivated below the limit of quantitation. The non-dominance of MS2 phages in environmental F-specific coliphages was observed.

Title: Adsorption of Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Rhinovirus, SARS-CoV-2, and F+ Bacteriophage MS2 RNA onto Wastewater Solids from Raw Wastewater.
Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of wastewater surveillance, more research is needed to understand the fate and transport of viral genetic markers in wastewater. This information is essential for optimizing monitoring strategies and interpreting wastewater surveillance data. In this study, we examined the solid-liquid partitioning behavior of four viruses in wastewater: SARS-CoV-2, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), and F+ coliphage/MS2. We used two approaches: (1) laboratory partitioning experiments using lab-grown viruses and (2) distribution experiments using endogenous viruses in raw wastewater. Partition experiments were conducted at 4 and 22 °C. Wastewater samples were spiked with varying concentrations of each virus, solids and liquids were separated via centrifugation, and viral RNA concentrations were quantified using reverse-transcription-digital droplet PCR (RT-ddPCR). For the distribution experiments, wastewater samples were collected from six wastewater treatment plants and processed without spiking exogenous viruses; viral RNA concentrations were measured in wastewater solids and liquids. In both experiments, RNA concentrations were higher in the solid fraction than the liquid fraction by approximately 3-4 orders of magnitude. Partition coefficients (<i>K</i><sub>F</sub>) ranged from 2000-270,000 mL·g<sup>-1</sup> across viruses and temperature conditions. Distribution coefficients (<i>K</i><sub>d</sub>) were consistent with results from partitioning experiments. Further research is needed to understand how virus and wastewater characteristics might influence the partitioning of viral genetic markers in wastewater.

Title: Geochemical constraints on bacteriophage infectivity in terrestrial environments.
Abstract: Lytic phages can be potent and selective inhibitors of microbial growth and can have profound impacts on microbiome composition and function. However, there is uncertainty about the biogeochemical conditions under which phage predation modulates microbial ecosystem function, particularly in terrestrial systems. Ionic strength is critical for infection of bacteria by many phages, but quantitative data is limited on the ion thresholds for phage infection that can be compared with environmental ion concentrations. Similarly, while carbon composition varies in the environment, we do not know how this variability influences the impact of phage predation on microbiome function. Here, we measured the half-maximal effective concentrations (EC<sub>50</sub>) of 80 different inorganic ions for the infection of E. coli with two canonical dsDNA and ssRNA phages, T4 and MS2, respectively. Many alkaline earth metals and alkali metals enabled lytic infection but the ionic strength thresholds varied for different ions between phages. Additionally, using a freshwater nitrate-reducing microbiome, we found that the ability of lytic phages to influence nitrate reduction end-products depended upon the carbon source as well as ionic strength. For all phage:host pairs, the ion EC<sub>50</sub>s for phage infection exceeded the ion concentrations found in many terrestrial freshwater systems. Thus, our findings support a model where phages most influence terrestrial microbial functional ecology in hot spots and hot moments such as metazoan guts, drought influenced soils, or biofilms where ion concentration is locally or transiently elevated and nutrients are available to support the growth of specific phage hosts.

Title: Investigating the Prevalence of RNA-Binding Metabolic Enzymes in <i>E. coli</i>.
Abstract: An open research field in cellular regulation is the assumed crosstalk between RNAs, metabolic enzymes, and metabolites, also known as the REM hypothesis. High-throughput assays have produced extensive interactome data with metabolic enzymes frequently found as hits, but only a few examples have been biochemically validated, with deficits especially in prokaryotes. Therefore, we rationally selected nineteen <i>Escherichia coli</i> enzymes from such datasets and examined their ability to bind RNAs using two complementary methods, iCLIP and SELEX. Found interactions were validated by EMSA and other methods. For most of the candidates, we observed no RNA binding (12/19) or a rather unspecific binding (5/19). Two of the candidates, namely glutamate-5-kinase (ProB) and quinone oxidoreductase (QorA), displayed specific and previously unknown binding to distinct RNAs. We concentrated on the interaction of QorA to the mRNA of <i>yffO</i>, a grounded prophage gene, which could be validated by EMSA and MST. Because the physiological function of both partners is not known, the biological relevance of this interaction remains elusive. Furthermore, we found novel RNA targets for the MS2 phage coat protein that served us as control. Our results indicate that RNA binding of metabolic enzymes in procaryotes is less frequent than suggested by the results of high-throughput studies, but does occur.

Title: Evaluation of disinfection methods for personal protective equipment (PPE) items for reuse during a pandemic.
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in many supply chain issues, including crippling of essential personal protective equipment (PPE) needed for high-risk occupations such as those in healthcare. As a result of these supply chain issues, unprecedented crisis capacity strategies were implemented to divert PPE items such as filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs, namely N95s) to those who needed them most for protection. Large-scale methods for decontamination were used throughout the world to preserve these items and provided for their extended use. The general public also adopted the use of non-specialized protective equipment such as face coverings. So, the need for cleaning, decontamination, or disinfection of these items in addition to normal clothing items became a necessary reality. Some items could be laundered, but other items were not appropriate for washing/drying. To fill research gaps in small-scale, non-commercial cleaning and disinfection, this bench-scale research was conducted using small coupons (swatches) of multiple PPE/barrier protection materials inoculated with virus (non-pathogenic bacteriophages Phi6 and MS2) and tested against a range of decontamination methods including bleach-, alcohol- and quaternary ammonium compound (QAC)-based liquid sprays, as well as low concentration hydrogen peroxide vapor (LCHPV) and bench-scale laundering. In general, non-porous items were easier to disinfect than porous items, and the enveloped virus Phi6 was overall easier to inactivate than MS2. Multiple disinfection methods were shown to be effective in reducing viral loads from PPE coupons, though only laundering and LCHPV were effective for all materials tested that were inoculated with Phi6. Applications of this and follow-on full-scale research are to provide simple effective cleaning/disinfection methods for use during the current and future pandemics.

Title: Magnetic Levitation System Isolates and Purifies Airborne Viruses.
Abstract: Detection of viable viruses in the air is critical in order to determine the level of risk associated with the airborne diffusion of viruses. Different methods have been developed for the isolation, purification, and detection of viable airborne viruses, but they require an extensive processing time and often present limitations including low physical efficiency (i.e., the amount of collected viruses), low biological efficiency (i.e., the number of viable viruses), or a combination of all. To mitigate such limitations, we have employed an efficient technique based on the magnetic levitation (Maglev) technique with a paramagnetic solution and successfully identified distinct variations in levitation and density characteristics among bacteria (<i>Escherichia coli</i>), phages (MS2), and human viruses (SARS-CoV-2 and influenza H1N1). Notably, the Maglev approach enabled a significant enrichment of viable airborne viruses in air samples. Furthermore, the enriched viruses obtained through Maglev exhibited high purity, rendering them suitable for direct utilization in subsequent analyses such as reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or colorimetric assays. The system is portable, easy to use, and cost-efficient and can potentially provide proactive surveillance data for monitoring future outbreaks of airborne infectious diseases and allow for the induction of various preventative and mitigative measures.

Title: Viral inactivation using microwave-enhanced membrane filtration.
Abstract: Pathogenic viruses (e.g., Enteroviruses, Noroviruses, Rotaviruses, and Adenovirus) present in wastewater, even at low concentrations, can cause serious waterborne diseases. Improving water treatment to enhance viral removal is of paramount significance, especially given the COVID-19 pandemic. This study incorporated microwave-enabled catalysis into membrane filtration and evaluated viral removal using a model bacteriophage (MS2) as a surrogate. Microwave irradiation effectively penetrated the PTFE membrane module and enabled surface oxidation reactions on the membrane-coated catalysts (i.e., BiFeO<sub>3</sub>), which thus elicited strong germicidal effects via local heating and radical formation as reported previously. A log removal of 2.6 was achieved for MS2 within a contact time as low as 20 s using 125-W microwave irradiation with the initial MS2 concentration of 10<sup>5</sup> PFU∙mL<sup>-1</sup>. By contrast, almost no inactivation could be achieved without microwave irradiation. COMSOL simulation indicates that the catalyst surface could be heated up to 305 <sup>o</sup>C with 125-W microwave irradiation for 20 s and also analyzed microwave penetration into catalyst or water film layers. This research provides new insights to the antiviral mechanisms of this microwave-enabled catalytic membrane filtration.

Title: Efficient deactivation of aerosolized pathogens using a dielectric barrier discharge based cold-plasma detergent in environment device for good indoor air quality.
Abstract: Air pollution is one of the top 5 risks causing chronic diseases according to WHO and airborne transmitted pathogens infection is a huge challenge in the current era. Long living pathogens and small size aerosols are not effectively dealt with by the available indoor air purifiers. In this work, a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) based portable cold-plasma detergent in environment device is reported and its disinfection efficiency has been analyzed in the indoor environment of sizes up to 3 × 2.4 × 2.4 m<sup>3</sup>. The deactivation efficiency of total microbial counts (TMCs) and total fungal counts (TFCs) is found to be more than 99% in 90 min of continuous operation of the device at the optimized parameters. The complete inactivation of MS2 phage and Escherichia coli bacteria with more than 5 log reduction (99.999%) has also been achieved in 30 min and 90 min of operation of the device in an enclosed environment. The device is able to produce negative ions predominantly dominated by natural plasma detergent along with positive ions in the environment similar to mother nature. The device comprises a coaxial DBD geometry plasma source with a specially designed wire mesh electrode of mild steel with a thickness of 1 mm. The need for feed gas, pellets and/or differential pressure has been eliminated from the DBD discharge source for efficient air purification. The existence of negative ions for more than 25 s on average is the key advantage, which can also deactivate long living pathogens and small size aerosols.

Title: The presence of RNA cargo is suspected to modify the surface hydrophobicity of the MS2 phage.
Abstract: The surface hydrophobicity of native or engineered non-enveloped viruses and virus-like particles (VLPs) is a key parameter regulating their fate in living and artificial aqueous systems. Its modulation is mainly depending on the structure and environment of particles. Nevertheless, unexplained variations have been reported between structurally similar viruses and with pH. This indicates that some modulating factors of their hydrophobicity remain to be identified. Herein we investigate the potential involvement of RNA cargo in the MS2 phage used as non-enveloped RNA virus model, by examining the SDS-induced electrophoretic mobility shift (SEMS) determined for native MS2 virions and corresponding RNA-free VLPs at various pH. Interestingly, the SEMS of VLPs was larger and more variable from pH 5 to 9 compared to native virions. These observations are discussed in term of RNA-dependent changes in surface hydrophobicity, suggesting that RNA cargo may be a major modulator/regulator of this viral parameter.

Title: Mutation rate, selection, and epistasis inferred from RNA virus haplotypes via neural posterior estimation.
Abstract: RNA viruses are particularly notorious for their high levels of genetic diversity, which is generated through the forces of mutation and natural selection. However, disentangling these two forces is a considerable challenge, and this may lead to widely divergent estimates of viral mutation rates, as well as difficulties in inferring the fitness effects of mutations. Here, we develop, test, and apply an approach aimed at inferring the mutation rate and key parameters that govern natural selection, from haplotype sequences covering full-length genomes of an evolving virus population. Our approach employs <i>neural posterior estimation</i>, a computational technique that applies simulation-based inference with neural networks to jointly infer multiple model parameters. We first tested our approach on synthetic data simulated using different mutation rates and selection parameters while accounting for sequencing errors. Reassuringly, the inferred parameter estimates were accurate and unbiased. We then applied our approach to haplotype sequencing data from a serial passaging experiment with the MS2 bacteriophage, a virus that parasites <i>Escherichia coli</i>. We estimated that the mutation rate of this phage is around 0.2 mutations per genome per replication cycle (95% highest density interval: 0.051-0.56). We validated this finding with two different approaches based on single-locus models that gave similar estimates but with much broader posterior distributions. Furthermore, we found evidence for reciprocal sign epistasis between four strongly beneficial mutations that all reside in an RNA stem loop that controls the expression of the viral lysis protein, responsible for lysing host cells and viral egress. We surmise that there is a fine balance between over- and underexpression of lysis that leads to this pattern of epistasis. To recap, we have developed an approach for joint inference of the mutation rate and selection parameters from full haplotype data with sequencing errors and used it to reveal features governing MS2 evolution.

Title: Viral Disinfection of Porous Fomites Utilizing a Bacteriophage Model and Chlorine Dioxide Gas.
Abstract: The pursuit of disinfecting porous materials or fomites to inactivate viral agents has special challenges. To address these challenges, a highly portable chlorine dioxide (ClO<sub>2</sub>) gas generation system was used to ascertain the ability of a gaseous preparation to inactivate a viral agent, the MS2 bacteriophage, when associated with potentially porous fomites of cloth, paper towel, and wood. The MS2 bacteriophage is increasingly used as a model to identify means of inactivating infectious viral agents of significance to humans. Studies showed that MS2 bacteriophage can be applied to and subsequently recovered from potential porous fomites such as cloth, paper towel, and wood. Paired with viral plaque assays, this provided a means for assessing the ability of gaseous ClO<sub>2</sub> to inactivate bacteriophage associated with the porous materials. Notable results include 100% inactivation of 6 log bacteriophage after overnight exposure to 20 parts per million(ppm) ClO<sub>2</sub>. Reducing exposure time to 90 minutes and gas ppm to lower concentrations proved to remain effective in bacteriophage elimination in association with porous materials. Stepwise reduction in gas concentration from 76 ppm to 5 ppm consistently resulted in greater than 99.99% to 100% reduction of recoverable bacteriophage. This model suggests the potential of ClO<sub>2</sub> gas deployment systems for use in the inactivation of viral agents associated with porous potential fomites. The ClO<sub>2</sub> gas could prove especially helpful in disinfecting enclosed areas containing viral contaminated surfaces, rather than manually spraying and wiping them.

Title: Disinfection of Phi6, MS2, and Escherichia coli by Natural Sunlight on Healthcare Critical Surfaces.
Abstract: Ultraviolet (UV) radiation systems, commonly used to disinfect surfaces, drinking water, and air, stem from historical practice to use sunlight to disinfect household items after contagious illness. Currently, it is still recommended in viral outbreak contexts such as COVID-19, Ebola, and Marburg to expose soft surfaces to sunlight after washing with detergent or disinfecting with chlorine. However, sunlight that reaches the Earth's surface is in the UVA/UVB wavelengths, whereas UV disinfection systems typically rely on biocidal UVC. Our goal was to fill the evidence gap on the efficacy of sunlight disinfection on surface materials common in low-resource healthcare settings by seeding four surfaces (stainless steel, nitrile, tarp, cloth) with three microorganisms (viral surrogate bacteriophages Phi6 and MS2 and Escherichia coli bacteria), with and without soil load, and exposing to three sunlight conditions (full sun, partial sun, cloudy). We conducted 144 tests in triplicate and found: solar radiation averaged 737 W/m2 (SD = 333), 519 W/m2 (SD = 65), and 149 W/m2 (SD = 24) for full sun, partial sun, and cloudy conditions; significantly more surfaces averaged ≥ 4 log10 reduction value (LRV) for Phi6 than MS2 and E. coli (P < 0.001) after full sun exposure, and no samples achieved ≥ 4 LRV for partial sun or cloudy conditions. On the basis of our results, we recommend no change to current protocols of disinfecting materials first with a 0.5% chlorine solution then moving to sunlight to dry. Additional field-based research is recommended to understand sunlight disinfection efficacy against pathogenic organisms on healthcare relevant surfaces during actual outbreak contexts.

Title: In-situ fabrication of titanium suboxide-laser induced graphene composites: Removal of organic pollutants and MS2 Bacteriophage.
Abstract: Titanium suboxides (TSO) are identified as a series of compounds showing excellent electro- and photo-chemical properties. TSO composites with carbon-based materials such as graphene have further improved water splitting and pollutant removal performance. However, their expensive and multi-step synthesis limits their wide-scale use. Furthermore, recently discovered laser-induced graphene (LIG) is a single-step and low-cost fabrication of graphene-based composites. Moreover, LIG's highly electrically conductive surface aids in tremendous environmental applications, including bacterial inactivation, anti-biofouling, and pollutant sensing. Here, we demonstrate the single-step in-situ fabrication of TSO-LIG composite by directly scribing the TiO<sub>2</sub> mixed poly(ether) sulfone sheets using a CO<sub>2</sub> infrared laser. In contrast, earlier composites were derived from either commercial-grade TSO or synthesized TSO with graphene in multi step processes. The characteristic Ti<sup>3+</sup> peaks in XPS confirmed the conversion of TiO<sub>2</sub> into its sub-stoichiometric form, enhancing the electro-catalytical properties of the LIG-TiO<sub>x</sub> composite surface. Electrochemical characterization, including impedance spectroscopy, validated the surface's enhanced electrochemical activity and electrode stability. Furthermore, the LIG-TiO<sub>x</sub> composite surfaces were tested for anti-biofouling action and electrochemical application as electrodes and filters. The composite electrodes exhibit enhanced degradation performance for removing emerging pollutant antibiotics ciprofloxacin and methylene blue due to the in-situ hydroxyl radical generation. Additionally, the LIG-TiO<sub>x</sub> conductive filters showed the complete 6-log killing of mixed bacterial culture and MS2 phage virus in flow-through filtration mode at 2.5 V, which is ∼2.5-log more killing compared to non-composited LIG filers at 500 Lm<sup>-2</sup>h<sup>-1</sup>. Nevertheless, these cost-effective LIG-TiO<sub>x</sub> composites have excellent electrical properties and can be effectively utilized for energy and environmental applications.

Title: Effects of surface hydrophobicity on the removal of F-specific RNA phages from reclaimed water by coagulation and ceramic membrane microfiltration.
Abstract: Microfiltration (MF) has been widely adopted as an advanced treatment process to reduce suspended solids and turbidity in treated wastewater effluents designated for potable reuse. Although microfilter pores are much larger than viruses, the addition of a coagulant upstream of a microfilter system can achieve stable virus removal. Ceramic membranes have a narrow pore size distribution to achieve the high removal of contaminants. This study aims to evaluate virus log reduction using bench-scale coagulation and ceramic membrane MF. To investigate the effects of differences in net surface hydrophobicity, 18 sewage-derived F-specific RNA phages (FRNAPHs) were used for batch hydrophobicity and coagulation-MF tests. The capability of bench-scale coagulation and ceramic membrane MF under continuous automated long-term operation was tested to remove the lab reference strain MS2 and three selected FRNAPH isolates which varied by surface property. Median virus log reduction values (LRVs) exceeding 6.2 were obtained for all three isolates and MS2. Although coagulation and hydrophobicity were positively correlated, the virus isolate demonstrating the lowest level of hydrophobicity and coagulation (genogroup I) still exhibited a high LRV. Thus, coagulation and ceramic membrane MF systems may serve as viable options for virus removal during water reclamation and advanced treatment.

Abstract: Cell-free genetically encoded biosensors have been developed to detect small molecules and nucleic acids, but they have yet to be reliably engineered to detect proteins. Here we develop an automated platform to convert protein-binding RNA aptamers into riboswitch sensors that operate within low-cost cell-free assays. We demonstrate the platform by engineering 35 protein-sensing riboswitches for human monomeric C-reactive protein, human interleukin-32γ, and phage MS2 coat protein. The riboswitch sensors regulate output expression levels by up to 16-fold with input protein concentrations within the human serum range. We identify two distinct mechanisms governing riboswitch-mediated regulation of translation rates and leverage computational analysis to refine the protein-binding aptamer regions, improving design accuracy. Overall, we expand the cell-free sensor toolbox and demonstrate how computational design is used to develop protein-sensing riboswitches with future applications as low-cost medical diagnostics.

Title: Identification and Characterization of HEPN-MNT Type II TA System from Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus ΔH.
Abstract: Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are widespread in bacteria and archaea plasmids and genomes to regulate DNA replication, gene transcription, or protein translation. Higher eukaryotic and prokaryotic nucleotide-binding (HEPN) and minimal nucleotidyltransferase (MNT) domains are prevalent in prokaryotic genomes and constitute TA pairs. However, three gene pairs (MTH304/305, 408/409, and 463/464) of Methanothermobacter thermautotropicus ΔH HEPN-MNT family have not been studied as TA systems. Among these candidates, our study characterizes the MTH463/MTH464 TA system. MTH463 expression inhibited Escherichia coli growth, whereas MTH464 did not and blocked MTH463 instead. Using site-directed MTH463 mutagenesis, we determined that amino acids R99G, H104A, and Y106A from the R[ɸX]4-6H motif are involved with MTH463 cell toxicity. Furthermore, we established that purified MTH463 could degrade MS2 phage RNA, whereas purified MTH464 neutralized MTH463 activity in vitro. Our results indicate that the endonuclease toxin MTH463 (encoding a HEPN domain) and its cognate antitoxin MTH464 (encoding the MNT domain) may act as a type II TA system in M. thermautotropicus ΔH. This study provides initial and essential information studying TA system functions, primarily archaea HEPN-MNT family.

Title: Superiority of UV222 radiation by in situ aquatic electrode KrCl excimer in disinfecting waterborne pathogens: Mechanism and efficacy.
Abstract: Microbial safety in water has always been the focus of attention, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Development of green, efficient and safe disinfection technology is the key to control the spread of pathogenic microorganisms. Here, an in situ aquatic electrode KrCl excimer radiation with main emission wavelength 222 nm (UV222) was designed and used to disinfect model waterborne virus and bacteria, i.e. phage MS2, E. coli and S. aureus. High inactivation efficacy and diversity of inactivation mechanisms of UV222 were proved by comparision with those of commercial UV254. UV222 could totally inactivate MS2, E. coli and S. aureus with initial concentrations of ∼10<sup>7</sup> PFU or CFU mL<sup>-1</sup> within 20, 15, and 36 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively. The UV dose required by UV254 to inactivate the same logarithmic pathogenic microorganism is at least twice that of UV222. The protein, genomic and cell membrane irreparable damage contributed to the microbial inactivation by UV222, but UV254 only act on nucleic acid of the target microorganisms. We found that UV222 damage nucleic acid with almost the same or even higher efficacy with UV254. In addition, free base damage of UV222 in similar ways with UV254(dimer and hydrate). But due to the quantum yield of free base degradation of UV222 was greater than UV254, the photolysis rates of UV222 to A, G, C and U four bases were 11.5, 1.2, 3.2 and 1 times as those of UV254, respectively. Excellent disinfection performance in UV222 irradiation was also achieved in real water matrices (WWTP and Lake).

Title: Estimation of Bacteriophage MS2 Inactivation Parameters During Microwave Heating of Frozen Strawberries.
Abstract: Frozen berries have been repeatedly linked to acute gastroenteritis caused by norovirus, the most common cause of foodborne illness in the United States. Many guidelines recommend that frozen berries be microwaved for at least 2 min, but it is unclear if this thermal treatment is effective at inactivating norovirus. The objective of this study was to model the effect of microwave heating at varying power levels on the survival of bacteriophage MS2, a norovirus surrogate, when inoculated onto frozen strawberries. Bacteriophage MS2 was inoculated onto the surface of frozen strawberries with a starting concentration of approximately 10 log PFU/g. Samples (either 3 or 5 whole strawberries) were heated in a 1300-Watt domestic research microwave oven (frequency of 2450 MHz) at power levels of 30, 50, 70, and 100% (full power), for times ranging from 15 to 300 s to determine inactivation. Temperatures at berry surfaces were monitored during heating using fiberoptic thermometry. All experiments were conducted in triplicate. The primary model for thermal inactivation was a log-linear model of logN vs. time. The secondary model was for a D-value decreasing linearly with temperature and an added term that was path-dependent on the thermal history. Parameters in the model were estimated using dynamic temperature history at the surface of the berry, via nonlinear regression using all data simultaneously. The root mean square error was ∼0.5 PFU/g out of a total 6-log reduction. Log reductions of 1.1 ± 0.4, 1.5 ± 0.5, 3.1 ± 0.1, and 3.8 ± 0.2 log PFU/g were observed for 30, 50, 70, and 100% microwave power levels when three berries were heated for 60 s. D-values were 21.4 ± 1.95 s and 10.6 ± 1.1 s at 10 and 60°C, respectively. This work demonstrates an approach to estimate inactivation parameters for viruses from dynamic temperature data during microwave heating. These findings will be useful in predicting the safety effect of microwave heating of berries in the home or food service.

Title: How to Tackle Bacteriophages: The Review of Approaches with Mechanistic Insight.
Abstract: Bacteriophage-based applications have a renaissance today, increasingly marking their use in industry, medicine, food processing, biotechnology, and more. However, phages are considered resistant to various harsh environmental conditions; besides, they are characterized by high intra-group variability. Phage-related contaminations may therefore pose new challenges in the future due to the wider use of phages in industry and health care. Therefore, in this review, we summarize the current knowledge of bacteriophage disinfection methods, as well as highlight new technologies and approaches. We discuss the need for systematic solutions to improve bacteriophage control, taking into account their structural and environmental diversity.

Title: Viral Preservation with Protein-Supplemented Nebulizing Media in Aerosols.
Abstract: The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has emphasized the need for a deeper understanding of infectivity, spread, and treatment of airborne viruses. Bacteriophages (phages) serve as ideal surrogates for respiratory pathogenic viruses thanks to their high tractability and the structural similarities tailless phages bear to viral pathogens. However, the aerosolization of enveloped SARS-CoV-2 surrogate phi6 usually results in a >3-log<sub>10</sub> reduction in viability, limiting its usefulness as a surrogate for aerosolized coronavirus in "real world" contexts, such as a sneeze or cough. Recent work has shown that saliva or artificial saliva greatly improves the stability of viruses in aerosols and microdroplets relative to standard dilution/storage buffers like suspension medium (SM) buffer. These findings led us to investigate whether we could formulate media that preserves the viability of phi6 and other phages in artificially derived aerosols. Results indicate that SM buffer supplemented with bovine serum albumin (BSA) significantly improves the recovery of airborne phi6, MS2, and 80α and outperforms commercially formulated artificial saliva. Particle sizing and acoustic particle trapping data indicate that BSA supplementation dose-dependently improves viral survivability by reducing the extent of particle evaporation. These data suggest that our viral preservation medium may facilitate a lower-cost alternative to artificial saliva for future applied aerobiology studies. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> We have identified common and inexpensive lab reagents that confer increased aerosol survivability on phi6 and other phages. Our results suggest that soluble protein is a key protective component in nebulizing medium. Protein supplementation likely reduces exposure of the phage to the air-water interface by reducing the extent of particle evaporation. These findings will be useful for applications in which researchers wish to improve the survivability of these (and likely other) aerosolized viruses to better approximate highly transmissible airborne viruses like SARS-CoV-2.

Title: Efficacy of Grignard Pure to Inactivate Airborne Phage MS2, a Common SARS-CoV-2 Surrogate.
Abstract: Grignard Pure (GP) is a unique and proprietary blend of triethylene glycol (TEG) and inert ingredients designed for continuous antimicrobial treatment of air. TEG has been designated as a ″Safer Chemical" by the US EPA. GP has already received approval from the US EPA under its Section 18 Public Health Emergency Exemption program for use in seven states. This study characterizes the efficacy of GP for inactivating MS2 bacteriophage─a nonenveloped virus widely used as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2. Experiments measured the decrease in airborne viable MS2 concentration in the presence of different concentrations of GP from 60 to 90 min, accounting for both natural die-off and settling of MS2. Experiments were conducted both by introducing GP aerosol into air containing MS2 and by introducing airborne MS2 into air containing GP aerosol. GP is consistently able to rapidly reduce viable MS2 bacteriophage concentration by 2-3 logs at GP concentrations of 0.04-0.5 mg/m<sup>3</sup> (corresponding to TEG concentrations of 0.025 to 0.287 mg/m<sup>3</sup>). Related GP efficacy experiments by the US EPA, as well as GP (TEG) safety and toxicology, are also discussed.

Title: Virus Emissions from Toilet Flushing: Comparing Urine-Diverting to Mix Flush Toilets.
Abstract: High levels of viruses can be found in human excrement from infected individuals, a fraction of which can be emitted from toilet flushing. Unlike the common mix flush toilet (MFT), the urine-diverting toilet (UDT) separates urine from the toilet water. Specific focus on urine-associated viruses is needed because the UDT can emit different levels of urine-associated and fecal-borne viruses and urine has different properties compared to feces that can affect emission levels (e.g., protein content). In this work, we quantified emission levels of surrogate bacteriophages for urine-associated and fecal-borne viruses, MS2 and T3, from flushing a UDT and an MFT, with and without protein in the water. Emission levels of viruses in the water of the UDT were lower than that of the MFT by up to 1.2-log<sub>10</sub> and 1.3-log<sub>10</sub> for T3 and MS2, respectively. If urine is completely diverted in the UDT, virus emissions can be reduced by up to 4-log<sub>10</sub>. Based on these results and typical levels in urine and feces, we estimate that up to 10<sup>7</sup> and 10<sup>8</sup> gene copies of human viruses per flush can be released from the UDT and MFT, respectively. Lower emissions observed with the UDT suggest reduced exposure to viruses from flushing the UDT.

Title: Heteroaggregation of virions and microplastics reduces the number of active bacteriophages in aqueous environments.
Abstract: The objective of this study is to explore the effects of microplastics on the viability of the bacteriophages in an aqueous environment. Bacteriophages (phages), that is, viruses of bacteria, are essential in homeostasis. It is estimated that phages cause up to 40% of the death of all bacteria daily. Any factor affecting phage activity is vital for the whole food chain and the ecology of numerous niches. We hypothesize that the number of active phages decreases due to the virions' adsorption on microplastic particles or by the released leachables from additives used in the production of plastic, for example, stabilizers, plasticizers, colorants, and reinforcements. We exposed three diverse phages, namely, T4 (tailed), MS2 (icosahedral), and M13 (filamentous), to 1 mg/mL suspension of 12 industrial-grade plastics [acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, high-impact polystyrene, poly-ε-caproamide, polycarbonate, polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, poly(methyl methacrylate), polypropylene, polystyrene, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyurethane, and polyvinyl chloride] shredded to obtain microparticles of radius ranging from 2 to 50 μm. The effect of leachables was measured upon exposure of phages not to particles themselves but to the buffer preincubated with microplastics. A double-overlay plaque counting method was used to assess phage titers. We employed a classical linear regression model to verify which physicochemical parameters (65 variables were tested) govern the decrease of phage titers. The key finding is that adsorption mechanisms result in up to complete scavenging of virions, whereas leachables deactivate up to 50% of phages. This study reveals microplastic pollution's plausible and unforeseen ecotoxicological effect causing phage deactivation. Moreover, phage transmission through adsorption can alter the balance of the food chain in the new environment. The effect depends mainly on the zeta potentials of the polymers and the phage type.

Title: MiR146a-loaded engineered exosomes released from silk fibroin patch promote diabetic wound healing by targeting IRAK1.
Abstract: Unhealable diabetic wounds need to be addressed with the help of newer, more efficacious strategies. Exosomes combined with biomaterials for sustained delivery of therapeutic agents are expected to bring new hope for chronic wound treatment. Here, the engineered exosomes modified for efficiently loading miR146a and attaching to silk fibroin patch (SFP) were demonstrated to promote diabetic wound healing. Silk fibroin binding peptide (SFBP) was screened through phage display, and SFBP-Gluc-MS2 (SGM) and pac-miR146a-pac fusion protein were constructed. The designed exosomes (SGM-Exos, miR146a-Exos, and SGM-miR146a-Exos) were isolated from the engineered placental mesenchymal stem cells (PMSCs) transduced with SGM or/and pac-miR146a-pac protein. Gluc signals indicated SGM-Exo@SFP markedly increased the binding rate and the stability of SGM-Exo. Moreover, the loading efficiency of miR146a in SGM-miR146a-Exos was ten-fold higher than that in miR146a-Exos. Superior to untreated, SGM-miR146a-Exo-only treated, and SFP-only treated groups, SGM-miR146a-Exo@SFP drived wound healing associated with less inflammation, collagen deposition, and neovascularization. The transcriptomics analysis suggested anti-inflammatory and regenerative effects with SGM-miR146a-Exo@SFP treatment. Here, we show efficient exosome@biomaterial-based miRNA delivery systems for regenerative medicine and tissue engineering.

Title: Bacterial RNA virus MS2 exposure increases the expression of cancer progression genes in the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line.
Abstract: Bacteriophages effectively counteract diverse bacterial infections, and their ability to treat most types of cancer has been explored using phage engineering or phage-virus hybrid platforms. In the present study, it was demonstrated that the bacteriophage MS2 can affect the expression of genes associated with the proliferation and survival of LNCaP prostate epithelial cells. LNCaP cells were exposed to bacteriophage MS2 at a concentration of 1×10<sup>7</sup> plaque forming units/ml for 24-48 h. After exposure, various cellular parameters, including cell viability, morphology, and changes in gene expression, were examined. MS2 affected cell viability adversely, reducing viability by 25% in the first 4 h of treatment; however, cell viability recovered within 24-48 h. Similarly, the <i>AKT</i>, androgen receptor, integrin α5, integrin β1, <i>MAPK1, MAPK3, STAT3</i>, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α genes, which are involved in various normal cellular processes and tumor progression, were significantly upregulated, whereas the expression levels of <i>HSP90, ITGB5, ITGB3, HSP27, ITGAV</i>, and <i>PI3K</i> genes were unchanged. Therefore, based on viability and gene expression changes, bacteriophage MS2 severely impaired LNCaP cells by reducing anchorage-dependent survival and androgen signaling. A caveolin-mediated endocytosis mechanism for MS2-mediated signaling in prostate cancer cells was proposed based on reports involving bacteriophages T4, M13, and MS2, and their interactions with LNCaP and PC3 cell lines.

Title: Antimicrobial and Virucidal Potential of Morpholinium-Based Ionic Liquids.
Abstract: Witnessed by the ongoing spread of antimicrobial resistant bacteria as well as the recent global pandemic of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the development of new disinfection strategies is of great importance, and novel substance classes as effective antimicrobials and virucides are urgently needed. Ionic liquids (ILs), low-melting salts, have been already recognized as efficient antimicrobial agents with prospects for antiviral potential. In this study, we examined the antiviral activity of 12 morpholinium based herbicidal ionic liquids with a tripartite test system, including enzyme inhibition tests, virucidal activity determination against five model viruses and activity against five bacterial species. The antimicrobial and enzymatic tests confirmed that the inhibiting activity of ILs corresponds with the number of long alkyl side chains and that [Dec<sub>2</sub>Mor]<sup>+</sup> based ILs are promising candidates as novel antimicrobials. The virucidal tests showed that ILs antiviral activity depends on the type and structure of the virus, revealing enveloped Phi6 phage as highly susceptible to the ILs action, while the non-enveloped phages PRD1 and MS2 proved completely resistant to ionic liquids. Furthermore, a comparison of results obtained for P100 and P001 phages demonstrated for the first time that the susceptibility of viruses to ionic liquids can be dependent on differences in the phage tail structure.

Title: CRISPR/Cas12a-Assisted Dual Visualized Detection of SARS-CoV-2 on Frozen Shrimps.
Abstract: Given the possibility that food contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 might become an infection source, there is an urgent need for us to develop a rapid and accurate nucleic acid detection method for SARS-CoV-2 in food to ensure food safety. Here, we propose a sensitive, specific, and reliable molecular detection method for SARS-CoV-2. It has a mechanism to control amplicon contamination. Swabs from spiked frozen shrimps were used as detection samples, which were processed by heating at 95 °C for 30 s. These preprocessed samples served as the templates for subsequent amplification. A colorimetric LAMP reaction was carried out to amplify both the SARS-CoV-2 target and the MS2 phage simultaneously in one tube. MS2 phage was detected by colorimetric LAMP as the internal control, while SARS-CoV-2 was detected with a CRISPR/Cas12a system. The fluorescence results could be visually detected with an ultraviolet lamp. Meanwhile, uracil was incorporated during the LAMP reaction to provide an amplicon contamination proof mechanism. This test could detect as low as 20 copies of SARS-CoV-2 in one reaction. Additionally, the detection could be finished in 45 min. The test only needs a heating block and an ultraviolet lamp, which shows the potential for field detection.

Title: Grating-like DBD plasma for air disinfection: Dose and dose-response characteristics.
Abstract: Atmospheric pressure dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma is an emerging technique for effective bioaerosol decontamination and is promising to be used in indoor environments to reduce infections. However, fundamental knowledge of the dose and dose-response characteristics of plasma-based disinfection technology is very limited. By examining the single-pass removal efficiency of S. lentus aerosol by in-duct grating-like DBD plasma reactors with varied discharge setups (gap distance, electrode size, number of discharge layers, frequency, dielectric material), it was found that the specific input energy (SIE) could be served as the dose for disinfection, and the efficiency was exponentially dependent on SIE in most cases. The corresponding susceptibility constants (Z values) were obtained hereinafter. Humidity was a prominent factor boosting the efficiency with a Z value of 0.36 L/J at relative humidity (RH) of 20% and 1.68 L/J at RH of 60%. MS2 phage showed a much higher efficiency of 2.66-3.08 log<sub>10</sub> of reduction than those of S. lentus (38-85%) and E. coli (42%-95%) under the same condition. Using SIE as the dose, the performance of plasma reactors in the literature was compared and evaluated.

Title: Simple Low-Cost Production of DNA MS2 Virus-Like Particles As Molecular Diagnostic Controls.
Abstract: Suitable controls are integral for the validation and continued quality assurance of diagnostic workflows. Plasmids, DNA, or <i>in vitro</i> transcribed RNA are often used to validate novel diagnostic workflows, however, they are poorly representative of clinical samples. RNA phage virus-like particles (VLPs) packaged with exogenous RNA have been used in clinical diagnostics as workflow controls, serving as surrogates for infectious viral particles. Comparable controls for DNA viruses are more challenging to produce, with analogous DNA phages being infectious and packaging of DNA within RNA phages requiring complex purification procedures and expensive chemical linkers. We present a simple and inexpensive method to produce <i>Emesvirus zinderi</i> (MS2) VLPs, packaged with DNA, that makes use of affinity chromatography for purification and enzymatic production of exogenous DNA suitable for packaging. The produced VLPs were packaged with hepatitis B virus DNA and were then quantified using droplet digital PCR and calibrated against the WHO international standard using a commercial assay in an accredited clinical laboratory.

Title: An actinometric method to characterize performance of reflecting UVC reactors used for water treatment.
Abstract: The applicability of chemical actinometry to characterize the fluence in UV reactors with reflections, non-parallel light, and variable water transmittance is limited due to the unknown effective path length or hydraulic shortcuts within the reactor. In this study, the effects of reflection and transmittance on actinometry were examined and a new, optimized and easy method for determining fluence was developed. KI/KIO<sub>3</sub> and uridine actinometry experiments were carried out under controlled conditions using a collimated beam apparatus and a completely mixed batch reactor with or without diffuse reflection and compared to biodosimetry results. Whereas optically opaque actinometers such as KI/KIO<sub>3</sub> are not directly capable of predicting the fluence of reflecting reactors, the results of uridine actinometry are influenced by reflection and transmission. To precisely predict the fluence rate in UV reactors with uridine, knowledge about the effective optical path length of the light is needed. Here, an existing method to mathematically calculate the optical path length was adopted and optimized for uridine actinometry. Results for average fluence were validated by biodosimetry using MS2 phages under different degrees of reflection and transmission. It could be shown that by modifying the bottom of the reactor with diffusely reflecting polytetrafluoroethylene foil, the fluence rate was increased by a factor of approximately 2.6 and the path length by factor of 2.4. When only half of the bottom was covered with reflective foil, fluence rate increased by a factor of 1.8 and path length by 1.8. Although this new approach cannot replace biodosimetry, to predict the fluence distribution received by microorganisms, it can provide means to characterize more complex reactor designs, validate results of advanced reactor modeling, and quantify fluence for non-parallel irradiation and reflective light, especially for the application of high fluence (e.g., advanced oxidation processes), where biodosimetry may be too sensitive. Further, comparing the fluence obtained with actinometry to the results of biodosimetry might qualitatively indicate hydraulic short cuts or unideal fluence distributions for flow-through reactors.

Title: Virus inactivation by sequential ultraviolet-chlorine disinfection: Synergistic effect and mechanism.
Abstract: The COVID-19 outbreak has raised concerns about the efficacy of the disinfection process followed in water treatment plants in preventing the spread of viruses. Ultraviolet (UV) and chlorine multi-barrier disinfection processes are commonly used in water treatment plants; however, their effects on virus inactivation are still unclear. In this study, the effects of different disinfection processes (i.e., UV, free chlorine, and their combination) on waterborne viruses were analyzed using bacteriophage surrogates (i.e., MS2 and PR772) as alternative indicators. The results showed that the inactivation rates of PR772 by either UV or free chlorine disinfection were higher than those of MS2. PR772 was approximately 1.5 times more sensitive to UV disinfection and 8.4 times more sensitive to chlorine disinfection than MS2. Sequential UV-chlorine disinfection had a synergistic effect on virus inactivation, which was enhanced by an increase in the UV dose. As compared with single free chlorine disinfection, UV irradiation at 40 mJ cm<sup>-2</sup> enhanced MS2 and PR772 inactivation significantly with a 2.7-fold (MS2) and a 1.7-fold (PR772) increase in the inactivation rate constants on subsequent chlorination in phosphate buffered saline. The synergistic effect was also observed in real wastewater samples, in which the MS2 inactivation rate increased 1.4-fold on subsequent chlorination following UV irradiation at 40 mJ cm<sup>-2</sup>. The mechanism of the synergistic effect of sequential UV-chlorine disinfection was determined via sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, using MS2 as an indicator. The results showed that the synergistic effect was due to damage to MS2 surface proteins caused by previous UV disinfection, which enhanced the sensitivity of MS2 to chlorination. This study provides a feasible approach for the efficient inactivation of viruses in water supply and drainage.

Title: Surrogate Selection for Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus in Disinfectant Efficacy Tests by Simultaneous Comparison of Bacteriophage MS2 and Bovine Enterovirus Type 1.
Abstract: In South Korea, testing disinfectants against foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) that are contagious in livestock or that require special attention with respect to public hygiene can be manipulated only in high-level containment laboratories, which are not easily available. This causes difficulties in the approval procedure for disinfectants, such as a prolonged testing period. Additionally, the required biosafety level (BSL) in the case of FMDV has hindered its extensive studies. However, this drawback can be circumvented by using a surrogate virus to improve the performance of the efficacy testing procedure for disinfectants. Therefore, we studied bacteriophage MS2 (MS2) and bovine enterovirus type 1 (ECBO) with respect to disinfectant susceptibility for selecting a surrogate for FMDV according to the Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency (APQA) guidelines for efficacy testing of veterinary disinfectants. Effective concentrations of the active substances in disinfectants (potassium peroxymonosulfate, sodium dichloroisocyanurate, malic acid, citric acid, glutaraldehyde, and benzalkonium chloride) against FMDV, MS2, and ECBO were compared and, efficacies of eight APQA-listed commercial disinfectants used against FMDV were examined. The infectivity of FMDV and ECBO were confirmed by examination of cytopathic effects, and MS2 by plaque assay. The results reveal that the disinfectants are effective against MS2 and ECBO at higher concentrations than in FMDV, confirming their applicability as potential surrogates for FMDV in efficacy testing of veterinary disinfectants.

With the aim of developing biobased virucidal/virus capture agents, we report a chemical modification of the cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) surface with poly(2-dimethylamino) ethyl acrylate) methyl chloride quaternary salt (Q-PDMAEA) to introduce the positively charged functional groups. The surface of CNCs was modified through direct and indirect graft polymerization. Subsequently, the direct and indirect cationization effect on the degree of functionalization, thermal stability, crystallinity, and antiviral activity of CNCs was investigated. Indirect cationization produced the highest degree of polymer grafting, increasing particle size and thermal stability. Further, the modified CNCs were tested for their ability to capture nonenveloped bacteriophages PhiX174 (ΦX174) and MS2. We observed a significant (>4.19 log<sub>10</sub>) reduction in total viral load by specific functionalized CNCs. However, the activity depended on the structure of functional groups, surface charge density, and the type of virus under study. Overall, the direct and indirect cationization of CNC leads to biobased agents with immobilized cationic charge, with good virus capture activity. Such agents can be used for various applications including textiles, packaging, wastewater treatment, etc.

Title: Evaluation of pathogen disinfection efficiency of electrochemical advanced oxidation to become a sustainable technology for water reuse.
Abstract: Water treatment and reuse is gaining acceptance as a strategy to fight against water contamination and scarcity, but it usually requires complex treatments to ensure safety. Consequently, the electrochemical advanced processes have emerged as an effective alternative for water remediation. The main objective here is to perform a systematic study that quantifies the efficiency of a laboratory-scale electrochemical system to inactivate bacteria, bacterial spores, protozoa, bacteriophages and viruses in synthetic water, as well as in urban wastewater once treated in a wetland for reuse in irrigation. A Ti|RuO<sub>2</sub>-based plate and Si|BDD thin-film were comparatively employed as the anode, which was combined with a stainless-steel cathode in an undivided cell operating at 12 V. Despite the low resulting current density (<15 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>), both anodes demonstrated the production of oxidants in wetland effluent water. The disinfection efficiency was high for the bacteriophage MS2 (T99 in less than 7.1 min) and bacteria (T99 in about 30 min as maximum), but limited for CBV5 and TuV, spores and amoebas (T99 in more than 300 min). MS2 presented a rapid exponential inactivation regardless of the anode and bacteria showed similar sigmoidal curves, whereas human viruses, spores and amoebas resulted in linear profiles. Due the different sensitivity of microorganisms, different models must be considered to predict their inactivation kinetics. On this basis, it can be concluded that evaluating the viral inactivation from inactivation profiles determined for bacteria or some bacteriophages may be misleading. Therefore, neither bacteria nor bacteriophages are suitable models for the disinfection of water containing enteric viruses. The electrochemical treatment added as a final disinfection step enhances the inactivation of microorganisms, which could contribute to safe water reuse for irrigation. Considering the calculated low energy consumption, decentralized water treatment units powered by photovoltaic modules might be a near reality.

Title: Antiviral activity of nano-monocaprin against Phi6 as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2.
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic involving SARS-CoV-2 has raised interest in using antimicrobial lipid formulations to inhibit viral entry into their host cells or to inactivate them. Lipids are a part of the innate defense mechanism against pathogens. Here, we evaluated the use of nano-monocaprin (NMC) in inhibiting enveloped (phi6) and unenveloped (MS2) bacteriophages. NMC was prepared using the sonochemistry technique. Size and morphology analysis revealed the formation of ~ 8.4 ± 0.2-nm NMC as measured by dynamic light scattering. We compared the antiviral activity of NMC with molecular monocaprin (MMC) at 0.5 mM and 2 mM concentrations against phi6, which we used as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2. The synthesized NMC exhibited 50% higher antiviral activity against phi6 than MMC at pH 7 using plaque assay. NMC inactivated phi6 stronger at pH 4 than at pH 7. To determine if NMC is toxic to mammalian cells, we used MTS assay to assess its IC<sub>50</sub> for HPDE and HeLa cell lines, which were ~ 203 and 221 µM, respectively. NMC may be used for prophylactic application either as a drop or spray since many viruses enter the human body through the mucosal lining of the nose, eyes, and lungs.

Title: Plasma-generated reactive water mist for disinfection of N95 respirators laden with MS2 and T4 bacteriophage viruses.
Abstract: Due to the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 pandemic, the interest and demand for sterilization devices to reuse PPE has increased. For reuse of face masks, they must be effectively decontaminated of potential infectious agents without compromising its filtration ability during sterilization. In this study, we utilized an atmospheric pressure pulsed dielectric barrier discharge (DBD), combined with nebulized liquid microdroplets to generate plasma-activated mist (PAM). MS2 and T4 bacteriophages were used to conduct the decontamination tests on two types of N95 respirators. Results showed at least a 2-log reduction of MS2 and T4 on N95 respirators treated in one cycle with 7.8% hydrogen peroxide PAM and at least a 3-log reduction treated in 10% hydrogen peroxide PAM. In addition, it was found that there was no significant degradation in filtration efficiency of N95 respirators (3M 1860 and 1804) treated in 10% hydrogen peroxide PAM found after 20 cycles. In terms of re-useability of masks after treatment as determined, it was shown that the elastic straps of 3M 1804 were fragmented after 20 treatment cycles rendering them unusable, while the straps of 3M 1860 were not negatively affected even after 20 disinfection cycles.

Title: Evaluation of disinfection efficacy of single UV-C, and UV-A followed by UV-C LED irradiation on Escherichia coli, B. spizizenii and MS2 bacteriophage, in water.
Abstract: Ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (UV LEDs) have shown ability to inactivate microorganisms and viruses in water. The unique characteristic of the UV-LEDs' diversity in wavelengths ranging from UV-C, UV-B, and UV-A, allows for wavelengths to be combined in different manners for polychromatic irradiation. Previous studies reported no synergy from simultaneous or sequential UV-C and UV-B as well as UV-C or UV-B followed by UV-A irradiation. However, synergy was reported for UV-A followed by UV-C or UV-B irradiation on various microorganisms. Nevertheless, no clear ground has been reached on whether to adopt single UV-C wavelengths or UV-A followed by UV-C LED, irradiation on inactivation of microorganisms and viruses in water. Therefore, this work evaluates the disinfection efficacy of single UV-C as well as UV-A followed by UV-C LED irradiation on Escherichia coli, Bacillus spizizenii spores and MS2 bacteriophage in water. The UV-C wavelengths were represented by 267 and 278 nm UV LEDs, and UV-A by 368 nm UV LEDs. In this study, E. coli was highly susceptible to UV radiation followed by B. spizizenii spores, and lastly MS2. Repair following UV inactivation was only observed in E. coli. The synergistic effect found in both E. coli, and B. spizizenii spores was attributed to the different inactivation mechanisms of the UV-C and UV-A wavelengths. In both single UV-C, and UV-A followed by UV-C LED irradiations, single 267 nm UV-C LED showed higher inactivation efficacy. Meanwhile, single 278 nm UV-C LED showed higher efficacy in terms of suppression of repair, and electrical energy consumption. Using single UV-C LEDs in a water disinfection system cuts down on related extra costs by avoiding combined wavelengths while still attaining better levels of microorganism inactivation, repair suppression and electrical energy consumption. These findings are applicable for the design and implementation of UV LED water disinfection systems.

Title: High Level Bioaerosol Protection against Infective Aerosols: How Medical Face Masks Compare against Respirators.
Abstract: Face masks and respirators are commonly used to prevent the transmission of infectious diseases that spread by respiratory droplets and aerosols. However, there is still uncertainty about the protective effect of the different types of masks against virus containing aerosols. To determine the as-worn bioaerosol protection efficacy of different face coverings and estimate the possible protective function against airborne diseases, we challenged different respirators and medical masks on a standardized dummy head with a bioaerosol containing MS2 bacteriophages as virus surrogates. In our experiments, FFP2 respirators showed the highest filtration efficacy 94 ± 4 (SD) % followed by medical masks 93 ± 3 (SD) % and KN95 respirators 90 ± 7 (SD) %. Nevertheless, we found no statistically significant difference between respirators and medical masks in terms of provided protection against infective aerosols. Our findings indicate that both respirators and medical masks provide a high as-worn bioaerosol protection efficacy against virus containing aerosols, and therefore, a very high protection against airborne diseases. Considering the higher comfort, better availability, and lower price of medical masks in contrast to respirators, it is recommendable to use medical face masks especially in low risk situations and in general public.

Title: Bacteriophages pass through candle-shaped porous ceramic filters: Application for the collection of viruses in soil water.
Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of viruses in soils, their diversity in soil water has not been explored, mainly due to the difficulty of collecting them. In hydrology, soil water is usually collected using porous candles. This study proposes using these porous candles as a new tool for sampling viruses in soil water to analyze their passage through the ceramic part of the candles. The recovery of the viruses was determined after filtration under laboratory conditions using three model bacteriophages (MS2, ΦX174, and Φ6) and Escherichia coli, at neutral and acidic pH. Then, a field experiment was carried out where soil water filtration and viral identification by metagenomic shotgun were performed. At neutral pH, all bacteriophages tested successfully passed through the porous candles during the filtration process, with reductions of 0.02 log, 0.16 log, and 0.55 log for MS2 ΦX174 and Φ6, respectively. At pH 4.4, the passage of MS2 was not affected while ΦX174 underwent a slight reduction in recovery, probably caused by adsorption onto the filter material. Regarding the application of the porous candles in the field, the results obtained allowed the successful recovery of viruses, exposing porous candles as a new method suitable for the collection of viruses from soil water in the context of the study of viral communities.

Title: Bioaccumulation Dynamic by Crassostrea gigas Oysters of Viruses That Are Proposed as Surrogates for Enteric Virus Contamination in Environmental Samples.
Abstract: Oysters are filter-feeders and retain sewage-derived pathogens in their organs or tissues. Since most enteric viruses involved in outbreaks cannot grow in cell culture, studies using viral surrogate models are essential. Some species are proposed as surrogates for enteric viruses in environmental samples, including in bivalve mollusk samples, such as murine norovirus type 1 (MNV-1) and somatic (as φX) or F-specific coliphages (as MS2) bacteriophages. This study evaluated the tissue distribution of viral surrogates for enteric virus contamination after their bioaccumulation by Crassostrea gigas. Oyster tissues were analyzed for the distribution of viral surrogates (MNV-1, φX-174, and MS2) in digestive tissue (DT), gills (GL), and mantle (MT) after 4, 6, and 24 h of experimental bioaccumulation. MNV-1 had higher counts at 6 h in DT (1.2 × 10<sup>3</sup> PFU/g), followed by GL and MT (9.5 × 10<sup>2</sup> and 3.8 × 10<sup>2</sup> PFU/g, respectively). The bacteriophage φX-174 had a higher concentration in the MT at 4 and 6 h (3.0 × 10<sup>2</sup> PFU/g, in both) and MS2 in the GL after 24 h (2.2 × 10<sup>2</sup> PFU/g). The bioaccumulation pattern of MNV-1 by oysters was similar to the other enteric viruses (more in DT), while that of phages followed distinct patterns from these. Since the MNV-1 is bioaccumulated by C. gigas and is adapted to grow in cell culture, it is an important tool for bioaccumulation and viral inactivation tests in oysters. Although bacteriophage bioaccumulation was not similar to enteric viruses, they can be indicated for viral bioaccumulation analysis, analyzing MT and GL, since they do not bioaccumulate in DT.

Title: Synergistic Antiviral Effects of Metal Oxides and Carbon Nanotubes.
Abstract: In this research, the synergistic antiviral effects of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and metal oxides (MO) in the form of novel hybrid structures (MO-CNTs) are presented. Raw CNTs, Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and MnO<sub>2</sub>, as well as Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-CNT, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-CNT and MnO<sub>2</sub>-CNT were explored in this study against <i>Escherichia. coli</i> MS2 bacteriophage, which was used as a virus surrogate. The nano particles were synthesized and characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), particle size analysis, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Kinetic parameters such as the LD<sub>50</sub> (lethal dose to kill 50% of the population), T<sub>50</sub> and T<sub>80</sub> (time taken to kill 50% and 80% of the population), SGR (specific growth rate) and IRD (initial rate of deactivation of the population) were also studied to examine the antiviral efficacy of these nanomaterials. Among all the nanomaterials, Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-CNT was the most effective antiviral agent followed by Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-CNT, MnO<sub>2</sub>-CNT, raw CNTs, Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and MnO<sub>2</sub>. When comparing the metal oxide-CNTs to the raw CNTs, the average enhancement was 20.2%. The average antiviral activity enhancement of the MO-CNTs were between 50 and 54% higher than the MO itself. When compared to the raw CNTs, the average enhancement over all the MO-CNTs was 20.2%. The kinetic studies showed that the LD<sub>50</sub> of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-CNT was the lowest (16µg/mL), which implies that it was the most toxic of all the compounds studied. The LD<sub>50</sub> of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and MnO<sub>2</sub> were 17.3×, 14.5× and 10.8× times greater than their corresponding hybrids with the CNTs. The synergistic mechanism involved the entrapment of phage viruses by the nano structured CNTs leading to structural damage along with toxicity to phage from the release of MO ions. The metal oxide-CNT nano hybrids developed in this project are promising candidates in applications such as antiviral coatings, nanocomposites, adsorbents and as components of personal protection gears.

Title: Persistence of surrogates for high consequence viral and bacterial pathogens in a pilot-scale activated sludge treatment system.
Abstract: The persistence of high consequence public health pathogens in a wastewater treatment system can significantly impact worker safety, as well as the public and downstream water bodies, particularly if the system is forced to shut down the treatment processes. This study utilizes organism viability to compare the persistence of three pathogen surrogates in wastewater using a pilot-scale activated sludge treatment (AST) system, operated to mimic treatment processes of large-scale plants. Bacillus globigii spores, surrogate for Bacillus anthracis, persisted in the AST system for at least a 50-day observation period leading to a possible steady condition far beyond the solid retention time for sludge particles. MS2 bacteriophage, surrogate for Poliovirus and other non-enveloped enteric viruses, was observed for up to 35 days after introduction, which largely and expectedly correlated to the measured solid retention time. Phi-6 bacteriophage, a surrogate for Ebola virus and other enveloped viruses, was detected for no more than 4 days after introduction, even though the AST system was operated to provide three times slower solids removal than for the other surrogates. This suggests Phi-6 is subject to inactivation under AST conditions rather than physical removal. These results may suggest similar persistence for the surrogated pathogens, leading to appropriate consequence management actions.

Title: Estimation of Nanoparticle's Surface Electrostatic Potential in Solution Using Acid-Base Molecular Probes. III. Experimental Hydrophobicity/Hydrophilicity and Charge Distribution of MS2 Virus Surface.
Abstract: MS2 bacteriophage is often used as a model for evaluating pathogenic viruses' behavior in aqueous solution. However, the questions of the virus surface's hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance, the charge distribution, and the binding mechanism are open. Using the dynamic light scattering method and laser Doppler electrophoresis, the hydrodynamic diameter and the ζ-potential of the virus particles were measured at their concentration of 5 × 10<sup>11</sup> particles per mL and ionic strength 0.03 M. The values were found to be 30 nm and -29 or -34 mV (by Smoluchowski or Ohshima approximations), respectively. The MS2 bacteriophage surface was also investigated using a series of acid-base indicator dyes of various charge type, size, and structure. Their spectral and acid-base properties (p<i>K</i><sub><i>a</i></sub>) are very sensitive to the microenvironment in aqueous solution, including containing nanoparticles. The electrostatic potential of the surface Ψ was estimated using the common formula: Ψ = 59 × (p<i>K</i><sub><i>a</i></sub><sup><i>i</i></sup> - p<i>K</i><sub><i>a</i></sub>) in mV at 25 °C. The Ψ values were -50 and +10 mV, respectively, which indicate the "mosaic" way of the charge distribution on the surface. These data are in good agreement with the obtained ζ-potential values and provide even more information about the virus surface. It was found that the surface of the MS2 virus is hydrophilic in solution in contrast to the commonly accepted hypothesis of the hydrophobicity of virus particles. No hydrophobic interactions between various molecular probes and the capsid were observed.

Title: Deposition kinetics of bacteriophage MS2 on Microcystis aeruginosa and kaolin surface.
Abstract: Waterborne virus contamination might easily adsorb on the organic or inorganic surface in the complex aquatic environment. A quartz crystal microbalance coupled with dissipation monitoring was used to investigate the effects of the ionic strength of monovalent cation and divalent cation and pH on the deposition kinetics of bacteriophage MS2 on silica surface coated with Microcystis aeruginosa or kaolin, which represents organic or inorganic particle, respectively. Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek theory was used to illustrate the deposition mechanisms of MS2. The increased concentration of Na<sup>+</sup> significantly enhanced the deposition rates of MS2 on both coated silica surfaces due to the reduction of repulsive electrostatic interactions. However, the MS2 deposition rates decreased at higher ionic strength of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which accounted for the steric and hydrophobic interactions. And the higher MS2 deposition rates on both surfaces occurred at pH 3. In addition, the deposition rates of MS2 on kaolin-coated silica surfaces were higher than on the Microcystis-coated surface under all studied conditions. Furthermore, the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek theory could elucidate the deposition mechanism in Na<sup>+</sup> solution, whereas the steric and hydrophobic interactions should be considered for the presence of high concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup>.

Abstract: Although electrospun nanomaterials containing photoactive dyes currently compete with the present state of art antimicrobial materials, relatively few structure-activity relationships have been established to identify the role of carrier polymer and photosensitizer binding mode on the performance of the materials. In this study scaffolds composed of poly(vinyl alcohol), polyacrylonitrile, poly(caprolactone), and tailor-made phthalocyanine-based photosensitizers are developed utilizing electrospinning as a simple, time and cost-effective method. The photoinduced activity of nanofibrous materials was characterized <i>in vitro</i> against <i>E. coli</i> and <i>B. subtilis</i> as models for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria respectively, as well as against bacteriophages phi6 and MS2 as models for enveloped and non-enveloped viruses respectively. For the first time, we show how polymer-specific properties affect antifouling and antimicrobial activity of the nanofibrous material, indicating that the most promising way to increase efficiency is likely <i>via</i> methods that focus on increasing the number of short, but strong and reversible bacteria-surface interactions.

Title: Removal of virus aerosols by the combination of filtration and UV-C irradiation.
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic remains ever prevalent and afflicting-partially because one of its transmission pathways is aerosol. With the widely used central air conditioning systems worldwide, indoor virus aerosols can rapidly migrate, thus resulting in rapid infection transmission. It is therefore important to install microbial aerosol treatment units in the air conditioning systems, and we herein investigated the possibility of combining such filtration with UV irradiation to address virus aerosols. Results showed that the removal efficiency of filtration towards f2 and MS2 phages depended on the type of commercial filter material and the filtration speed, with an optimal velocity of 5 cm/s for virus removal. Additionally, it was found that UV irradiation had a significant effect on inactivating viruses enriched on the surfaces of filter materials; MS2 phages had greater resistance to UV-C irradiation than f2 phages. The optimal inactivation time for UV-C irradiation was 30 min, with higher irradiation times presenting no substantial increase in inactivation rate. Moreover, excessive virus enrichment on the filters decreased the inactivation effect. Timely inactivation is therefore recommended. In general, the combined system involving filtration with UV-C irradiation demonstrated a significant removal effect on virus aerosols. Moreover, the system is simple and economical, making it convenient for widespread implementation in air-conditioning systems.

Title: Effectiveness of air-purifying devices and measures to reduce the exposure to bioaerosols in school classrooms.
Abstract: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which suddenly appeared at the beginning of 2020, revealed our knowledge deficits in terms of ventilation and air pollution control. It took many weeks to realize that aerosols are the main route of transmission. The initial attempt to hold back these aerosols through textile masks seemed almost helpless, although there is sufficient knowledge about the retention capacity of fabric filters for aerosols. In the absence of a sufficient number of permanently installed heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems, three main approaches are pursued: (a) increasing the air exchange rate by supplying fresh air, (b) using mobile air purifiers, and (c) disinfection by introducing active substances into the room air. This article discusses the feasibility of these different approaches critically. It also provides experimental results of air exchange measurements in a school classroom that is equipped with a built-in fan for supplying fresh air. With such a fan and a window tilted at the appropriate distance, an air exchange rate of 5/h can be set at a low power level and without any significant noise pollution. Heat balance calculations show that no additional heat exchanger is necessary in a normal classroom with outside temperatures above 10°C. Furthermore, a commercial mobile air purifier is studied in a chamber and a test room setup in order to examine and evaluate the efficiency of such devices against viable viruses under controlled and realistic conditions. For this purpose, bacteriophages of the type MS2 are used. Both window ventilation and air purifiers were found to be suitable to reduce the concentration of phages in the room.

Title: Genome-regulated Assembly of a ssRNA Virus May Also Prepare It for Infection.
Abstract: Many single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses regulate assembly of their infectious virions by forming multiple, cognate coat protein (CP)-genome contacts at sites termed Packaging Signals (PSs). We have determined the secondary structures of the bacteriophage MS2 ssRNA genome (gRNA) frozen in defined states using constraints from X-ray synchrotron footprinting (XRF). Comparison of the footprints from phage and transcript confirms the presence of multiple PSs in contact with CP dimers in the former. This is also true for a virus-like particle (VLP) assembled around the gRNA in vitro in the absence of the single-copy Maturation Protein (MP) found in phage. Since PS folds are present at many sites across gRNA transcripts, it appears that this genome has evolved to facilitate this mechanism of assembly regulation. There are striking differences between the gRNA-CP contacts seen in phage and the VLP, suggesting that the latter are inappropriate surrogates for aspects of phage structure/function. Roughly 50% of potential PS sites in the gRNA are not in contact with the protein shell of phage. However, many of these sit adjacent to, albeit not in contact with, PS-binding sites on CP dimers. We hypothesize that these act as PSs transiently during assembly but subsequently dissociate. Combining the XRF data with PS locations from an asymmetric cryo-EM reconstruction suggests that the genome positions of such dissociations are non-random and may facilitate infection. The loss of many PS-CP interactions towards the 3' end of the gRNA would allow this part of the genome to transit more easily through the narrow basal body of the pilus extruding machinery. This is the known first step in phage infection. In addition, each PS-CP dissociation event leaves the protein partner trapped in a non-lowest free-energy conformation. This destabilizes the protein shell which must disassemble during infection, further facilitating this stage of the life-cycle.

The emphasis on genome positions and structural changes during assembly could potentially inform strategies to alter the phage to not require DNAJ binding.

Title: CRISPR-Based Transcriptional Activation in Drosophila.
Abstract: Overexpression is one of the classical approaches to study pleiotropic functions of genes of interest. To achieve overexpression, we often increase the transcription by introducing genes on exogenous vectors or by using the CRISPR/dCas9-based transcriptional activation system. To date, the most efficient CRISPR/dCas9-based transcriptional activator is the Synergistic Activation Mediator (SAM) system whereby three different transcriptional activation domains are directly fused to dCas9 and MS2 phage Coat Protein (MCP), respectively, and the system in Drosophila is named flySAM. Here we describe the effective and convenient transcriptional activation system, flySAM, starting from vector construction, microinjection, and transgenic fly selection to the phenotypic analysis.

Title: Immersive ultraviolet disinfection of E. coli and MS2 phage on woven cotton textiles.
Abstract: Immersive ultraviolet disinfection provides a chemical-free technology for safer textiles, surfaces, and public spaces by inactivating communicable pathogens. This study examined immersive UV disinfection, using a disinfection cabinet, of E. coli and MS2 that was inoculated on white cotton T-shirts. The impact that porous materials have on UV disinfection is poorly understood with the majority of previous surface disinfection research focusing on hard, smooth surfaces. Several approaches were used in this study to characterize the light dynamics within the disinfection cabinet including colorimetric dosimetry coupons, biodosimetry, and spectroradiometry. Micro and macro geometry of porous surfaces are important factors to consider when using immersive UV technologies. The geometry of the cabinet impacted the distribution of emitted UV light within the disinfection cabinet and the physical properties of a porous material, such as the woven pattern of cotton, both contribute to UV disinfection efficiency. This work identified that light distribution is crucial for immersive UV technologies as the delivered fluence was highly variable within the disinfection cabinet and resulted in a difference of several logs of reduction for adjacent areas of T-shirt samples. Other inoculated areas achieved upwards of 1-log reductions values for MS2 and upwards of 2-log reductions for E. coli.

Title: Development of a magnetic nanoparticle-based method for concentrating SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater.
Abstract: Several virus concentration methods have been developed to increase the detection sensitivity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in wastewater, as part of applying wastewater-based epidemiology. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation method, a method widely used for concentrating viruses in wastewater, has some limitations, such as long processing time. In this study, Pegcision, a PEG-based method using magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), was applied to detect SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, with several modifications to increase its sensitivity and throughput. An enveloped virus surrogate, Pseudomonas phage φ6, and a non-enveloped virus surrogate, coliphage MS2, were seeded into wastewater samples and quantified using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction to assess the recovery performance of the Pegcision. Neither increasing MNP concentration nor reducing the reaction time to 10 min affected the recovery, while adding polyacrylic acid as a polyanion improved the detection sensitivity. The performance of the Pegcision was further compared to that of the PEG precipitation method based on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and surrogate viruses, including indigenous pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), in wastewater samples (n = 27). The Pegcision showed recovery of 14.1 ± 6.3 % and 1.4 ± 1.0 % for φ6 and MS2, respectively, while the PEG precipitation method showed recovery of 20.4 ± 20.2 % and 18.4 ± 21.9 % (n = 27 each). Additionally, comparable PMMoV concentrations were observed between the Pegcision (7.9 ± 0.3 log copies/L) and PEG precipitation methods (8.0 ± 0.2 log copies/L) (P > 0.05) (n = 27). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was successfully detected in 11 (41 %) each of 27 wastewater samples using the Pegcision and PEG precipitation methods. The Pegcision showed comparable performance with the PEG precipitation method for SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration, suggesting its applicability as a virus concentration method.

Title: Evaluating the impact of ultraviolet C exposure conditions on coliphage MS2 inactivation on surfaces.
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has raised interest in using devices that generate ultraviolet C (UVC) radiation as an alternative approach for reducing or eliminating microorganisms on surfaces. Studies investigating the efficacy of UVC radiation against pathogens use a wide range of laboratory methods and experimental conditions that can make cross-comparison of results and extrapolation of findings to real-world settings difficult. Here, we use three different UVC-generating sources - a broad-spectrum pulsed xenon light, a continuous light-emitting diode (LED), and a low-pressure mercury vapour lamp - to evaluate the impact of different experimental conditions on UVC efficacy against the coliphage MS2 on surfaces. We find that a nonlinear dose-response relationship exists for all three light sources, meaning that linear extrapolation of doses resulting in a 1-log<sub>10</sub> (90%) reduction does not accurately predict the dose required for higher (e.g. 3-log<sub>10</sub> or 99.9%) log<sub>10</sub> reductions. In addition, our results show that the inoculum characteristics and underlying substrate play an important role in determining UVC efficacy. Variations in microscopic surface topography may shield MS2 from UVC radiation to different degrees, which impacts UVC device efficacy. These findings are important to consider in comparing results from different UVC studies and in estimating device performance in field conditions.

Title: Novel sustainable filter for virus filtration and inactivation.
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a multi-scale impact on the world population that started from a nano-scale respiratory virus and led to the shutdown of macro-scale economies. Direct transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) and its variants through aerosolized droplets is a major contributor towards increasing cases of this infection. To curb the spread, one of the best engineered solutions is the use of face masks to prevent the passage of infectious saliva micro-droplets from an infected person to a healthy person. The commercially available masks are single use, passive face-piece filters. These become difficult to breathe in during strenuous activities. Also, they need to be disposed regularly due to accumulation of unwanted particulate and pathogens over time. Frequent disposal of these masks is unsustainable for the environment. In this study, we have proposed a novel design for a filter for enhanced virus filtration, better breathability, and virus inactivation over time. The filter is called Hy-Cu named after its (Hy) drophobic properties and another significant layer comprises of copper (Cu). The breathability (pressure drop across filter) of Hy-Cu is tested and compared with widely used surgical masks and KN95 masks, both experimentally and numerically. The results show that the Hy-Cu filter offers at least 10% less air resistance as compared to commercially available masks. The experimental results on virus filtration and inactivation tests using MS2 bacteriophage (a similar protein structure as SARS-CoV-2) show that the novel filter has 90% filtering efficiency and 99% virus inactivation over a period of 2 h. This makes the Hy-Cu filter reusable and a judicious substitute to the single use masks.

Title: Effect of particulate matters on inactivation of bacteriophage MS2 under irradiation above 320 nm.
Abstract: The inactivation of bacteriophage MS2 under irradiation above 320 nm was investigated, focusing on different solution pH, ionic strength, and Suwannee River natural organic matter (SRNOM) concentrations when solutions contained organic or inorganic particle matters. Inorganic and organic particles were modeled using kaolinite (KAO) and Microcystis aeruginosa (MA), respectively. The results showed that the two types of particles influenced on MS2 inactivation under different conditions. The lower pH contributed to the greater MS2 aggregation within pH range of 3.0 to 8.0, leading to an increasing inactivation rate. The presence of KAO induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) under the action of irradiation above 320 nm, which promoted the inactivation of MS2. By comparison, the [Formula: see text] produced by MA after irradiation promoted the inactivation at pH < 6, whereas when the pH is ≥ 6, the inactivation effect of MS2 was lower than that of particle-free solution because MS2 was no longer aggregated and MA has a shading effect. In the presence of Na<sup>+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup> cation, irradiation above 320 nm could not effectively inactivate the MS2 under particle-free solution. By comparison, KAO increased the inactivation efficiency as a photosensitizer. With the increase of Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, MS2 was more easily adsorbed to MA than aggregation. Until Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration reached 20 mM, the inactivation effect in MA solution was enhanced. In the presence of SRNOM, the inactivation effect increased with the increase of SRNOM concentration. When the SRNOM was 20 mM, the inactivation increased in the particle-free solution due to the greater production of [Formula: see text]. Compared with the particle-free solution, the KAO and MA inactivation efficiency was lower.

Title: Targeting of Silver Cations, Silver-Cystine Complexes, Ag Nanoclusters, and Nanoparticles towards SARS-CoV-2 RNA and Recombinant Virion Proteins.
Abstract: <b>Background</b>: Nanosilver possesses antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenesis, antiplatelet, and anticancer properties. The development of disinfectants, inactivated vaccines, and combined etiotropic and immunomodulation therapy against respiratory viral infections, including COVID-19, remains urgent. <b>Aim:</b> Our goal was to determine the SARS-CoV-2 molecular targets (genomic RNA and the structural virion proteins S and N) for silver-containing nanomaterials. <b>Methods:</b> SARS-CoV-2 gene cloning, purification of S2 and N recombinant proteins, viral RNA isolation from patients' blood samples, reverse transcription with quantitative real-time PCR ((RT)<sup>2</sup>-PCR), ELISA, and multiplex immunofluorescent analysis with magnetic beads (xMAP) for detection of 17 inflammation markers. <b>Results:</b> Fluorescent Ag nanoclusters (NCs) less than 2 nm with a few recovered silver atoms, citrate coated Ag nanoparticles (NPs) with diameters of 20-120 nm, and nanoconjugates of 50-150 nm consisting of Ag NPs with different protein envelopes were constructed from AgNO<sub>3</sub> and analyzed by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), ultraviolet-visible light absorption, and fluorescent spectroscopy. SARS-CoV-2 RNA isolated from COVID-19 patients' blood samples was completely cleaved with the artificial RNase complex compound Li<sup>+</sup>[Ag<sup>+</sup><sub>2</sub>Cys<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>(OH<sup>-</sup>)<sub>2</sub>(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] (Ag-2S), whereas other Ag-containing materials provided partial RNA degradation only. Treatment of the SARS-CoV-2 S2 and N recombinant antigens with AgNO<sub>3</sub> and Ag NPs inhibited their binding with specific polyclonal antibodies, as shown by ELISA. Fluorescent Ag NCs with albumin or immunoglobulins, Ag-2S complex, and nanoconjugates of Ag NPs with protein shells had no effect on the interaction between coronavirus recombinant antigens and antibodies. Reduced production of a majority of the 17 inflammation biomarkers after treatment of three human cell lines with nanosilver was demonstrated by xMAP. <b>Conclusion:</b> The antiviral properties of the silver nanomaterials against SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus differed. The small-molecular-weight artificial RNase Ag-2S provided exhaustive RNA destruction but could not bind with the SARS-CoV-2 recombinant antigens. On the contrary, Ag<sup>+</sup> ions and Ag NPs interacted with the SARS-CoV-2 recombinant antigens N and S but were less efficient at performing viral RNA cleavage. One should note that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was more stable than MS2 phage RNA. The isolated RNA of both the MS2 phage and SARS-CoV-2 were more degradable than the MS2 phage and coronavirus particles in patients' blood, due to the protection with structural proteins. To reduce the risk of the virus resistance, a combined treatment with Ag-2S and Ag NPs could be used. To prevent cytokine storm during the early stages of respiratory infections with RNA-containing viruses, nanoconjugates of Ag NPs with surface proteins could be recommended.

Title: The Effect of Zero-Valent Iron Nanoparticles (nZVI) on Bacteriophages.
Abstract: Bacteriophages are viruses that attack and usually kill bacteria. Their appearance in the industrial facilities using bacteria to produce active compounds (e.g., drugs, food, cosmetics, etc.) causes considerable financial losses. Instances of bacteriophage resistance towards disinfectants and decontamination procedures (such as thermal inactivation and photocatalysis) have been reported. There is a pressing need to explore new ways of phage inactivation that are environmentally neutral, inexpensive, and more efficient. Here, we study the effect of zero-valent iron nanoparticles (nZVI) on four different bacteriophages (T4, T7, MS2, M13). The reduction of plaque-forming units (PFU) per mL varies from greater than 7log to around 0.5log depending on bacteriophages (M13 and T7, respectively). A comparison of the importance of oxidation of nZVI versus the release of Fe<sup>2+</sup>/Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions is shown. The mechanism of action is proposed in connection to redox reactions, adsorption of virions on nZVI, and the effect of released iron ions. The nZVI constitutes a critical addition to available antiphagents (i.e., anti-bacteriophage agents).

Title: Removal of MS2 and fr Bacteriophages Using MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-Modified, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-Stabilized Porous Ceramic Granules for Drinking Water Treatment.
Abstract: Point-of-use ceramic filters are one of the strategies to address problems associated with waterborne diseases to remove harmful microorganisms in water sources prior to its consumption. In this study, development of adsorption-based ceramic depth filters composed of alumina platelets was achieved using spray granulation (calcined at 800 °C). Their virus retention performance was assessed using cartridges containing granular material (4 g) with two virus surrogates: MS2 and fr bacteriophages. Both materials showed complete removal, with a 7 log<sub>10</sub> reduction value (LRV) of MS2 up to 1 L. MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-modified Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> granules possessed a higher MS2 retention capacity, contrary to the shortcomings of retention limits in pure Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> granules. No significant decline in the retention of fr occurred during filtration tests up to 2 L. The phase composition and morphology of the materials were preserved during filtration, with no magnesium or aluminum leakage during filtration, as confirmed by X-ray diffractograms, electron micrographs, and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry. The proposed MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-modified Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> granular ceramic filter materials offer high virus retention, achieving the criterion for virus filtration as required by the World Health Organization (LRV ≥ 4). Owing to their high thermal and chemical stability, the developed materials are thus suitable for thermal and chemical-free regeneration treatments.

Title: Lack of Cas13a inhibition by anti-CRISPR proteins from Leptotrichia prophages.
Abstract: CRISPR systems are prokaryotic adaptive immune systems that use RNA-guided Cas nucleases to recognize and destroy foreign genetic elements. To overcome CRISPR immunity, bacteriophages have evolved diverse families of anti-CRISPR proteins (Acrs). Recently, Lin et al. (2020) described the discovery and characterization of 7 Acr families (AcrVIA1-7) that inhibit type VI-A CRISPR systems. We detail several inconsistencies that question the results reported in the Lin et al. (2020) study. These include inaccurate bioinformatics analyses and bacterial strains that are impossible to construct. Published strains were provided by the authors, but MS2 bacteriophage plaque assays did not support the published results. We also independently tested the Acr sequences described in the original report, in E. coli and mammalian cells, but did not observe anti-Cas13a activity. Taken together, our data and analyses prompt us to question the claim that AcrVIA1-7 reported in Lin et al. are type VI anti-CRISPR proteins.

Title: The Overlooked Photochemistry of Iodine in Aqueous Suspensions of Fullerene Derivatives.
Abstract: Fullerene's low water solubility was a serious challenge to researchers aiming to harness their excellent photochemical properties for aqueous applications. Cationic functionalization of the fullerene cage provided the most effective approach to increase water solubility, but common synthesis practices inadvertently complicated the photochemistry of these systems by introducing iodide as a counterion. This problem was overlooked until recent work noted a potentiation effect which occurred when photosensitizers were used to inactivate microorganisms with added potassium iodide. In this work, several photochemical pathways were explored to determine the extent and underlying mechanisms of iodide's interference in the photosensitization of singlet oxygen by cationic fulleropyrrolidinium ions and rose bengal. Triplet excited state sensitizer lifetimes were measured via laser flash photolysis to probe the role of I<sup>-</sup> in triplet sensitizer quenching. Singlet oxygen production rates were compared across sensitizers in the presence or absence of I<sup>-</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, and other anions. 3,5-Dimethyl-1<i>H</i>-pyrazole was employed as a chemical probe for iodine radical species, such as I·, but none were observed in the photochemical systems. Molecular iodine and triiodide, however, were found in significant quantities when photosensitizers were irradiated in the presence of I<sup>-</sup> and O<sub>2</sub>. The formation of I<sub>2</sub> in these photochemical systems calls into question the interpretations of prior studies that used I<sup>-</sup> as a counterion for photosensitizer materials. As an example, MS2 bacteriophages were inactivated here by cationic fullerenes with and without I<sup>-</sup> present, showing that I<sup>-</sup> moderately accelerated the MS2 deactivation, likely by producing I<sub>2</sub>. Production of I<sub>2</sub> did not appear to be directly correlated with estimates of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> concentration, suggesting that the relevant photochemical pathways are more complex than direct reactions between <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> and I<sup>-</sup> in the bulk solution. On the basis of the results here, iodine photochemistry may be underappreciated and misunderstood in other environmental systems.

Title: Virus removal from drinking water using modified activated carbon fibers.
Abstract: Activated carbon (AC) exhibits superior sorption properties compared to other porous materials, due to well-developed porous structures and high surface areas. Therefore, it is widely applied in its various forms in water purification to remove a diverse range of contaminating species. The presence of viruses in fresh water bodies poses a serious issue for human health. However, AC has not yet been commonly applied to waterborne virus removal. In this study, we present oxidation and copper impregnation treatment procedures of activated carbon fibers (ACFs) that resulted in porous structure and surface chemistry modifications. The effect of these modifications on virus removal was investigated by experimental flow studies and revealed up to 2.8 log<sub>10</sub> reduction value (LRV) and 3.6 LRV of MS2 bacterio-phages for non-modified and oxidized ACFs, respectively, emphasizing the advantages of ACF surface functionalization. Copper modified fibers demonstrated a high sensitivity to media composition, resulting in a release of metal and therefore limited virucidal capacity.

Title: Potential SARS-CoV-2 contamination of groundwater as a result of mass burial: A mini-review.
Abstract: The recent COVID-19 disease has highlighted the need for further research around the risk to human health and the environment because of mass burial of COVID-19 victims. Despite SARS-CoV-2 being an enveloped virus, which is highly susceptible to environmental conditions (temperature, solar/UV exposure). This review provides insight into the potential of SARS-CoV-2 to contaminate groundwater through burial sites, the impact of various types of burial practices on SARS-CoV-2 survival, and current knowledge gaps that need to be addressed to ensure that humans and ecosystems are adequately protected from SARS-CoV-2. Data available shows temperature is still likely to be the driving factor when it comes to survival and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. Research conducted at cemetery sites globally using various bacteriophages (MS2, PRD1, faecal coliforms) and viruses (TGEV, MHV) as surrogates for pathogenic enteric viruses to study the fate and transport of these viruses showed considerable contamination of groundwater, particularly where there is a shallow vadose zone and heterogeneous structures are known to exist with very low residence times. In addition, changes in solution chemistry (e.g., decrease in ionic strength or increase in pH) during rainfall events produces large pulses of released colloids that can result in attached viruses becoming remobilised, with implications for groundwater contamination. Viruses cannot spread unaided through the vadose zone. Since groundwater is too deep to be in contact with the interred body and migration rates are very slow, except where preferential flow paths are known to exist, the groundwater table will not be significantly impacted by contamination from SARS-CoV-2. When burial takes place using scientifically defensible methods the possibility of infection will be highly improbable. Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has helped us to prepare for other eventualities such as natural disasters where mass fatalities and subsequently burials may take place in a relatively short space of time.

Highly cleaned and sterile unbleached cotton has constituents that produce hydrogen peroxide at levels commensurate with those that favor cell signaling in wound healing. Here, we show the antimicrobial and antiviral properties of spunlaced griege cotton-containing nonwovens treated with ascorbic acid formulations. The mechanism of action occurs through the promotion of enhanced hydrogen peroxide activity. The levels of hydrogen peroxide activity afford antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and antiviral activity against MS2 bacteriophages. Spun-bond nonwoven unbleached cotton was treated with ascorbic acid using traditional pad-dry-cure methods. An assessment of antibacterial and antiviral activity against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, and MS2 bacteriophages with the AATCC 100 test method showed a 99.99% inhibitory activity. An approach to the covalent attachment of ascorbic to cellulose through citric acid crosslinking chemistry is also discussed. Thus, a simple, low-cost approach to antimicrobial and antiviral cotton-based nonwovens applicable to dressings, nosocomial barrier fabrics, and face masks can be adopted by combining ascorbic acid with spunlace greige cotton nonwoven fabrics.

Title: Phenolic compounds of Phellinus spp. with antibacterial and antiviral activities.
Abstract: Phellinus Quél is one of the largest genera of Hymenochaetaceae; it comprises about 220 species widely distributed on Earth. Most Phellinus species are lignicolous mushrooms that accumulate bioactive compounds. This research studied the phenolic composition of Phellinus spp. and their relationship with antibacterial and antiviral capacity. Phenolics were extracted from Phellinus badius, P. fastuosus, and P. grenadensis; their antiviral and antibacterial activities were evaluated against Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica, and Escherichia coli O157: H7; and the bacteriophages MS2 and Φ- × 174. Gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, epicatechin, ferulic acid, catechin, 1,3-dicaffeoylquinic acid, p-coumaric acid, and rutin were found in different proportions among Phellinus spp. Total phenolic content ranged from 96 to 209 mg GAE/g, and total flavonoids from 10 to 27 QE/g. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of P. badius, P. grenadensis, and P. fastuosus against E. coli O157: H7 were 13, 20, and 27 mg/mL, against S. enterica were 20, 30, and 15 mg/mL, and against L. monocytogenes were 10, 15, and 25 mg/mL, respectively. The phenolic content was better correlated with the antibacterial effect against E. coli O157: H7 and L. monocytogenes (r = 0.8-0.9), but not against S. enterica (r = 0.05). The antiviral activity of the extracts (0.9 mg/mL) was 29 to 41% against MS2 and 27 to 38% for Φ-X174 virus (r = 0.8-0.9). In silico analysis showed binding energy values of - 7.9 and - 4.8 kcal/mol between the identified phenolic compounds and the M and G proteins of each virus. The antibacterial and antiviral properties of Phellinus species were correlated with the phenolic content.

Title: In vitro characterisation of the MS2 RNA polymerase complex reveals host factors that modulate emesviral replicase activity.
Abstract: The RNA phage MS2 is one of the most important model organisms in molecular biology and virology. Despite its comprehensive characterisation, the composition of the RNA replication machinery remained obscure. Here, we characterised host proteins required to reconstitute the functional replicase in vitro. By combining a purified replicase sub-complex with elements of an in vitro translation system, we confirmed that the three host factors, EF-Ts, EF-Tu, and ribosomal protein S1, are part of the active replicase holocomplex. Furthermore, we found that the translation initiation factors IF1 and IF3 modulate replicase activity. While IF3 directly competes with the replicase for template binding, IF1 appears to act as an RNA chaperone that facilitates polymerase readthrough. Finally, we demonstrate in vitro formation of RNAs containing minimal motifs required for amplification. Our work sheds light on the MS2 replication machinery and provides a new promising platform for cell-free evolution.

Title: UV-C Light-Based Surface Disinfection: Analysis of Its Virucidal Efficacy Using a Bacteriophage Model.
Abstract: Background: The reprocessing of medical devices has become more complex due to increasing hygiene requirements. Previous studies showed satisfactory bactericidal disinfection effects of UV-C light in rigid and flexible endoscopes. Especially in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, virucidal properties are of high importance. In the present study, the virucidal efficacy of UV-C light surface disinfection was analyzed. Methods: MS-2 bacteriophages were applied to the test samples and irradiated by UV-C light using the UV Smart D25 device; unirradiated test samples were used as controls. A dilution series of the samples was mixed with 1 × 108 Escherichia coli and assayed. Results: 8.6 × 1012 pfu could be harvested from the unprocessed test samples. In the control group without UV-C exposure, a remaining contamination of 1.2 × 1012 pfu was detected, resulting in a procedural baseline reduction rate with a LOG10 reduction factor of 0.72. The LOG10 reduction factor was found to be 3.0 after 25 s of UV-C light exposure. After 50 and 75 s of UV-C radiation LOG10 reduction factors 4.2 and 5.9, respectively, were found, with all reductions being statistically significantly different to baseline. Conclusions: The tested UV system seems to provide a significant virucidal effect after a relatively short irradiation time.

Title: Transfer of MS2 bacteriophage from surfaces to raspberry and pitanga fruits and virus survival in response to sanitization, frozen storage and preservation technologies.
Abstract: This study assessed the norovirus (NoV) surrogate bacteriophage MS2 transfer from stainless steel, glass and low-density polypropylene surfaces to raspberry and pitanga fruits. The effect of sodium hypochlorite (100 ppm, 1 min) on MS2 survival on whole fruits, the MS2 survival in sanitized fruits and derived pulps during frozen storage, and in response to preservation technologies (heat, organic acids and salts) was also assessed. The highest (p < 0.05) viral transfer (%) was observed from glass and stainless steel (∼90%) to raspberry, and from glass and polypropylene (∼75%) to pitanga, after 60 min of contact. Sodium hypochlorite reduced (p < 0.05) MS2 titer by 3.5 and 3.8 log PFU/g in raspberry and pitanga, respectively. MS2 decreased (p < 0.05) up to 1.4 log PFU/g in frozen stored sanitized fruits (whole fruits and pulps) after 15 days, with no further changes after 30 days. Thermal treatments reduced MS2 titer (p < 0.05) in both fruit pulps. MS2 inactivation was higher in pitanga pulp. The addition of ascorbic acid, citric acid, sodium benzoate, or sodium metabisulfite had little effect (<1 log PFU/g) on MS2 concentration in either fruit. These results may inform NoV risk management practice in processing and handling of fruits.

Title: Evaluation of a virus concentration method based on ultrafiltration and wet foam elution for studying viruses from large-volume water samples.
Abstract: Assessing the presence of viruses in large-volume samples involves cumbersome methods that require specialized training and laboratory equipment. In this study, a large volume concentration (LVC) method, based on dead-end ultrafiltration (DEUF) and Wet Foam Elution™ technology, was evaluated in different type of waters and different microorganisms. Its recovery efficiency was evaluated through different techniques (infectivity assays and molecular detection) by spiking different viral surrogates (bacteriophages PhiX174 and MS2 and Coxsackie virus B5 (CVB5) and Escherichia coli (E. coli). Furthermore, the application of a secondary concentration step was evaluated and compared with skimmed milk flocculation. Viruses present in river water, seawater and groundwater samples were concentrated by applying LVC method and a centrifugal ultrafiltration device (CeUF), as a secondary concentration step and quantified with specific qPCR Human adenoviruses (HAdV) and noroviruses (NoVs). MS2 was used as process control, obtaining a mean viral recovery of 22.0 ± 12.47%. The presence of other viruses was also characterized by applying two different next-generation sequencing approaches. LVC coupled to a secondary concentration step based on CeUF allowed to detect naturally occurring viruses such as HAdV and NoVs in different water matrices. Using HAdV as a human fecal indicator, the highest viral pollution was found in river water samples (100% of positive samples), followed by seawater (83.33%) and groundwater samples (66.67%). The LVC method has also proven to be useful as a virus concentration method in the filed since HAdV and NoVs were detected in the river water and groundwater samples concentrated in the field. All in all, LVC method presents high concentration factor and a low limit of detection and provides viral concentrates useful for subsequent molecular analysis such as PCR and massive sequencing.

Title: New method to quantify hydrophobicity of non-enveloped virions in aqueous media by capillary zone electrophoresis.
Abstract: The hydrophobicity of virions is a major physicochemical parameter regulating their dissemination in humans and the environment. But knowledge about potential factors modulating virion hydrophobicity is limited due to the lack of suitable quantifying methods. It has been recently shown that sodium dodecyl-sulfate (SDS) labels capsid hydrophobic domains in capillary zone electrophoresis of non-enveloped virions, altering their electrophoretic mobility (μ) in proportion to their hydrophobicity. This was exploited here to quantify the hydrophobicity of GA, Qβ and MS2 phages as a function of pH. By subtracting the native from the SDS-modified μ of phages, measured in the absence and presence of SDS, respectively, we defined a "hydrophobic index" increasing with virion hydrophobicity. Using this approach, we found that the virion hydrophobicity changes at a virion-specific pivotal pH. This procedure may be applied under various physicochemical conditions and to diverse non-enveloped virus families of significance to human health and the environment.

Title: Attachment, re-mobilization, and inactivation of bacteriophage MS2 during bank filtration following simulation of a high virus load and an extreme rain event.
Abstract: Viruses, including human pathogenic viruses, can persist in water. For producing drinking water from surface water via bank filtration, natural attenuation capacities and the fate of viruses during the passage of aquatic sediments are of particular interest. Moreover, the increasing frequency of extreme hydrological events necessitate re-evaluation of the sustainability and efficacy of processes removing viruses. For this purpose, we performed bank sediment filtration experiments using a mesocosm in a technical-scale experimental facility that simulates a field situation under more tightly controlled conditions. We used the bacteriophage MS2 as a surrogate for enteric viruses to study the transport of different viral loads through the bank sediment. Additionally, we simulated a heavy rain event to investigate the re-mobilization of initially attached virus particles. We quantified the abundance of infectious MS2 phages by plaque assay and the total number of MS2 particles by qPCR. Also, we differentiated pore water concentrations by depths of the sediment column and investigated attachment to the sediment matrix at the end of the individual experimental phases. Bank filtration over a vertical distance of 80 cm through sandy sediment revealed a virus removal efficiency of 0.8 log<sub>10</sub> for total MS2 particles and 1.7 log<sub>10</sub> for infectious MS2 particles, with an initial phage concentration of 1.84 × 10<sup>8</sup> gene copies mL<sup>-1</sup>. A low load of infectious MS2 (1.9 × 10<sup>6</sup> plaque forming units mL<sup>-1</sup>) resulted in a greater removal efficiency (3.0 log<sub>10</sub>). The proportion of infectious MS2 phages of the total MS2 particle mass steadily decreased over time, i.e., in the course of individual breakthrough curves and with sediment depth. The simulated pulse of rainwater caused a front of low ionic strength water which resulted in pronounced phage remobilization. The high proportion of infectious MS2 among the detached phages indicated that attachment to the sediment matrix may substantially conserve virus infectivity. Therefore, the re-mobilization of previously attached viruses owing to hydrological extremes should be considered in water quality assessment and monitoring schemes.

Title: Microbial reductions and physical characterization of chitosan flocs when using chitosan acetate as a cloth filter aid in water treatment.
Abstract: The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates 2.1 billion people lack access to safely managed water. Cloth filtration is often employed in rural and developing communities of South Asia for point-of-use water treatment, but bacteria and viruses are too small for efficient removal by this filtration method. Chitosan is a biodegradable, cationic, organic polymer derived from the chemical treatment of chitin that acts as a coagulant and flocculant of contaminant of microbes and other particles in water, thereby facilitating filtration of microbes. This research 1) evaluated the use of chitosan acetate as a pre-treatment coagulation-flocculation process followed by cloth filtration for microbial reductions and 2) assessed floc particle size under three stirring conditions. E. coli KO11 bacteria and MS2 coliphage virus removals were quantified using culture-based methods. Chitosan acetate coagulation-flocculation pre-treatment of water, followed by cloth filtration, met or exceeded the protective (2-star) WHO performance levels for bacteria (2 log10 reduction) and viruses (3 log10 reduction), and filtrate turbidity was consistently reduced to < 1 NTU, meeting United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and WHO targets.

Title: Reactivity of Viral Nucleic Acids with Chlorine and the Impact of Virus Encapsidation.
Abstract: Free chlorine disinfection is widely applied to inactivate viruses by reacting with their biomolecules, which include nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids. Knowing the reactivities of viral genomes with free chlorine and the protection that encapsidation provides would ultimately help predict virus susceptibility to the disinfectant. The relative reactivities of different viral genome types and the impact of viral higher order structure with free chlorine are poorly characterized. Here, we studied the reactivity of viral genomes representing four genome types from virus particles with diverse structures, namely, (+)ssRNA (MS2), dsRNA (φ6), ssDNA (φX174), and dsDNA (T3) with free chlorine. We compared the reactivities of these viral nucleic acids when they were suspended in phosphate buffer solutions (naked forms) and when they were in the native virus particles (encapsidated forms). The reactivities of nucleic acids were tracked by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays. The naked dsDNA of T3 was the least reactive with free chlorine, with an average second order rate constant normalized by the number of bases in the measured regions (in M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> b<sup>-1</sup>) that was 34×, 65×, and 189× lower than those of the dsRNA of φ6, ssRNA of MS2, and ssDNA of φX174, respectively. Moreover, different regions in the ssRNA genome of MS2 and the dsRNA genome of φ6 exhibited statistically different reaction kinetics. The genomes within virus particles reacted slower than the naked genomes overall, but the extent of these differences varied among the four viruses. The results on viral nucleic acid reactivity help explain different susceptibilities of viruses to inactivation by free chlorine and also provide a valuable comparison of the susceptibilities of different nucleic acids to oxidants.

Title: Persistence of viable MS2 and Phi6 bacteriophages on carpet and dust.
Abstract: Resuspension of dust from flooring is a major source of human exposure to microbial contaminants, but the persistence of viruses on dust and carpet and the contribution to human exposure are often unknown. The goal of this work is to determine viability of MS2 and Phi6 bacteriophages on cut carpet, looped carpet, and house dust both over time and after cleaning. Bacteriophages were nebulized onto carpet or dust in artificial saliva. Viability was measured at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 24, and 48 h and after cleaning by vacuum, steam, hot water extraction, and disinfection. MS2 bacteriophages showed slower viability decay rates in dust (-0.11 hr<sup>-1</sup> ), cut carpet (-0.20 hr<sup>-1</sup> ), and looped carpet (-0.09 hr<sup>-1</sup> ) compared to Phi6 (-3.36 hr<sup>-1</sup> , -1.57 hr<sup>-1</sup> , and -0.20 hr<sup>-1</sup> , respectively). Viable viral concentrations were reduced to below the detection limit for steam and disinfection for both MS2 and Phi6 (p < 0.05), while vacuuming and hot water extraction showed no significant changes in concentration from uncleaned carpet (p > 0.05). These results demonstrate that MS2 and Phi6 bacteriophages can remain viable in carpet and dust for several hours to days, and cleaning with heat and disinfectants may be more effective than standard vacuuming.

Title: Inactivation of MS2 bacteriophage on copper film deployed in high touch areas of a public transport system.
Abstract: Although SARS-CoV-2 is primarily an airborne risk, the COVID-19 pandemic also highlighted the need for self-disinfection surfaces that could withstand the demand of high occupant densities characteristic of public transportation systems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the durability and antiviral activity of a copper film deployed for 90 days in two high touch locations within an active metropolitan bus and railcar. The antiviral efficacy of this copper film after being deployed in transit vehicles for 90 days (deployed copper film) was then compared to new (unused) copper film to determine if frequent touches and cleaning protocols could decrease the efficacy of the copper films. Deployed copper film, new copper film, and aluminium foil (positive control) coupons were inoculated with ~1 × 10<sup>6</sup> MS2 virus particles, allowed a contact time of either 5- or 10-min, and analysed for residual viral infectiousness. On both new and deployed copper films, MS2 was completely inactivated (≥5 log reduction) at both time points. These results suggest that the copper film may provide the durability demanded by high touch public spaces while maintaining the antiviral activity necessary to reduce exposure risk and viral transmission via surfaces in public transportation settings.

Title: Selected Mechanistic Aspects of Viral Inactivation by Peracetic Acid.
Abstract: Peracetic acid (PAA) is an alternative to traditional wastewater disinfection as it has a high oxidation potential without producing chlorinated disinfection byproducts. Reports have shown the effectiveness of PAA to reduce waterborne viruses, but the mechanism of inactivation is understudied. This study evaluated PAA consumption by amino acids and nucleotides that are the building blocks of both viral capsids and genomes. Cysteine (>1.7 min<sup>-1</sup>) and methionine (>1.2 min<sup>-1</sup>) rapidly consumed PAA, while cystine (1.9 × 10<sup>-2</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>) and tryptophan (1.4 × 10<sup>-4</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>) reactions occurred at a slower rate. All other amino acids and nucleotides did not react significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.05) with PAA during experiments. Also, PAA treatment did not result in significant (<i>p</i> < 0.05) reductions of purified RNA from MS2 bacteriophage and murine norovirus. Data in this study suggest that PAA effectively inactivates viruses by targeting susceptible amino acids on capsid proteins and does not readily damage viral genomes. Knowledge of virus capsid structures and protein compositions can be used to qualitatively predict the relative resistance or susceptibility of virus types to PAA. Capsid structures containing a higher total number of target amino acids may be more susceptible to PAA reactions that damage structural integrity resulting in inactivation.

Title: Viral pathogens in urban stormwater runoff: Occurrence and removal via vegetated biochar-amended biofilters.
Abstract: Urban runoff is one of the greatest sources of microbial pollution to surface waters. Biofilters can limit the impact of stormwater runoff on surface water quality by diverting runoff from receiving waters. However, our understanding of how biofilter design choices, including the addition of vegetation and geomedia, may impact the removal of pathogens is lacking. In this study, we characterized viruses (adenovirus, enterovirus, norovirus GII, crAssphage) in San Francisco Bay area urban runoff and assessed the removal of lab-cultured viruses (MS2, adenovirus 2, coxsackievirus B5) from biochar-amended biofilter mesocosms during challenge testing. We quantified viruses using (RT-)qPCR and F+ coliphage plaque assays. We found that all the pathogenic viruses targeted were found at low concentrations (adenovirus: all positive samples were <limit of quantification, enterovirus: <limit of quantification-1.9 × 10<sup>2</sup> gc/L, norovirus GII: <limit of quantification-1.2 × 10<sup>2</sup> gc/L) in San Francisco Bay area urban runoff and the presence of norovirus GII in runoff was associated with developed land use and decreased precipitation. Biofilters had variable success in removing adenovirus, enterovirus, and MS2 from runoff in laboratory-scale column experiments. In addition, there was no significant difference in the removal of each virus in vegetated versus non-vegetated biofilters, with the exception of MS2 which had slightly higher removal in vegetated biofilters (0.40 log<sub>10</sub> units, Welch's t-test, p = 0.004). When comparing removal of human viruses and viral indicators, adenovirus and enterovirus were removed more efficiently (log<sub>10-</sub>removal adenovirus = 3.2; log<sub>10</sub>-removal enterovirus = 1.1) than indicator virus MS2 (log<sub>10</sub>-removal by RT-qPCR = 0.36, log<sub>10</sub>-removal by plaque assay = 0.36). These results provide evidence that MS2 may be a conservative indicator for human virus removal in biofiltration systems, but more work is needed to examine this relationship. Results from this study can help inform design choices regarding biofilters intended to improve water quality and our understanding of virus attenuation in biofiltration systems.

Title: Delivery of microRNA-21-sponge and pre-microRNA-122 by MS2 virus-like particles to therapeutically target hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
Abstract: MicroRNAs are related to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma and can serve as potential therapeutic targets. Therapeutic strategies increasing tumor-suppressive microRNAs and reducing oncogenic microRNAs have been developed. Herein, the effects of simultaneously altering two microRNAs using MS2 virus-like particles were studied. The sequences of microRNA-21-sponge and pre-microRNA-122 were connected and cloned into a virus-like particle expression vector. Virus-like particles containing microRNA-21-sponge and pre-microRNA-122 sequences were prepared and crosslinked with a cell-specific peptide targeting hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Delivery effects were studied using RT-qPCR and functional assays to investigate the level of target mRNAs, cell toxicity, and the effects of proliferation, invasion, and migration. Virus-like particles delivered miR-21-sponge into cells, with the Ct value reaching 10 at most. The linked pre-miR-122 was processed into mature miR-122. The mRNA targets of miR-21 were derepressed as predicted and upregulated 1.2-2.8-fold, and the expression of proteins was elevated correspondingly. Proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells were inhibited by miR-21-sponge. Simultaneous delivery of miR-21-sponge and miR-122 further decreased proliferation, migration, and invasion by up to 34%, 63%, and 65%, respectively. And the combination promoted the apoptosis of HCC cells. In conclusion, delivering miR-21-sponge and miR-122 using virus-like particles modified by cell-specific peptides is an effective and convenient strategy to correct microRNA dysregulation in hepatocellular carcinoma cells and is a promising therapeutic strategy for hepatocellular carcinoma.

Title: Optimizing the synthesis and purification of MS2 virus like particles.
Abstract: Introducing bacteriophage MS2 virus-like particles (VLPs) as gene and drug delivery tools increases the demand for optimizing their production and purification procedure. PEG precipitation method is used efficiently to purify VLPs, while the effects of pH and different electrolytes on the stability, size, and homogeneity of purified MS2 VLPs, and the encapsulated RNA sequences remained to be elucidated. In this regard, a vector, capable of producing VLP with an shRNA packed inside was prepared. The resulting VLPs in different buffers/solutions were assessed for their size, polydispersity index, and ability to protect the enclosed shRNA. We report that among Tris, HEPES, and PBS, with or without NaNO3, and also NaNO3 alone in different pH and ionic concentrations, the 100 mM NaNO3-Tris buffer with pH:8 can be used as a new and optimal MS2 VLP production buffer, capable of inhibiting the VLPs aggregation. These VLPs show a size range of 27-30 nm and suitable homogeneity with minimum 12-month stability at 4 °C. Moreover, the resulting MS2 VLPs were highly efficient and stable for at least 48 h in conditions similar to in vivo. These features of MS2 VLPs produced in the newly introduced buffer make them an appropriate candidate for therapeutic agents' delivery.

Title: Selection of a SARS-CoV-2 Surrogate for Use in Surface Disinfection Efficacy Studies with Chlorine and Antimicrobial Surfaces.
Abstract: Initial recommendations for surface disinfection to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission were developed using previous evidence from potential surrogates. To the best of our knowledge, no appropriate surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 has been identified or confirmed for chlorine and antimicrobial surface disinfection. We completed a study to evaluate the efficacy of two hypothesized antimicrobial surfaces, and four chlorine solutions on nonporous and porous surfaces, against SARS-CoV-2 and three potential SARS-CoV-2 surrogates [coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and bacteriophages Phi6 and MS2], to identify a BSL-1 or BSL-2 virus to use in future studies. We found SARS-CoV-2 can be reduced >4 log<sub>10</sub> on porous and nonporous surfaces within 30 s upon exposure to 0.5% NaOCl. The results indicate coronavirus MHV-GFP is inactivated faster than SARS-CoV-2 (MHV-GFP ≥ 6.08 log<sub>10</sub>; SARS-CoV-2 = 0.66 log<sub>10</sub> at 30 s with 0.05% NaOCl on steel) and MS2 is inactivated more slowly. Phi6 is inactivated like SARS-CoV-2, and we propose Phi6 as a slightly conservative surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 chlorine disinfection. Additionally, disinfection of bacteriophages on wood was challenging, and exposure to antimicrobial surfaces had no disinfection efficacy as tested. We recommend using 0.5% chlorine on surfaces for a minimum of 30 s of contact to disinfect SARS-CoV-2 and recommend additional research on Phi6 disinfection with varied surfaces and conditions.

Title: Characterizing hydrogen bonds in intact RNA from MS2 bacteriophage using magic angle spinning NMR.
Abstract: RNA is a polymer with pivotal functions in many biological processes. RNA structure determination is thus a vital step toward understanding its function. The secondary structure of RNA is stabilized by hydrogen bonds formed between nucleotide basepairs, and it defines the positions and shapes of functional stem-loops, internal loops, bulges, and other functional and structural elements. In this work, we present a methodology for studying large intact RNA biomolecules using homonuclear <sup>15</sup>N solid-state NMR spectroscopy. We show that proton-driven spin-diffusion experiments with long mixing times, up to 16 s, improved by the incorporation of multiple rotor-synchronous <sup>1</sup>H inversion pulses (termed radio-frequency dipolar recoupling pulses), reveal key hydrogen-bond contacts. In the full-length RNA isolated from MS2 phage, we observed strong and dominant contributions of guanine-cytosine Watson-Crick basepairs, and beyond these common interactions, we observe a significant contribution of the guanine-uracil wobble basepairs. Moreover, we can differentiate basepaired and non-basepaired nitrogen atoms. Using the improved technique facilitates characterization of hydrogen-bond types in intact large-scale RNA using solid-state NMR. It can be highly useful to guide secondary structure prediction techniques and possibly structure determination methods.

Title: [Characteristics and Mechanisms of Bacteriophage MS2 Inactivation in Water by UV Activated Sodium Persulfate].
Abstract: Viruses in the aquatic environment have strong resistance to common disinfection techniques. To contribute to the development of efficient virus inactivation technologies, the characteristics and mechanisms of virus inactivation in a UV activated sodium persulfate(UV/PS) system were studied. The inactivation rate and kinetic characteristics of bacteriophage MS2 in water samples by the UV/PS were studied. The effects of PS dosage, pH, and the initial concentration of bacteriophages on the inactivation effect were also investigated. Furthermore, the morphologies of phages before and after UV/PS treatment were observed by transmission scanning electron microscope, and the free radicals in the reaction system were identified by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. By means of a free radical quenching experiment, the contribution rate of various factors in the UV/PS system to phage inactivation was also analyzed and calculated. The results showed that when the UV irradiation intensity was 160 μW·cm<sup>-2</sup>, the phage MS2 of 4.39 lg could be removed after UV/PS treatment for 4 min, which was 1.44 lg higher than that of the same UV dose alone. The inactivation of phage MS2 by the UV/PS system was in accordance with the first-order kinetic model. Increasing the initial concentration of PS in the system significantly improved the inactivation rate of phages, while pH and the initial concentration of phages had little effect on the inactivation rate. UV/PS treatment damages the capsid of phages and promotes the aggregation of phage particles. The presence of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>· and·OH in the UV/PS system was an important factor for the inactivation of MS2 phages. Finally, ·OH contributed more to MS2 phage inactivation than SO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>·.

Title: Virus Removal and Inactivation Mechanisms during Iron Electrocoagulation: Capsid and Genome Damages and Electro-Fenton Reactions.
Abstract: Virus destabilization and inactivation are critical considerations in providing safe drinking water. We demonstrate that iron electrocoagulation simultaneously removed (via sweep flocculation) and inactivated a non-enveloped virus surrogate (MS2 bacteriophage) under slightly acidic conditions, resulting in highly effective virus control (e.g., 5-logs at 20 mg Fe/L and pH 6.4 in 30 min). Electrocoagulation simultaneously generated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and Fe(II) that can potentially trigger electro-Fenton reactions to produce reactive oxygen species such as <sup>•</sup>OH and high valent oxoiron(IV) that are capable of inactivating viruses. To date, viral attenuation during water treatment has been largely probed by evaluating infective virions (as plaque forming units) or genomic damage (via the quantitative polymerase chain reaction). In addition to these existing means of assessing virus attenuation, a novel technique of correlating transmission electron micrographs of electrocoagulated MS2 with their computationally altered three-dimensional electron density maps was developed to provide direct visual evidence of capsid morphological damages during electrocoagulation. The majority of coliphages lost at least 10-60% of the capsid protein missing a minimum of one of the 5-fold and two of 3- and 2-fold regions upon electrocoagulation, revealing substantial localized capsid deformation. Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed potential oxidation of viral coat proteins and modification of their secondary structures that were attributed to reactive oxygen species. Iron electrocoagulation simultaneously disinfects and coagulates non-enveloped viruses (unlike conventional coagulation), adding to the robustness of multiple barriers necessary for public health protection and appears to be a promising technology for small-scale distributed water treatment.

Rating: ChatCompletionMessage(content='This abstract is highly informative on the use of iron electrocoagulation for the removal and inactivation of the MS2 bacteriophage, which is a model for non-enveloped viruses.

Title: Pool water disinfection by ozone-bromine treatment: Assessing the disinfectant efficacy and the occurrence and in vitro toxicity of brominated disinfection by-products.
Abstract: Pool water is continuously circulated and reused after an extensive treatment including disinfection by chlorination, ozonation or UV treatment. In Germany, these methods are regulated by DIN standard 19643. Recently, the DIN standard has been extended by a new disinfection method using hypobromous acid as disinfectant formed by introducing ozone into water with naturally or artificially high bromide content during water treatment. In this study, we tested the disinfection efficacy of the ozone-bromine treatment in comparison to hypochlorous acid in a flow-through test rig using the bacterial indicator strains Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus and the viral indicators phage MS2 and phage PRD1. Furthermore, the formation of disinfection by-products and their potential toxic effects were investigated in eight pool water samples using different disinfection methods including the ozone-bromine treatment. Our results show that the efficacy of hypobromous acid, depending on its concentration and the tested organism, is comparable to that of hypochlorous acid. Hypobromous acid was effective against five of six tested indicator organisms. However, using Pseudomonas aeruginosa and drinking water as test water, both tested disinfectants (0.6 mg L<sup>-1</sup> as Cl<sub>2</sub> hypobromous acid as well as 0.3 mg L<sup>-1</sup> as Cl<sub>2</sub> hypochlorous acid) did not achieve a reduction of four log<sub>10</sub> levels within 30 s, as required by DIN 19643. The formation of brominated disinfection by-products depends primarily on the bromide concentration of the filling water, with the treatment method having a smaller effect. The eight pool water samples did not show critical values in vitro for acute cytotoxicity or genotoxicity in the applied assays. In real pool water samples, the acute toxicological potential was not higher than for conventional disinfection methods. However, for a final assessment of toxicity, all single substance toxicities of known DBPs present in pool water treated by the ozone-bromine treatment have to be analyzed additionally.

Title: Transfer Rate of Enveloped and Nonenveloped Viruses between Fingerpads and Surfaces.
Abstract: Fomites can represent a reservoir for pathogens, which may be subsequently transferred from surfaces to skin. In this study, we aim to understand how different factors (including virus type, surface type, time since last hand wash, and direction of transfer) affect virus transfer rates, defined as the fraction of virus transferred, between fingerpads and fomites. To determine this, 360 transfer events were performed with 20 volunteers using Phi6 (a surrogate for enveloped viruses), MS2 (a surrogate for nonenveloped viruses), and three clean surfaces (stainless steel, painted wood, and plastic). Considering all transfer events (all surfaces and both transfer directions combined), the mean transfer rates of Phi6 and MS2 were 0.17 and 0.26, respectively. Transfer of MS2 was significantly higher than that of Phi6 (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Surface type was a significant factor that affected the transfer rate of Phi6: Phi6 is more easily transferred to and from stainless steel and plastic than to and from painted wood. Direction of transfer was a significant factor affecting MS2 transfer rates: MS2 is more easily transferred from surfaces to fingerpads than from fingerpads to surfaces. Data from these virus transfer events, and subsequent transfer rate distributions, provide information that can be used to refine quantitative microbial risk assessments. This study provides a large-scale data set of transfer events with a surrogate for enveloped viruses, which extends the reach of the study to the role of fomites in the transmission of human enveloped viruses like influenza and SARS-CoV-2. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> This study created a large-scale data set for the transfer of enveloped viruses between skin and surfaces. The data set produced by this study provides information on modeling the distribution of enveloped and nonenveloped virus transfer rates, which can aid in the implementation of risk assessment models in the future. Additionally, enveloped and nonenveloped viruses were applied to experimental surfaces in an equivalent matrix to avoid matrix effects, so results between different viral species can be directly compared without confounding effects of different matrices. Our results indicating how virus type, surface type, time since last hand wash, and direction of transfer affect virus transfer rates can be used in decision-making processes to lower the risk of viral infection from transmission through fomites.

Title: UVC inactivation of MS2-phage in drinking water - Modelling and field testing.
Abstract: UVC disinfection has been recognised by the WHO as an effective disinfection treatment to provide decentralized potable water. Under real conditions there are still unknowns that limit this application including the influence of suspended solids and natural organic matter. This work aims to investigate the influence of two key parameters, suspended solids and natural organic matter, on the efficiency of UVC disinfection of surface water to achieve the drinking water quality requirements established by the WHO for point of use (POU) technologies. Kaolinite (turbidity agent) and humic acids (HA, model of organic matter) were used in a factorial design of experiments (Turbidity from 0 to 5 NTU, and HA from 0 to 3.5 mg/L) to investigate their effect on UVC inactivation of MS2 phage in surface water. A collimated beam (12 W) and a commercial UVC disinfection flow system (16 W) designed to provide drinking water at households were used. The UVC flow system both in the laboratory and in the field was able to achieve the reduction requirements established by WHO (LRV >3.5 for all tested conditions), confirming the good performance of the studied UVC disinfection system. The results found in the lab were used to establish a numerical model that predicts the disinfection rate constant as a function of water turbidity and transmittance at 254 nm (confidence level>95%). The model permitted to elucidate the critical effect of low concentrations of HA in reducing the inactivation rate by 40% for 3.5 mg/L-HA compared with 0, the non-significant detrimental effect of turbidity lower than 5 NTU, and the lack of synergistic effects between both parameters at these levels. The UVC flow system was also tested in the field, in Tzabalho, Chiapas (Mexico), and Antioquia (Colombia), with spiked MS2 into natural surface water. This investigation opens a potential application to monitor the performance of UVC systems with surface water by monitoring transmittance at 254 nm as a tool to control UVC domestic systems to deliver safe drinking water in a household without the need of expensive and laborious biological monitoring tools.

Title: Miniaturizing Wet Scrubbers for Aerosolized Droplet Capture.
Abstract: Aerosols dispersed and transmitted through the air (e.g., particulate matter pollution and bioaerosols) are ubiquitous and one of the leading causes of adverse health effects and disease transmission. A variety of sampling methods (e.g., filters, cyclones, and impactors) have been developed to assess personal exposures. However, a gap still remains in the accessibility and ease-of-use of these technologies for people without experience or training in collecting airborne samples. Additionally, wet scrubbers (large non-portable industrial systems) utilize liquid sprays to remove aerosols from the air; the goal is to "scrub" (i.e., clean) the exhaust of industrial smokestacks, not collect the aerosols for analysis. Inspired by wet scrubbers, we developed a device fundamentally different from existing portable air samplers by using aerosolized microdroplets to capture aerosols in personal spaces (e.g., homes, offices, and schools). Our aerosol-sampling device is the size of a small teapot, can be operated without specialized training, and features a winding flow path in a supersaturated relative humidity environment, enabling droplet growth. The integrated open mesofluidic channels shuttle coalesced droplets to a collection chamber for subsequent sample analysis. Here, we present the experimental demonstration of aerosol capture in water droplets. An iterative study optimized the non-linear flow manipulating baffles and enabled an 83% retention of the aerosolized microdroplets in the confined volume of our device. As a proof-of-concept for aerosol capture into a liquid medium, 0.5-3 μm model particles were used to evaluate aerosol capture efficiency. Finally, we demonstrate that the device can capture and keep a bioaerosol (bacteriophage MS2) viable for downstream analysis.

Title: Development and evaluation of DEAE silica gel columns for simultaneous concentration of coliphages and rotavirus from natural water samples.
Abstract: Enteric viruses are commonly present in water bodies in regions with poor sanitation. Although the occurrence of these viruses poses a health risk they are difficult to quantify due to their low concentration and they may remain undetected in the absence of adequate preconcentration. The present study reports the synthesis and utilization of DEAE silica gel (DSiG) as an adsorbent for virus concentration. Two coliphages, MS2 and SUSP2, and an enteric virus, rotavirus A (RVA) were chosen for examining the preconcentration efficiency of DSiG columns. Studies conducted at a low flow rate of 5 mL/min yielded good removal of viruses through adsorption. Studies at a higher flow rate of 50 mL/min followed by elution with optimized eluents yielded a high recovery of MS2 and RVA even when they were present at low concentration (0.01 copy/mL). The eluent Na(1.5 M)-Tw(2%)-G3X (glycine 3X broth, 1.5 M NaCl, 2% Tween, pH 10.2) showed maximum elution of RVA and MS2. Optimal SUSP2 recovery was observed on employing an eluent composed of 1.5 M NaCl, 3% Tween, 0.05 M KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> at pH 9.2. Subsequently, both the eluents were successively applied for elution of the adsorbed viruses. This method was applied for virus preconcentration from lake water in the monsoon and winter seasons. The DSiG column could achieve adequate preconcentration for all the three viruses, i.e., SUSP2, MS2, and RVA, even when they were present at very low concentration and the recovery achieved was comparable to that achieved with ultracentrifugation while the processing time required for handling large volumes of water was considerably lower.

Title: Aerobic Conditions and Endogenous Reactive Oxygen Species Reduce the Production of Infectious MS2 Phage by <i>Escherichia coli</i>.
Abstract: Most of the defective/non-infectious enteric phages and viruses that end up in wastewater originate in human feces. Some of the causes of this high level of inactivity at the host stage are unknown. There is a significant gap between how enteric phages are environmentally transmitted and how we might design molecular tools that would only detect infectious ones. Thus, there is a need to explain the low proportion of infectious viral particles once replicated. By analyzing lysis plaque content, we were able to confirm that, under aerobic conditions, <i>Escherichia coli</i> produce low numbers of infectious MS2 phages (I) than the total number of phages indicated by the genome copies (G) with an I/G ratio of around 2%. Anaerobic conditions of replication and ROS inhibition increase the I/G ratio to 8 and 25%, respectively. These data cannot only be explained by variations in the total numbers of MS2 phages produced or in the metabolism of <i>E. coli</i>. We therefore suggest that oxidative damage impacts the molecular replication and assembly of MS2 phages.

Title: Understanding the Folding Mediated Assembly of the Bacteriophage MS2 Coat Protein Dimers.
Abstract: The capsids of RNA viruses such as MS2 are great models for studying protein self-assembly because they are made almost entirely of multiple copies of a single coat protein (CP). Although CP is the minimal repeating unit of the capsid, previous studies have shown that CP exists as a homodimer (CP2) even in an acid-disassembled system, indicating that CP2 is an obligate dimer. Here, we investigate the molecular basis of this obligate dimerization using coarse-grained structure-based models and molecular dynamics simulations. We find that, unlike monomeric proteins of similar size, CP populates a single partially folded ensemble whose "foldedness" is sensitive to denaturing conditions. In contrast, CP2 folds similarly to single-domain proteins populating only the folded and the unfolded ensembles, separated by a prominent folding free energy barrier. Several intramonomer contacts form early, but the CP2 folding barrier is crossed only when the intermonomer contacts are made. A dissection of the structure of CP2 through mutant folding simulations shows that the folding barrier arises both from the topology of CP and the interface contacts of CP2. Together, our results show that CP2 is an obligate dimer because of kinetic stability, that is, dimerization induces a folding barrier and that makes it difficult for proteins in the dimer minimum to partially unfold and access the monomeric state without completely unfolding. We discuss the advantages of this obligate dimerization in the context of dimer design and virus stability.

Title: Membrane Distillation Provides a Dual Barrier for Coronavirus and Bacteriophage Removal.
Abstract: The persistence of pathogenic microorganisms in treated wastewater effluent makes disinfection crucial to achieve wastewater reuse. Membrane processes such as ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis (RO) have shown promising results for virus and other contaminant removal from treated wastewater effluents for reuse application. However, RO produces a concentrate stream which contains high concentrations of pathogens and contaminants that often requires treatment and volume reduction before disposal. Membrane distillation (MD) is a treatment process that can reduce RO concentrate volume while augmenting the potable water supply. MD is also a dual barrier approach for virus removal as it operates at a high temperature and permeates only the vapor phase through the membrane interface. The effects of temperature on viable virus concentration and membrane rejection of viruses in MD are investigated in this study using two nonenveloped phages frequently used as enteric virus surrogates (MS2 and PhiX174) and an enveloped pathogenic virus (HCoV-229E). At typical MD operating temperatures (greater than 65 °C), viable concentrations of all three viruses were reduced by thermal inactivation by more than 6-log<sub>10</sub> for MS2 and PhiX174 and more than 3-log<sub>10</sub> for HCoV-229E. Also, membrane rejection was greater than 6-log<sub>10</sub> for MS2 and PhiX174 and greater than 2.5-log<sub>10</sub> for HCoV-229E.

Title: Mixed Bacteriophage MS2-L2 VLPs Elicit Long-Lasting Protective Antibodies against HPV Pseudovirus 51.
Abstract: Three prophylactic vaccines are approved to protect against HPV infections. These vaccines are highly immunogenic. The most recent HPV vaccine, Gardasil-9, protects against HPV types associated with ~90% of cervical cancer (worldwide). Thus, ~10% of HPV-associated cancers are not protected by Gardasil-9. Although this is not a large percentage overall, the HPV types associated with 10% of cervical cancer not protected by the current vaccine are significantly important, especially in HIV/AIDS patients who are infected with multiple HPV types. To broaden the spectrum of protection against HPV infections, we developed mixed MS2-L2 VLPs (MS2-31L2/16L2 VLPs and MS2-consL2 (69-86) VLPs) in a previous study. Immunization with the VLPs neutralized/protected mice against infection with eleven high-risk HPV types associated with ~95% of cervical cancer and against one low-risk HPV type associated with ~36% of genital warts & up to 32% of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Here, we report that the mixed MS2-L2 VLPs can protect mice from three additional HPV types: HPV51, which is associated with ~0.8% of cervical cancer; HPV6, which is associated with up to 60% of genital warts; HPV5, which is associated with skin cancers in patients with epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV). Overall, mixed MS2-L2 VLPs can protect against twelve HPV types associated with ~95.8% of cervical cancers and against two HPV types associated with ~90% of genital warts and >90% recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Additionally, the VLPs protect against one of two HPV types associated with ~90% of HPV-associated skin cancers in patients with EV. More importantly, we observed that mixed MS2-L2 VLPs elicit protective antibodies that last over 9 months. Furthermore, a spray-freeze-dried formulation of the VLPs is stable, immunogenic, and protective at room temperature and 37 °C.

Title: Virus pH-Dependent Interactions with Cationically Modified Cellulose and Their Application in Water Filtration.
Abstract: Norovirus and Rotavirus are among the pathogens causing a large number of disease outbreaks due to contaminated water. These viruses are nanoscale particles that are difficult to remove by common filtration approaches which are based on physical size exclusion, and require adsorption-based filtration methods. This study reports the pH-responsive interactions of viruses with cationic-modified nanocellulose and demonstrates a filter material that adsorbs nanoscale viruses and can be regenerated by changing the solution's pH. The bacteria viruses Qbeta and MS2, with diameters below 30 nm but different surface properties, are used to evaluate the pH-dependency of the interactions and the filtration process. Small angle X-ray scattering, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, and ζ-potential measurements are used to study the interactions and analyze changes in their nanostructure and surface properties of the virus upon adsorption. The virus removal capacity of the cationic cellulose-based aerogel filter is 99.9% for MS2 and 93.6% for Qbeta, at pH = 7.0; and desorption of mostly intact viruses occurs at pH = 3.0. The results contribute to the fundamental understanding of pH-triggered virus-nanocellulose self-assembly and can guide the design of sustainable and environmentally friendly adsorption-based virus filter materials as well as phage and virus-based materials.

Title: Advanced Oxidation Processes for Water and Wastewater Viral Disinfection. A Systematic Review.
Abstract: Water and wastewater virological quality is a significant public health issue. Viral agents include emerging and re-emerging pathogens characterized by extremely small size, and high environmental stability. Since the mainly used conventional disinfection methods are usually not able to achieve complete disinfection of viral and other microbial targets, in real water and wastewater matrices, effective strategies for the treatment, use and reuse of water and the development of next-generation water supply systems are required. The scope of the present systematic review was to summarize research data on the application of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for viral disinfection of water and wastewater. A literature survey was conducted using the electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. This comprehensive research yielded 23 records which met the criteria and were included and discussed in this review. Most of the studies (14/23) used only MS2 bacteriophage as an index virus, while the remaining studies (9/23) used two or more viral targets, including phages (MS2, T4, T7, phiX174, PRD-1, S2, ϕB124-14, ϕcrAssphage) and/or Adenovirus, Aichivirus, Norovirus (I, II, IV), Polyomavirus (JC and BK), Sapovirus, Enterovirus, Coxsackievirus B3, Echovirus, and Pepper mild mottle virus. The vast majority of the studies applied a combination of two or more treatments and the most frequently used process was ultraviolet light-hydrogen peroxide (UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) advanced oxidation. The review is expected to highlight the potential of the AOPs for public health protection from the waterborne viral exposure.

Title: Sunlight Inactivation of Human Norovirus and Bacteriophage MS2 Using a Genome-Wide PCR-Based Approach and Enzyme Pretreatment.
Abstract: Human norovirus (hNoV) is an important etiology of gastrointestinal illness and can be transmitted via ingestion of contaminated water. Currently impractical to culture, hNoV detection is reliant on real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based methods. This approach cannot distinguish between infective and inactivated viruses because intact regions of the RNA genome can amplify even if the damage is present in other regions of the genome or because intact genetic material is not contained within an infectious virion. Herein, we employ a multiple long-amplicon RT-qPCR extrapolation approach to assay genome-wide damage and an enzymatic pretreatment to study the impact of simulated sunlight on the infectivity of hNoV in clear, sensitizer-free water. Using MS2 coliphage as an internal control, the genome-wide damage extrapolation approach, previously successfully applied for UV-254 inactivation, vastly overestimated sunlight inactivation, suggesting key differences in photoinactivation under different spectral conditions. hNoV genomic RNA was more susceptible to simulated sunlight degradation per base compared to MS2 genomic RNA, while enzymatic pretreatment indicated that hNoV experienced more capsid damage than MS2. This work provides practical and mechanistic insight into the endogenous sunlight inactivation of single-stranded RNA bacteriophage MS2, a widely used surrogate, and hNoV GII.4 Sydney, an important health-relevant virus, in clear sensitizer-free water.

Title: Genetically Encoding Ultrastable Virus-like Particles Encapsulating Functional DNA Nanostructures in Living Bacteria.
Abstract: DNA nanotechnology is leading the field of <i>in vitro</i> molecular-scale device engineering, accumulating to a dazzling array of applications. However, while DNA nanostructures' function is robust under <i>in vitro</i> settings, their implementation in real-world conditions requires overcoming their rapid degradation and subsequent loss of function. Viruses are sophisticated supramolecular assemblies, able to protect their nucleic acid content in inhospitable biological environments. Inspired by this natural ability, we engineered <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> technologies, enabling the encapsulation and protection of functional DNA nanostructures inside MS2 bacteriophage virus-like particles (VLPs). We demonstrate the ssDNA-VLPs nanocomposites' (NCs) abilities to encapsulate single-stranded-DNA (ssDNA) in a variety of sizes (200-1500 nucleotides (nt)), sequences, and structures while retaining their functionality. Moreover, by exposing these NCs to hostile biological conditions, such as human blood serum, we exhibit that the VLPs serve as an excellent protective shell. These engineered NCs pose critical properties that are yet unattainable by current fabrication methods.

Title: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by a Multiplex Reverse-Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Coupled with Melting Curves Analysis.
Abstract: Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a method of nucleic acid amplification that is more stable and resistant to DNA amplification inhibitors than conventional PCR. LAMP multiplexing with reverse transcription allows for the single-tube amplification of several RNA fragments, including an internal control sample, which provides the option of controlling all analytical steps. We developed a method of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA detection based on multiplex reverse-transcription LAMP, with single-tube qualitative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and MS2 phage used as a control RNA. The multiplexing is based on the differences in characteristic melting peaks generated during the amplification process. The developed technique detects at least 20 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA per reaction on a background of 12,000 MS2 RNA copies. The total time of analysis does not exceed 40 min. The method validation, performed on 125 clinical samples of patients' nasal swabs, showed a 97.6% concordance rate with the results of real-time (RT)-PCR assays. The developed multiplexed LAMP can be employed as an alternative to PCR in diagnostic practice to save personnel and equipment time.

Title: Surface chemistry-dependent antiviral activity of silver nanoparticles.
Abstract: The toxicity towards viruses of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) has been reported to be dependent on several factors such as particle concentration, size, and shape. Although these factors may indeed contribute to the toxicity of AgNPs, the results presented in this work demonstrate that surface chemistry and especially surface charge is a crucial factor governing their antiviral activity. Here, this work investigated the influence of capping agents representing various surface charges ranging from negative to positive. These AgNPs were capped with citrate, polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) mercaptoacetic acid (MAA) and (branched polyethyleneimine (BPEI). We show that AgNPs exhibited surface charge-dependent toxicity towards MS2 bacteriophages. Among the capping agents under investigation, BPEI capped AgNPs (Ag/BPEI) exhibited the highest reduction of MS2 resulting in ≥6 log<sub>10</sub>-units reductions, followed by 4-5 log<sub>10</sub>-units reductions with PVP and PEG capping's and 3-4 log<sub>10</sub>-units with MAA and citrate cappings. Bare nanoparticles reported a mere 1-2 log<sub>10</sub>-units reduction. Electrostatic interaction between the positively charged BPEI-coating and the negatively charged virus surface played a significant role in bringing the MS2 closer to toxic silver ions (Ag<sup>+</sup>). Further results obtained from TEM showed that Ag/BPEI nanoparticles could directly damage the structure of the MS2 bacteriophages. AgNPs and cationic capping agents' observed synergy can lead to much lower and much more efficient dosing of AgNPs for antiviral applications.

Title: Multivalent nanoparticle-based vaccines protect hamsters against SARS-CoV-2 after a single immunization.
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to wreak havoc as worldwide SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, and death rates climb unabated. Effective vaccines remain the most promising approach to counter SARS-CoV-2. Yet, while promising results are emerging from COVID-19 vaccine trials, the need for multiple doses and the challenges associated with the widespread distribution and administration of vaccines remain concerns. Here, we engineered the coat protein of the MS2 bacteriophage and generated nanoparticles displaying multiple copies of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. The use of these nanoparticles as vaccines generated high neutralizing antibody titers and protected Syrian hamsters from a challenge with SARS-CoV-2 after a single immunization with no infectious virus detected in the lungs. This nanoparticle-based vaccine platform thus provides protection after a single immunization and may be broadly applicable for protecting against SARS-CoV-2 and future pathogens with pandemic potential.

Title: Laboratory Modeling of SARS-CoV-2 Exposure Reduction Through Physically Distanced Seating in Aircraft Cabins Using Bacteriophage Aerosol - November 2020.
Abstract: Aircraft can hold large numbers of persons in close proximity for long periods, which can increase the risk for transmission of infectious disease.* Current CDC guidelines recommend against travel for persons who have not been vaccinated against COVID-19, and a January 2021 CDC order requires masking for all persons while on airplanes.<sup>†</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>§</sup> Research suggests that seating proximity on aircraft is associated with increased risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (1,2). However, studies quantifying the benefit of specific distancing strategies to prevent transmission, such as keeping aircraft cabin middle seats vacant, are limited. Using bacteriophage MS2 virus as a surrogate for airborne SARS-CoV-2, CDC and Kansas State University (KSU) modeled the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 exposure and aircraft seating proximity, including full occupancy and vacant middle seat occupancy scenarios. Compared with exposures in full occupancy scenarios, relative exposure in vacant middle seat scenarios was reduced by 23% to 57% depending upon the modeling approach. A 23% exposure reduction was observed for a single passenger who was in the same row and two seats away from the SARS-COV-2 source, rather than in an adjacent middle seat. When quantifying exposure reduction to a full 120-passenger cabin rather than to a single person, exposure reductions ranging from 35.0% to 39.4% were predicted. A 57% exposure reduction was observed under the vacant middle seat condition in a scenario involving a three-row section that contained a mix of SARS-CoV-2 sources and other passengers. Based on this laboratory model, a vacant middle seat reduces risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2 from nearby passengers. These data suggest that increasing physical distance between passengers and lowering passenger density could help reduce potential COVID-19 exposures during air travel. Physical distancing of airplane passengers, including through policies such as middle seat vacancy, could provide additional reductions in SARS-CoV-2 exposure risk.

Title: Purification of RiboNucleoProtein Particles by MS2-MBP Affinity Chromatography.
Abstract: RiboNucleoProtein particles (RNPs), which are composed of RNAs and proteins, play essential roles in many biological processes. The isolation of these molecular machines is a critical step to better understand their mechanisms of action. In this chapter, we describe the MS2-MBP affinity chromatography used to purify the protein content of the RNPs formed with an RNA of interest in a nuclear extract. Substrate RNAs are furnished with a tag consisting of three stem-loops that provide specific binding sites for the phage MS2 protein.

Title: Attenuation and transport of human enteric viruses and bacteriophage MS2 in alluvial sand and gravel aquifer media-laboratory studies.
Abstract: Potable groundwater contamination by human enteric viruses poses serious health risks. Our understanding of virus subsurface transport has largely depended on studying bacteriophages as surrogates. Few studies have compared the transport behaviour of enteric viruses, especially norovirus, with phage surrogates. We conducted laboratory column experiments to investigate norovirus and bacteriophage MS2 (MS2) filtration in alluvial sand, and rotavirus, adenovirus and MS2 filtration in alluvial gravel aquifer media in 2 mM NaCl (pH 6.6-6.9) with pore velocities of 4.6-5.4 m/day. The data were analysed using colloid filtration theory and HYDRUS-1D 2-site attachment-detachment modelling. Norovirus removal was somewhat lower than MS2 removal in alluvial sand. The removal of rotavirus and adenovirus was markedly greater than MS2 removal in alluvial gravel. These findings concurred with the log<sub>10</sub> reduction values, mass recoveries, attachment efficiencies and irreversible deposition rate constants. The modelling results suggested that the MS2 detachment rates were in the same order of magnitude as norovirus, but they were 1 order of magnitude faster than those of rotavirus and adenovirus. The attachment of viruses and MS2 was largely reversible with faster detachment than attachment rates, favouring free virus transport. These findings highlight the risk associated with continual virus transport through subsurface media if viruses are not inactivated and remobilising previously attached viruses could trigger contamination events. Thus, virus attachment reversibility should be considered in virus transport predictions in subsurface media. Further research is needed to compare surrogates with enteric viruses, especially norovirus, regarding their transport behaviours under different experimental conditions.

Title: Engineering and characterization of gymnosperm sapwood toward enabling the design of water filtration devices.
Abstract: Naturally-occurring membranes in the xylem tissue of gymnosperm sapwood enable its use as an abundantly-available material to construct filters, with potential to facilitate access to safe drinking water in resource-constrained settings. However, the material's behavior as a filter is poorly understood, and challenges such as short shelf life have not been addressed. Here, we characterize the operational attributes of xylem filters and show that the material exhibits a highly non-linear dependence of flow resistance on thickness upon drying, and a tendency for self-blocking. We develop guidelines for the design and fabrication of xylem filters, demonstrate gravity-operated filters with shelf life >2 years, and show that the filters can provide >3 log removal of E. coli, MS-2 phage, and rotavirus from synthetic test waters and coliform bacteria from contaminated spring, tap, and ground waters. Through interviews and workshops in India, we use a user-centric approach to design a prototype filtration device with daily- to weekly-replaceable xylem filters, and uncover indicators of social acceptance of xylem as a natural water filter. Our work enhances the understanding of xylem as a filtration material, and opens opportunities for engineering a diverse range of low-cost, biodegradable xylem-based filtration products on a global scale.

Title: Effectiveness of the Nanosilver/TiO<sub>2</sub>-Chitosan Antiviral Filter on the Removal of Viral Aerosols.
Abstract: <b><i>Background:</i></b> The precaution of airborne transmission of viruses, such as influenza, SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, is essential for reducing infection. In this study, we applied a zero-valent nanosilver/titania-chitosan (nano-Ag<sup>0</sup>/TiO<sub>2</sub>-CS) filter bed, whose broad-spectrum antimicrobial efficacy has been proven previously, for the removal of viral aerosols to minimize the risk of airborne transmission. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> The photochemical deposition method was used to synthesize the nano-Ag<sup>0</sup>/TiO<sub>2</sub>-CS antiviral material. The surface morphology, elemental composition, and microstructure of the nano-Ag<sup>0</sup>/TiO<sub>2</sub>-CS were analyzed by a scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and a transmission electron microscopy, respectively. The MS2 bacteriophages were used as surrogate viral aerosols. The antiviral efficacy of nano-Ag<sup>0</sup>/TiO<sub>2</sub>-CS was evaluated by the MS2 plaque reduction assay (PRA) and filtration experiments. In the filtration experiments, the MS2 aerosols passed through the nano-Ag<sup>0</sup>/TiO<sub>2</sub>-CS filter, and the MS2 aerosol removal efficiency was evaluated by an optical particle counter and culture method. <b><i>Results and Conclusions:</i></b> In the MS2 PRA, 3 g of nano-Ag<sup>0</sup>/TiO<sub>2</sub>-CS inactivated 97% of MS2 bacteriophages in 20 mL liquid culture (2 ± 0.5 × 10<sup>16</sup> PFU/mL) within 2 hours. The removal efficiency of nano-Ag<sup>0</sup>/TiO<sub>2</sub>-CS filter (thickness: 6 cm) for MS2 aerosols reached up to 93%. Over 95% of MS2 bacteriophages on the surface of the nano-Ag<sup>0</sup>/TiO<sub>2</sub>-CS filter were inactivated within 20 minutes. The Wells-Riley model predicted that when the nano-Ag<sup>0</sup>/TiO<sub>2</sub>-CS filter was used in the ventilation system, airborne infection probability would reduce from 99% to 34.6%. The nano-Ag<sup>0</sup>/TiO<sub>2</sub>-CS filter could remain at 50% of its original antiviral efficiency after continuous operation for 1 week, indicating its feasibility for the control of the airborne transmission.

Title: Unravelling the removal mechanisms of bacterial and viral surrogates in aerobic granular sludge systems.
Abstract: The aerobic granular sludge (AGS) process is an effective wastewater treatment technology for organic matter and nutrient removal that has been introduced in the market rapidly. Until now, limited information is available on AGS regarding the removal of bacterial and viral pathogenic organisms present in sewage. This study focussed on determining the relation between reactor operational conditions (plug flow feeding, turbulent aeration and settling) and physical and biological mechanisms on removing two faecal surrogates, Escherichia coli and MS2 bacteriophages. Two AGS laboratory-scale systems were separately fed with influent spiked with 1.0 × 10<sup>6</sup> CFU/100 mL of E. coli and 1.3 × 10<sup>8</sup> PFU/100 mL of MS2 bacteriophages and followed during the different operational phases. The reactors contained only granular sludge and no flocculent sludge. Both systems showed reductions in the liquid phase of 0.3 Log<sub>10</sub> during anaerobic feeding caused by a dilution factor and attachment of the organisms on the granules. Higher removal efficiencies were achieved during aeration, approximately 1 Log<sub>10</sub> for E. coli and 0.6 Log<sub>10</sub> for the MS2 bacteriophages caused mainly by predation. The 18S sequencing analysis revealed high operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of free-living protozoa genera Rhogostoma and Telotrochidium concerning the whole eukaryotic community. Attached ciliates propagated after the addition of the E. coli, an active contribution of the genera Epistylis, Vorticella, and Pseudovorticella was found when the reactor reached stability. In contrast, no significant growth of predators occurred when spiking the system with MS2 bacteriophages, indicating a low contribution of protozoa on the phage removal. Settling did not contribute to the removal of the studied bacterial and viral surrogates.

Title: Overcoming the design, build, test bottleneck for synthesis of nonrepetitive protein-RNA cassettes.
Abstract: We apply an oligo-library and machine learning-approach to characterize the sequence and structural determinants of binding of the phage coat proteins (CPs) of bacteriophages MS2 (MCP), PP7 (PCP), and Qβ (QCP) to RNA. Using the oligo library, we generate thousands of candidate binding sites for each CP, and screen for binding using a high-throughput dose-response Sort-seq assay (iSort-seq). We then apply a neural network to expand this space of binding sites, which allowed us to identify the critical structural and sequence features for binding of each CP. To verify our model and experimental findings, we design several non-repetitive binding site cassettes and validate their functionality in mammalian cells. We find that the binding of each CP to RNA is characterized by a unique space of sequence and structural determinants, thus providing a more complete description of CP-RNA interaction as compared with previous low-throughput findings. Finally, based on the binding spaces we demonstrate a computational tool for the successful design and rapid synthesis of functional non-repetitive binding-site cassettes.

Title: Comparison of faecal indicator and viral pathogen light and dark disinfection mechanisms in wastewater treatment pond mesocosms.
Abstract: This study compared light and dark disinfection of faecal bacteria/viral indicator organisms (E. coli and MS2 (fRNA) bacteriophage) and human viruses (Echovirus and Norovirus) in Wastewater Treatment Pond (WTP) mesocosms. Stirred pond mesocosms were operated in either outdoor sunlight-exposed or laboratory dark conditions in two experiments during the austral summer. To investigate wavelength-dependence of sunlight disinfection, three optical filters were used: (1) polyethylene film (light control: transmitting all solar UV and visible wavelengths), (2) acrylic (removing most UVB <315 nm), and (3) polycarbonate (removing both UVB and UVA <400 nm). To assess different dark disinfection processes WTP effluent was treated before spiking with target microbes, by (a) 0.22 μm filtration to remove all but colloidal particles, (b) 0.22 μm filtration followed by heat treatment to destroy enzymes, and (c) addition of Cytochalasin B to supress protozoan grazing. Microbiological stocks containing E. coli, MS2 phage, Echovirus, and Norovirus were spiked into each mesocosm 10 min before the experiments commenced. The light control exposed to all sunlight wavelengths achieved >5-log E. coli and MS2 phage removal (from ~1.0 × 10<sup>6</sup> to <1 PFU/mL) within 3 h compared with up to 6 h in UV-filtered mesocosms. This result confirms that UVB contributes to inactivation of E. coli and viruses by direct sunlight inactivation. However, the very high attenuation with depth of UVB in WTP water (99% removal in the top 8 cm) suggests that UVB disinfection may be less important than other removal processes averaged over time and full-scale pond depth. Dark removal was appreciably slower than sunlight-mediated inactivation. The dark control typically achieved higher removal of E. coli and viruses than the 0.22 μm filtered (dark) mesocosms. This result suggests that adsorption of E. coli and viruses to WTP particles (e.g., algae and bacteria bio-flocs) is an important mechanism of dark disinfection, while bacteria and virus characteristics (e.g. surface charge) and environmental conditions can influence dark disinfection processes.

Title: Hierarchical Bayesian modeling for predictive environmental microbiology toward a safe use of human excreta: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Abstract: The pathogen concentration in human excreta needs to be managed appropriately, but a predictive approach has yet to be implemented due to a lack of kinetics models for pathogen inactivation that are available under varied environmental conditions. Our goals were to develop inactivation kinetics models of microorganisms applicable under varied environmental conditions of excreta matrices and to identify the appropriate indicators that can be monitored during disinfection processes. We conducted a systematic review targeting previous studies that presented time-course decay of a microorganism and environmental conditions of matrices. Defined as a function of measurable factors including treatment time, pH, temperature, ammonia concentration and moisture content, the kinetic model parameters were statistically estimated using hierarchical Bayesian modeling. The inactivation kinetics models were constructed for Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Enterococcus, Ascaris eggs, bacteriophage MS2, enterobacteria phage phiX174 and adenovirus. The inactivation rates of a microorganism were predicted using the established model. Ascaris eggs were identified as the most tolerant microorganisms, followed by bacteriophage MS2 and Enterococcus. Ammonia concentration, temperature and moisture content were the critical factors for the Ascaris inactivation. Our model predictions coincided with the current WHO guidelines. The developed inactivation kinetics models enable us to predict microbial concentration in excreta matrices under varied environmental conditions, which is essential for microbiological risk management in emerging resource recovery practices from human excreta.

Title: Electron Beam Susceptibility of Enteric Viruses and Surrogate Organisms on Fruit, Seed and Spice Matrices.
Abstract: The objective of this study was to use high-energy electron beam (HEEB) treatments to find surrogate microorganisms for enteric viruses and to use the selected surrogates as proof of concept to investigate low-energy electron beam (LEEB) treatments for enteric virus inactivation at industrial scale on frozen blueberries. Six food matrices inoculated with HAV (hepatitis A virus), MNV S99 (murine norovirus), bacteriophages MS2 and Qβ, and Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores were treated with HEEB at 10 MeV using 4, 8 and 16 kGy doses. G. stearothermophilus spores showed the highest inactivation on all matrices except on raisins, with a dose-dependent effect. HAV reached the maximum measurable log<sub>10</sub> reduction (> 3.2 log<sub>10</sub>) when treated at 16 kGy on raisins. MNV showed the highest resistance of all tested microorganisms, independent of the dose, except on frozen blueberries. On frozen blueberries, freeze-dried raspberries, sesame seeds and black peppercorns, HAV showed a mean inactivation level in between those of MS2 and G. stearothermophilus. Based on this, we selected both surrogate organisms as first approximation to estimate HAV inactivation on frozen blueberries during LEEB treatment at 250 keV using 16 kGy. Reductions of 3.1 and 1.3 log<sub>10</sub> were measured for G. stearothermophilus spores and MS2, respectively, suggesting that a minimum reduction of 1.4 log<sub>10</sub> can be expected for HAV under the same conditions.

Title: Antiviral application of colloidal and immobilized silver nanoparticles.
Abstract: This study explored the application of colloidal and immobilized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) for inactivation of bacteriophages. Coliphages that are commonly used as indicators for enteric viruses, were used in this study. Colloidal AgNPs were synthesized via a chemical reduction approach using sodium borohydride as reducing agent and trisodium citrate as stabilizing agent. AgNP-immobilized glass substrate was prepared by immobilizing AgNPs on amine-functionalized glass substrate by post-immobilization method. The AgNP-immobilized glass substrate was also tested so as to minimize the release of AgNPs in the treated water. The characterization of AgNPs and the AgNP-immobilized glass surface was done using field emission gun-transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Studies conducted with varying concentrations of colloidal AgNPs displayed good antiviral activity for MS2 and T4 bacteriophage. Colloidal AgNPs at a dose of 60 μg ml<sup>-1</sup> could completely inactivate MS2 and T4 bacteriophage within 30 and 50 min with an initial concentration of 10<sup>3</sup> PFU ml<sup>-1</sup>. Contaminated water (100 ml) in an unstirred batch reactor with an initial bacteriophage concentration of 10<sup>3</sup> PFU ml<sup>-1</sup> could be inactivated by the AgNP-immobilized glass substrate (1 cm × 1 cm, containing 3.7 μg cm<sup>-2</sup> silver) suspended centrally in the batch reactor. Complete 3-Log bacteriophage inactivation was achieved within 70 and 80 min for MS2 and T4 bacteriophage, respectively, while the aqueous silver concentration was less than 25 μg l<sup>-1</sup>. This is significantly lower than the recommended standard for silver in drinking water (i.e. 100 μg l<sup>-1</sup>, US EPA). Thus, AgNP-immobilized glass may have good potential for generating virus-free drinking water.

Title: Investigation of F-RNA Bacteriophage as a Tool in Re-Opening Australian Oyster Growing Areas Following Sewage Spills.
Abstract: Oysters contaminated with human enteric viruses from sewage are implicated in foodborne outbreaks globally. Bacteriophages have been identified as potential indicators for these viruses, but have not been used in shellfish management outside of the USA. This study aimed to determine the background levels of F-RNA phage in five Australian oyster growing areas with a history of sewage spills and closures, over an 18-month period. In addition, oysters from five growing areas impacted by adverse sewage events were investigated for F-RNA phage, Escherichia coli, norovirus (NoV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV). F-RNA phage ≤ 60 pfu/100 gm shellfish flesh were found to represent a conservative background level in the surveyed areas. Following two of the five sewage spills, elevated phage levels were observed in most sample sites less than 4 days post spill. By 7 days, most sites from all events had phage < 30 pfu/100 gm. NoV was detected in day 1 and day 6 samples from one event when all phage were ≤ 30 pfu/100 gm. NoV was also detected in a day 3 sample from another event with < 30 phage pfu/100 gm, however, multiple replicate samples had elevated phage levels. The results of this study add evidence on the potential use of F-RNA phage as a tool in early re-opening of oyster harvest areas post sewage spills. However, it also highlights the need to better understand situations where phage testing may be ineffectual, and the importance of sampling at multiple sites and over multiple time points, to effectively capture evidence of contamination.

Title: Coliphages as Indicators for the Microbial Quality of Treated Wastewater Effluents.
Abstract: Wastewater effluents are a reliable water source for non-potable water reuse including unrestricted crop irrigation in arid regions suffering from water scarcity. This study was performed to develop and optimize a procedure to concentrate coliphages from 100 L of treated effluent. Moreover, the reduction of coliphages by filtration and disinfection by either chlorine or UV was compared with that of fecal coliform (FC). The adsorption efficiency of MS2 and Qβ coliphages by the NanoCeram filter was similar and reached 99.8%. Elution efficiency of MS2 coliphage from the NanoCeram filters by a solution of 1% NaPP and 0.05 M glycine, pH 9.5, was 74  ±  9.5%. The highest reconcentration efficiency of MS2 and Qβ coliphages was obtained with polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation and reached 76  ±  28% and 90  ±  11%, respectively. In comparison, the reconcentration efficiency of organic flocculation was 0% and 1.3% for Qβ and MS2 coliphages, respectively. The overall recovery efficiency of MS2 coliphages from 100 L tertiary effluent was 57  ±  1.5%. Poor reduction was observed for coliphages compared to FC by filtration and chlorine disinfection although; the reduction of FC, as measured by cultivation, was satisfactory and within the guidelines for unrestricted irrigation. High correlation between the reduction of FC and coliphages was recorded for tertiary effluent disinfected by UV irradiation. Monitoring the microbial quality of tertiary effluent using qPCR for the enumeration of FC was found unsuitable, because DNA levels were unaffected by the treatment processes. The results of this study demonstrated that monitoring the microbial quality of tertiary effluent by FC may not reflect the health risks encountered by the application of these effluents and the addition of coliphages to the monitoring programs may allow for accurate assessment of the health risks introduced by the application of tertiary effluent.

Title: Long-term and stable antimicrobial properties of immobilized Ni/TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocomposites against Escherichia coli, Legionella thermalis, and MS2 bacteriophage.
Abstract: Nickel has been extensively used as a high work function metal because of its abundance, low cost, relatively non-toxic nature, and environmentally benign characteristics. However, it has rarely been extended in a form of immobilized composite, which is a practical strategy applicable for photocatalytic antimicrobial activities. In this study, a composite of nickel and TiO<sub>2</sub> (Ni/TiO<sub>2</sub>) was prepared using a photodeposition method, and its antibacterial properties were investigated using Escherichia coli (E. coli). To optimize Ni/TiO<sub>2</sub> synthesis, the effect of various photodeposition conditions on antibacterial performance were investigated, such as the light irradiation time, metal content, TiO<sub>2</sub> crystalline structure, and presence or absence of electron donors (i.e., methanol). The optimized 2 wt% Ni/TiO<sub>2</sub> exhibited an antibacterial efficiency of 3.74 log within 7 min, which is more than 10-fold higher than that of pristine TiO<sub>2</sub> (2.54 log). Based on this optimized weight ratio, Ni/TiO<sub>2</sub> was immobilized on a steel mesh using an electrospray/thermal compression method, and its antibacterial performance was further assessed against E. coli, MS2 bacteriophage virus (MS2 phage), and a common pulmonary pathogen (Legionella thermalis, L. thermalis). Within 70 min, all target microorganisms achieved an inactivation that exceeded 4 log. Furthermore, the long-term stability and sustainable usability of the Ni/TiO<sub>2</sub> mesh were confirmed by performing more than 50 antibacterial evaluation cycles using E. coli. The results of this study facilitate the successful utilization of immobilized Ni/TiO<sub>2</sub> mesh in water disinfection applications.

Title: Survival of the enveloped bacteriophage Phi6 (a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2) in evaporated saliva microdroplets deposited on glass surfaces.
Abstract: Survival of respiratory viral pathogens in expelled saliva microdroplets is central to their transmission, yet the factors that determine survival in such microdroplets are not well understood. Here we combine microscopy imaging with virus viability assays to study survival of three bacteriophages suggested as good models for respiratory pathogens: the enveloped Phi6 (a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2), and the non-enveloped PhiX174 and MS2. We measured virus viability in human saliva microdroplets, SM buffer, and water following deposition on glass surfaces at various relative humidities (RH). Saliva and water microdroplets dried out rapidly, within minutes, at all tested RH levels (23%, 43%, 57%, and 78%), while SM microdroplets remained hydrated at RH ≥ 57%. Generally, the survival of all three viruses in dry saliva microdroplets was significantly greater than those in SM buffer and water under all RH (except PhiX174 in water under 57% RH survived the best among 3 media). Thus, atmosphere RH and microdroplet hydration state are not sufficient to explain virus survival, indicating that the virus-suspended medium, and association with saliva components in particular, likely play a role in virus survival. Uncovering the exact properties and components that make saliva a favorable environment for the survival of viruses, in particular enveloped ones like Phi6, is thus of great importance for reducing transmission of viral respiratory pathogens including SARS-CoV-2.

Title: The inactivation of bacteriophage MS2 by sodium hypochlorite in the presence of particles.
Abstract: The inactivation of bacteriophage MS2 by sodium hypochlorite was investigated to understand the effect of solution chemistry on the disinfection efficacy in the presence of particles. Kaolinite and Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa) were used as the models of inorganic and organic particles to simulate high turbidity and algal cells, respectively, in drinking water sources. In both particle-containing solutions, lower pH, the presence of cations (di-valent Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and natural organic matters (NOM) were regarded as the main factors to influence the aggregation and inactivation of MS2. The results showed that MS2 aggregated in all solutions at pH 3.0, protecting the inner viruses. At pH 7.0, the presence of Na<sup>+</sup> cations (0-200 mmol/L) did not affect the inactivation efficacy of MS2, which always followed the order of particles-free ≈ kaolinite > M. aeruginosa. The inactivation efficacy of MS2 in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> cations followed the order of kaolinite > particles-free > M. aeruginosa at 0-50 mmol/L Ca<sup>2+</sup> cations, while the inactivation efficacy remained almost constant in the range of 100-200 mmol/L Ca<sup>2+</sup> cations. By contrast, kaolinite offered not enough protection to adsorbed MS2, but MS2 aggregation decreased disinfection efficacy at a high concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> cations. Moreover, the presence of humic acid as NOM decreased the inactivation of MS2 more significantly than M. aeruginosa due to the more consumption of free chlorine from humic acids. Therefore, the co-existence of NOM and di-valent Ca<sup>2+</sup> cations are potential challenges for the inactivation of viruses by sodium hypochlorite in safe drinking water.

Title: Survival of MS2 and Φ6 viruses in droplets as a function of relative humidity, pH, and salt, protein, and surfactant concentrations.
Abstract: The survival of viruses in droplets is known to depend on droplets' chemical composition, which may vary in respiratory fluid between individuals and over the course of disease. This relationship is also important for understanding the persistence of viruses in droplets generated from wastewater, freshwater, and seawater. We investigated the effects of salt (0, 1, and 35 g/L), protein (0, 100, and 1000 μg/mL), surfactant (0, 1, and 10 μg/mL), and droplet pH (4.0, 7.0, and 10.0) on the viability of viruses in 1-μL droplets pipetted onto polystyrene surfaces and exposed to 20%, 50%, and 80% relative humidity (RH) using a culture-based approach. Results showed that viability of MS2, a non-enveloped virus, was generally higher than that of Φ6, an enveloped virus, in droplets after 1 hour. The chemical composition of droplets greatly influenced virus viability. Specifically, the survival of MS2 was similar in droplets at different pH values, but the viability of Φ6 was significantly reduced in acidic and basic droplets compared to neutral ones. The presence of bovine serum albumin protected both MS2 and Φ6 from inactivation in droplets. The effects of sodium chloride and the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate varied by virus type and RH. Meanwhile, RH affected the viability of viruses as shown previously: viability was lowest at intermediate to high RH. The results demonstrate that the viability of viruses is determined by the chemical composition of carrier droplets, especially pH and protein content, and environmental factors. These findings emphasize the importance of understanding the chemical composition of carrier droplets in order to predict the persistence of viruses contained in them.

Title: The Therapeutic Properties of Plants Used Traditionally to Treat Gastrointestinal Disorders on Groote Eylandt, Australia.
Abstract: The First Australians had well-developed healing systems. Groote Eylandt inhabitants used a variety of plant species to treat diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal illnesses. This study was undertaken to test, identify, and evaluate traditional medicines to treat these conditions against gastrointestinal bacterial, protozoal, and viral pathogens, as well as against cancer cell proliferation. Six plant species (<i>Buchanania obovata</i> Engl., <i>Casuarina equisetifolia</i> L., <i>Eucalyptus tetrodonta</i> F. Muell., <i>Planchonia careya</i> (F. Muell.) R. Knuth, <i>Terminalia carpentariae</i> C. T. White, and <i>Vigna vexillata</i> (L.) A. Rich.) were selected from a survey of a panel of elders from the Warnindhilyagwa tribe and compared with the published literature. Decoctions prepared according to traditional methods were screened for growth inhibitory activity of a panel of diarrhoea-causing bacterial pathogens by disc diffusion and liquid dilution MIC assays. Inhibitory activity against the gastrointestinal protozoal parasite <i>Giardia duodenalis</i> and antiproliferative activity against human colorectal (Caco2) and cervical (HeLa) cancer cell lines were evaluated using MTS-based colorimetric cell proliferation assays. Preliminary antiviral screening was accomplished using an MS2 bacteriophage plaque reduction assay. Toxicity was evaluated using <i>Artemia franciscana</i> nauplii mortality and HDF cell viability bioassays. All traditional medicines tested inhibited bacterial growth, often with MIC values substantially <1000 <i>μ</i>g/mL. <i>T. carpentariae</i> was particularly noteworthy, with MIC values of 230-350 <i>μ</i>g/mL against <i>Citrobacter freundii</i>, <i>Salmonella newport</i>, <i>Shigella sonnei</i>, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, and <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis</i>. This species also had MICs 450-950 <i>μ</i>g/mL against all other bacterial pathogens. <i>B. obovata</i> Engl. and <i>E. tetrodonta</i> were also good inhibitors of bacterial growth, albeit with substantially higher MIC values than determined for <i>T. carpentariae.</i> The <i>T. carpentariae</i> decoction was also the best inhibitor of MS2 phage replication (IC<sub>50</sub> = 427 <i>μ</i>g/mL) and Caco2 and HeLa proliferation (IC<sub>50</sub> values of 885 and 85 <i>μ</i>g/mL, respectively). None of the extracts were particularly strong inhibitors of <i>Giardia duodenalis</i> growth. All decoctions were nontoxic in the <i>Artemia</i> nauplii and HDF cell viability bioassays, indicating their suitability for therapeutic use.

Title: cDNA-Derived RNA Phage Assembly Reveals Critical Residues in the Maturation Protein of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa Leviphage PP7.
Abstract: PP7 is a leviphage, with a single-stranded RNA genome, that infects <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> PAO1. A reverse genetic system for PP7 was previously created by using reverse-transcribed cDNA (PP7<sub>O</sub>) from a virion-derived RNA genome. Here, we have found that the PP7<sub>O</sub> cDNA contained 20 nucleotide differences from the PP7 genome sequence deposited in the database. We created another reverse genetic system exploiting chemically synthesized cDNA (PP7<sub>S</sub>) based on the database sequence. Unlike PP7<sub>O</sub>, which yielded infectious PP7 virions, PP7<sub>S</sub>-derived particles were incapable of plaque formation on PAO1 cells, which was restored in the PAO1 cells expressing the maturation protein (MP) from PP7<sub>O</sub> Using this reverse genetic system, we revealed two amino acid residues involved in the known roles of MP (i.e., adsorption and genome replication), fortuitously providing a lesson that the viral RNA genome sequencing needs functional verification, possibly by a reverse genetic system.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The biological significance of RNA phages has been largely ignored, ironically, because few studies have focused on RNA phages. As an initial attempt to properly represent RNA phages in the phageome, we previously created, by using reverse-transcribed cDNA, a reverse genetic system for the small RNA phage PP7, which infects the opportunistic human pathogen <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> We report another system by using chemically synthesized cDNA based on the database genome that has 20 nucleotide differences from the previous cDNA. Investigation of those cDNA-derived phage virions revealed that two amino acids of the maturation protein are crucial for the normal phage lifecycle at different steps. Our study provides insight into the molecular basis for the RNA phage lifecycle and a lesson that the RNA genome sequencing needs to be carefully validated by cDNA-based phage assembly systems.

Title: Applicability of polyethylene glycol precipitation followed by acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from municipal wastewater.
Abstract: The primary concentration and molecular process are critical to implement wastewater-based epidemiology for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, the previously developed methods were optimized for nonenveloped viruses. Few studies evaluated if the methods are applicable to the efficient recovery of enveloped viruses from various types of raw sewage. This study aims (1) to compare the whole process recovery of Pseudomonas phage φ6, a surrogate for enveloped viruses, among combinations of primary concentration [ultrafiltration (UF), electronegative membrane vortex (EMV), and polyethylene glycol precipitation (PEG)] and RNA extraction methods (spin column-based method using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit and acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction using TRIzol reagent) for three types of raw sewage and (2) to test the applicability of the method providing the highest φ6 recovery to the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Among the tested combinations, PEG+TRIzol provided the highest φ6 recovery ratio of 29.8% to 49.8% (geometric mean). UF + QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit provided the second highest φ6 recovery of 6.4% to 35.8%. The comparable φ6 recovery was observed for UF + TRIzol (13.8-30.0%). PEG + QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit provided only 1.4% to 3.0% of φ6 recovery, while coliphage MS2, a surrogate for nonenveloped viruses, was recovered comparably with PEG + TRIzol. This indicated that the nonenveloped surrogate (MS2) did not necessarily validate the efficient recovery for enveloped viruses. EMV + QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit provided significantly different φ6 recovery (1.6-21%) among the types of raw sewage. Then, the applicability of modified PEG + TRIzol was examined for the raw sewage collected in Tokyo, Japan. Of the 12 grab samples, 4 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 CDC N1 and N3 assay. Consequently, PEG + TRIzol provided the highest φ6 recovery and allowed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from raw sewage.

Title: External Quality Assessment for Molecular Detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Clinical Laboratories.
Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a huge threat to public health. Viral nucleic acid testing is the diagnostic gold standard and can play an important role in the prevention and control of this infection. In this study, bacteriophage MS2 virus-like particles encapsulating specific RNA sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses were prepared by genetic engineering. The assessment panel, consisting of four positive samples with concentrations of 2.8, 3.5, 4.2, and 4.9 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL and five negative samples with other human coronaviruses, was prepared and distributed to evaluate the accuracy of routine viral RNA detection. Results of 931 panels from 844 laboratories were collected. The overall percentage agreement, positive percentage agreement (PPA), and negative percentage agreement, defined as the percentage of agreement between the correct results and total results submitted for all, positive, and negative samples were 96.8% (8109/8379), 93.9% (3497/3724), and 99.1% (4612/4655), respectively. For samples with concentrations of 4.9 and 4.2 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL, the PPAs were >95%. However, for 3.5 and 2.8 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL, the PPAs were 94.6% (881/931) and 84.9% (790/931), respectively. For all negative samples, the negative percentage agreement values were >95%. Thus, most laboratories can reliably detect SARS-CoV-2. However, further improvement and optimization are required to ensure the accuracy of detection in panel members with lower concentrations of viral RNA.

Title: Humidity and Deposition Solution Play a Critical Role in Virus Inactivation by Heat Treatment of N95 Respirators.
Abstract: Supply shortages of N95 respirators during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have motivated institutions to develop feasible and effective N95 respirator reuse strategies. In particular, heat decontamination is a treatment method that scales well and can be implemented in settings with variable or limited resources. Prior studies using multiple inactivation methods, however, have often focused on a single virus under narrowly defined conditions, making it difficult to develop guiding principles for inactivating emerging or difficult-to-culture viruses. We systematically explored how temperature, humidity, and virus deposition solutions impact the inactivation of viruses deposited and dried on N95 respirator coupons. We exposed four virus surrogates across a range of structures and phylogenies, including two bacteriophages (MS2 and phi6), a mouse coronavirus (murine hepatitis virus [MHV]), and a recombinant human influenza A virus subtype H3N2 (IAV), to heat treatment for 30 min in multiple deposition solutions across several temperatures and relative humidities (RHs). We observed that elevated RH was essential for effective heat inactivation of all four viruses tested. For heat treatments between 72°C and 82°C, RHs greater than 50% resulted in a >6-log<sub>10</sub> inactivation of bacteriophages, and RHs greater than 25% resulted in a >3.5-log<sub>10</sub> inactivation of MHV and IAV. Furthermore, deposition of viruses in host cell culture media greatly enhanced virus inactivation by heat and humidity compared to other deposition solutions, such as phosphate-buffered saline, phosphate-buffered saline with bovine serum albumin, and human saliva. Past and future heat treatment methods must therefore explicitly account for deposition solutions as a factor that will strongly influence observed virus inactivation rates. Overall, our data set can inform the design and validation of effective heat-based decontamination strategies for N95 respirators and other porous surfaces, especially for emerging viruses that may be of immediate and future public health concern.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Shortages of personal protective equipment, including N95 respirators, during the coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have highlighted the need to develop effective decontamination strategies for their reuse. This is particularly important in health care settings for reducing exposure to respiratory viruses, like severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19. Although several treatment methods are available, a widely accessible strategy will be necessary to combat shortages on a global scale. We demonstrate that the combination of heat and humidity inactivates a range of RNA viruses, including both viral pathogens and common viral pathogen surrogates, after deposition on N95 respirators and achieves the necessary virus inactivation detailed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines to validate N95 respirator decontamination technologies.

Title: Single-gene lysis in the metagenomic era.
Abstract: The small lytic phages (Microviridae and Leviviridae), effect bacterial lysis with the product of a single gene. The three well-studied single-gene lysis (Sgl) proteins (E of φX174, A<sub>2</sub> of Qβ, and Lys<sup>M</sup> of phage M) lack direct muralytic activity, and have been shown to function as 'protein antibiotics' by acting as noncompetitive inhibitors of conserved peptidoglycan (PG) biosynthesis enzymes, MurA, MraY, and MurJ respectively. The fourth, protein L of MS2, does not inhibit PG biosynthesis but instead is hypothesized to trigger host autolytic response through an unknown mechanism. Recent advances in meta-omics approaches have led to an explosion in the available genomes of small lytic phages. Of the thousands of new genomes, only one annotated Sgl shared some sequence similarity with a known Sgl (L of MS2), highlighting the diversity in Sgls. The newly available genomic space serves as an untapped resource for discovering novel Sgls.

Title: Modification of Major Contributors Responsible for Latrine Malodor on Exposure to Hypochlorous Acid: The Potential for Simultaneously Impacting Odor and Infection Hazards to Encourage Latrine Use.
Abstract: Open defecation remains a common practice in developing countries and leads to high incidence and prevalence of acute gastroenteritis, which is most often caused by human noroviruses (human NoV). Encouraging the use of toilets and pit latrines is one method of improving sanitation; however, it is often hindered by not only cultural traditions but also from a reluctance to use latrines and toilets due to their odor and impression of uncleanliness. In an effort to establish new means to encourage toilet and latrine use, laboratory experiments tested the ability of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) to modify the malodorous compounds identified in the air in latrines in developing countries (indole, p-cresol, dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS), and butyric acid) and inactivate MS2 bacteriophage, a surrogate for human NoV. After 5 minutes, > 94% of indole, p-cresol, DMDS, and DMTS was modified as determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography in the presence of 100 ppm HOCl. A log<sub>10</sub> reduction value (LRV) greater than 6 was seen for MS2 bacteriophage after 5 minutes of exposure to 100 ppm HOCl in solution. Sensory studies indicated that there was a significant difference (<i>P</i> ≤ 0.05) between the untreated and HOCl-treated samples for all five malodorous compounds tested. The findings suggest that introduction of HOCl into the headspace air could encourage latrine and toilet use. Optimization of HOCl dosing in air to accomplish both odor control and reduction of infectious hazards is worthy of further study.

Title: Expansion and Refinement of Deep Sequence-Coupled Biopanning Technology for Epitope-Specific Antibody Responses in Human Serum.
Abstract: Identifying the specific epitopes targeted by antibodies elicited in response to infectious diseases is important for developing vaccines and diagnostics. However, techniques for broadly exploring the specificity of antibodies in a rapid manner are lacking, limiting our ability to quickly respond to emerging viruses. We previously reported a technology that couples deep sequencing technology with a bacteriophage MS2 virus-like particle (VLP) peptide display platform for identifying pathogen-specific antibody responses. Here, we describe refinements that expand the number of patient samples that can be processed at one time, increasing the utility of this technology for rapidly responding to emerging infectious diseases. We used dengue virus (DENV) as a model system since much is already known about the antibody response. Sera from primary DENV-infected patients (n = 28) were used to pan an MS2 bacteriophage VLP library displaying all possible 10-amino-acid peptides from the DENV polypeptide. Selected VLPs were identified by deep sequencing and further investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We identified previously described immunodominant regions of envelope and nonstructural protein-1, as well as a number of other epitopes. Our refinement of the deep sequence-coupled biopanning technology expands the utility of this approach for rapidly investigating the specificity of antibody responses to infectious diseases.

Title: ssRNA phage penetration triggers detachment of the F-pilus.
Abstract: Although the F-specific ssRNA phage MS2 has long had paradigm status, little is known about penetration of the genomic RNA (gRNA) into the cell. The phage initially binds to the F-pilus using its maturation protein (Mat), and then the Mat-bound gRNA is released from the viral capsid and somehow crosses the bacterial envelope into the cytoplasm. To address the mechanics of this process, we fluorescently labeled the ssRNA phage MS2 to track F-pilus dynamics during infection. We discovered that ssRNA phage infection triggers the release of F-pili from host cells, and that higher multiplicity of infection (MOI) correlates with detachment of longer F-pili. We also report that entry of gRNA into the host cytoplasm requires the F-plasmid-encoded coupling protein, TraD, which is located at the cytoplasmic entrance of the F-encoded type IV secretion system (T4SS). However, TraD is not essential for pilus detachment, indicating that detachment is triggered by an early step of MS2 engagement with the F-pilus or T4SS. We propose a multistep model in which the ssRNA phage binds to the F-pilus and through pilus retraction engages with the distal end of the T4SS channel at the cell surface. Continued pilus retraction pulls the Mat-gRNA complex out of the virion into the T4SS channel, causing a torsional stress that breaks the mature F-pilus at the cell surface. We propose that phage-induced disruptions of F-pilus dynamics provides a selective advantage for infecting phages and thus may be prevalent among the phages specific for retractile pili.

Abstract: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become pandemic since March 11, 2020. Thus, development and integration in clinics of fast and sensitive diagnostic tools are essential. The aim of the study is a development and evaluation of a one-step quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay (COVID-19 Amp) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection with an armored positive control and internal controls constructed from synthetic MS2-phage-based RNA particles. The COVID-19 Amp assay limit of detection was 10<sup>3</sup>  copies/ml, the analytical specificity was 100%. A total of 109 biological samples were examined using COVID-19 Amp and World Health Organization (WHO)-based assay. Discordance in nine samples was observed (negative by the WHO-based assay) and discordant samples were retested as positive according to the results obtained from the Vector-PCRrv-2019-nCoV-RG assay.

Title: Competition between social cheater viruses is driven by mechanistically different cheating strategies.
Abstract: Cheater viruses, also known as defective interfering viruses, cannot replicate on their own yet replicate faster than the wild type upon coinfection. While there is growing interest in using cheaters as antiviral therapeutics, the mechanisms underlying cheating have been rarely explored. During experimental evolution of MS2 phage, we observed the parallel emergence of two independent cheater mutants. The first, a point deletion mutant, lacked polymerase activity but was advantageous in viral packaging. The second synonymous mutant cheater displayed a completely different cheating mechanism, involving an altered RNA structure. Continued evolution revealed the demise of the deletion cheater and rise of the synonymous cheater. A mathematical model inferred that while a single cheater is expected to reach an equilibrium with the wild type, cheater demise arises from antagonistic interactions between coinfecting cheaters. These findings highlight layers of parasitism: viruses parasitizing cells, cheaters parasitizing intact viruses, and cheaters may parasitize other cheaters.

Title: Interaction of the maturation protein of the bacteriophage MS2 and the sex pilus of the Escherichia coli F plasmid.
Abstract: One promising strategy to combat antimicrobial resistance is to use bacteriophages that attach to the sex pili produced by transmissible antimicrobial resistance (AMR) plasmids, infect AMR bacteria and select for loss of the AMR plasmids, prolonging the life of existing antimicrobials. The maturation protein of the bacteriophage MS2 attaches to the pili produced by Incompatibility group F plasmid-containing bacteria. This interaction initiates delivery of the viral genetic material into the bacteria. Using protein-protein docking we constructed a model of the F pilus comprising a trimer of subunits binding to the maturation protein. Interactions between the maturation protein and the F pilus were investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. In silico alanine scanning and in silico single-point mutations were explored, with the longer term aim of increasing the affinity of the maturation protein to other Incompatibility group pili, without reducing the strength of binding to F pilin. We report our computational findings on which residues are required for the maturation protein and F pilin to interact, those which had no effect on the interaction and the mutations which led to a stronger interaction.

Title: Carbon dots for effective photodynamic inactivation of virus.
Abstract: The antiviral function of carbon dots (CDots) with visible light exposure was evaluated, for which the model bacteriophages MS2 as a surrogate of small RNA viruses were used. The results show clearly that the visible light-activated CDots are highly effective in diminishing the infectivity of MS2 in both low and high titer samples to the host <i>E. coli</i> cells, and the antiviral effects are dot concentration- and treatment time-dependent. The action of CDots apparently causes no significant damage to the structural integrity and morphology of the MS2 phage or the breakdown of the capsid proteins, but does result in the protein carbonylation (a commonly used indicator for protein oxidation) and the degradation of viral genomic RNA. Mechanistically the results may be understood in the framework of photodynamic effects that are associated with the unique excited state properties and processes of CDots. Opportunities for potentially broad applications of CDots coupled with visible/natural light in the prevention and control of viral transmission and spread are highlighted and discussed.

Title: Visualizing a viral genome with contrast variation small angle X-ray scattering.
Abstract: Despite the threat to human health posed by some single-stranded RNA viruses, little is understood about their assembly. The goal of this work is to introduce a new tool for watching an RNA genome direct its own packaging and encapsidation by proteins. Contrast variation small-angle X-ray scattering (CV-SAXS) is a powerful tool with the potential to monitor the changing structure of a viral RNA through this assembly process. The proteins, though present, do not contribute to the measured signal. As a first step in assessing the feasibility of viral genome studies, the structure of encapsidated MS2 RNA was exclusively detected with CV-SAXS and compared with a structure derived from asymmetric cryo-EM reconstructions. Additional comparisons with free RNA highlight the significant structural rearrangements induced by capsid proteins and invite the application of time-resolved CV-SAXS to reveal interactions that result in efficient viral assembly.

Title: Cryo-EM reveals infection steps of single-stranded RNA bacteriophages.
Abstract: Single-stranded RNA bacteriophages (ssRNA phages) are small spherical RNA viruses that infect bacteria with retractile pili. The single positive-sense genomic RNA of ssRNA phages, which is protected by a capsid shell, is delivered into the host via the retraction of the host pili. Structures involved in ssRNA phage infection cycle are essential for understanding the underlying mechanisms that can be used to engineer them for therapeutic applications. This review summarizes the recent breakthroughs in high-resolution structural studies of two ssRNA phages, MS2 and Qβ, and their interaction with the host, E. coli, by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). These studies revealed new cryo-EM structures, which provide insights into how MS2 and Qβ package the RNA, lyse E. coli, and adsorb to the receptor F-pili, responsible for conjugation.

Title: Hierarchical natural move Monte Carlo refines flexible RNA structures into cryo-EM densities.
Abstract: Ribonucleic acids (RNAs) play essential roles in living cells. Many of them fold into defined three-dimensional (3D) structures to perform functions. Recent advances in single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have enabled structure determinations of RNA to atomic resolutions. However, most RNA molecules are structurally flexible, limiting the resolution of their structures solved by cryo-EM. In modeling these molecules, several computational methods are limited by the requirement of massive computational resources and/or the low efficiency in exploring large-scale structural variations. Here we use hierarchical natural move Monte Carlo (HNMMC), which takes advantage of collective motions for groups of nucleic acid residues, to refine RNA structures into their cryo-EM maps, preserving atomic details in the models. After validating the method on a simulated density map of tRNA, we applied it to objectively obtain the model of the folding intermediate for the specificity domain of ribonuclease P from <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> and refine a flexible ribosomal RNA (rRNA) expansion segment from the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (<i>Mtb</i>) ribosome in different conformational states. Finally, we used HNMMC to model atomic details and flexibility for two distinct conformations of the complete genomic RNA (gRNA) inside MS2, a single-stranded RNA virus, revealing multiple pathways for its capsid assembly.

Title: A Protocol for Non-biased Identification of RNAs Transferred Between Heterologous Mammalian Cell Types Using RNA Tagging, Cell Sorting, and Sequencing.
Abstract: Intercellular communication is a major hallmark of multicellular organisms and is responsible for coordinating cell and tissue differentiation, immune responses, synaptic transmission, and both paracrine and endocrine signaling, for example. Small molecules, peptides, and proteins have all been studied extensively as mediators of intercellular communication; however, RNAs have also been shown recently to transfer between cells. In mammalian cells, microRNAs, tRNAs, short noncoding RNAs, mRNA fragments, as well as full-length mRNAs have all been shown to transfer between cells either by exosomes or by membrane nanotubes. We have previously described nanotube-mediated cell-cell transfer of specific mRNAs between heterologous mammalian cell types cultured in vitro. Here, we describe a simple method for the unbiased and quantitative identification of the complete range of transferred mRNAs (i.e., the mRNA transferome) in one population of mammalian cells following co-culture with another population. After co-culture, the individual cell populations are sorted by magnetic bead-mediated cell sorting and the transferred RNAs are then identified by downstream analysis methods, such as RNA sequencing. Application of this technique not only allows for determination of the mRNA transferome, but can also reveal changes in the native transcriptome of a cell population after co-culture. This can indicate the effect that co-culture and intercellular transfer of mRNA have upon cell physiology.

Title: In Vivo Imaging of Mobile mRNAs in Plants Using MS2.
Abstract: Multicellular organisms rely on systemic signals to orchestrate diverse developmental and physiological programs. To transmit environmental stimuli that perceived in the leaves, plants recruit many mobile molecules including mobile mRNAs as systemic signals for interorgan communication. The mobile mRNAs provide an efficient and specific remote control system for plants to cope with environmental dynamics. Upon being transcribed in local tissues, mobile mRNAs are selectively targeted to plasmodesmata for cell-to-cell and long-distance translocation. The mRNA labeling system based on the RNA-binding protein MS2 provides a useful tool to investigate intracellular trafficking of mobile mRNAs in plants.

Title: New Generations of MS2 Variants and MCP Fusions to Detect Single mRNAs in Living Eukaryotic Cells.
Abstract: Live imaging of single RNA from birth to death brought important advances in our understanding of the spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression. These studies have provided a comprehensive understanding of RNA metabolism by describing the process step by step. Most of these studies used for live imaging a genetically encoded RNA-tagging system fused to fluorescent proteins. One of the best characterized RNA-tagging systems is derived from the bacteriophage MS2 and it allows single RNA imaging in real-time and live cells. This system has been successfully used to track the different steps of mRNA processing in many living organisms. The recent development of optimized MS2 and MCP variants now allows the labeling of endogenous RNAs and their imaging without modifying their behavior. In this chapter, we discuss the improvements in detecting single mRNAs with different variants of MCP and fluorescent proteins that we tested in yeast and mammalian cells. Moreover, we describe protocols using MS2-MCP systems improved for real-time imaging of single mRNAs and transcription dynamics in S. cerevisiae and mammalian cells, respectively.

Title: Visualization of Transiently Expressed mRNA in Plants Using MS2.
Abstract: RNA transport and localization are evolutionarily conserved processes that allow protein translation to occur at specific subcellular sites and thereby having fundamental roles in the determination of cell fates, embryonic patterning, asymmetric cell division, and cell polarity. In addition to localizing RNA molecules to specific subcellular sites, plants have the ability to exchange RNA molecules between cells through plasmodesmata (PD). Plant RNA viruses hijack the mechanisms of intracellular and intercellular RNA transport to establish localized replication centers within infected cells and then to disseminate their infectious genomes between cells and throughout the plant organism with the help of their movement proteins (MP). In this chapter, we describe the transient expression of the tobacco mosaic virus movement protein (TMV-MP) and the application of the MS2 system for the in vivo labeling of the MP-encoding mRNA. The MS2 method is based on the binding of the bacteriophage coat protein (CP) to its origin of assembly (OAS) in the phage RNA. Thus, to label a specific mRNA in vivo, a tandem repetition of a 19-nucleotide-long stem-loop (SL) sequence derived from the MS2 OAS sequence (MSL) is transcriptionally fused to the RNA under investigation. The RNA is detected by the co-expression of fluorescent protein-tagged MS2 CP (MCP), which binds to each of the MSL elements. In providing a detailed protocol for the in vivo visualization of TMV-MP mRNA tagged with the MS2 system in Nicotiana benthamiana epidermal cells, we describe (1) the specific DNA constructs, (2) Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transfection for their transient expression in plants, and (3) imaging conditions required to obtain high-quality mRNA imaging data.

Title: Sediment re-suspension as a potential mechanism for viral and bacterial contaminants.
Abstract: Pathogenic enteric viruses and bacteria tend to occur in higher concentrations and survive longer in aquatic sediments than suspended in the water column. Re-suspension of these organisms can result in a significant degradation of overlying water quality. Additionally, the re-suspension of microbial pathogens in artificial irrigation canals could endanger the consumption of fresh and ready-to-eat produce. Irrigation water has been implicated in numerous fresh produce outbreaks over the last 30 years. This study aimed to quantify the proportions of bacterial and viral re-suspension from sediment in a recirculating flume with varying velocities. MS2 coliphage and <i>Escherichia coli</i> were found to re-suspend at rates that were not significantly different, despite organism size differences. However, <i>E. coli</i> re-suspension rates from sand and clay were significantly different. This suggests that likely sediment-associated particles were recovered with the organisms attached. Similar re-suspension rates are hypothesized to be due to the dynamics of sediment transport, rather than that of the organisms themselves. This study also indicated that the re-suspension of sediment at very low velocities (e.g., less than 10 cm/s), could impact the microbiological quality of the overlaying water. Results from this study conclude that sediment could be a viable mechanism for irrigation water contamination.

Title: Comparative study on the inactivation of MS2 and M13 bacteriophages using energetic femtosecond lasers.
Abstract: Femtosecond (fs) laser irradiation techniques are emerging tools for inactivating viruses that do not involve ionizing radiation. In this work, the inactivation of two bacteriophages representing protective capsids with different geometric constraints, that is, the near-spherical MS2 (with a diameter of 27 nm) and the filamentous M13 (with a length of 880 nm) is compared using energetic visible and near-infrared fs laser pulses with various energies, pulse durations, and exposure times. Intriguingly, the results show that inactivation using 400 nm lasers is substantially more efficient for MS2 compared to M13. In contrast, using 800 nm lasers, M13 was slightly more efficiently inactivated. For both viruses, the genome was exposed to a harmful environment upon fs-laser irradiation. However, in addition to the protection of the genome, the metastable capsids differ in many properties required for stepwise cell entry that may explain their dissimilar behavior after (partial) disassembly. For MS2, the dominant mechanism of fs-laser inactivation was the aggregation of the viral capsid proteins, whereas aggregation did not affect M13 inactivation, suggesting that the dominant mechanism of M13 inactivation was related to breaking of secondary protein links.

Title: Nanoscale Structural Characterization of Individual Viral Particles Using Atomic Force Microscopy Infrared Spectroscopy (AFM-IR) and Tip-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (TERS).
Abstract: Viruses are infections species that infect a large spectrum of living systems. Although displaying a wide variety of shapes and sizes, they are all composed of nucleic acid encapsulated into a protein capsid. After virions enter the host cell, they replicate to produce multiple copies of themselves. They then lyse the host, releasing virions to infect new cells. The high proliferation rate of viruses is the underlying cause of their fast transmission among living species. Although many viruses are harmless, some of them are responsible for severe diseases such as AIDS, viral hepatitis, and flu. Traditionally, electron microscopy is used to identify and characterize viruses. This approach is time- and labor-consuming, which is problematic upon pandemic proliferation of previously unknown viruses, such as H1N1 and COVID-19. Herein, we demonstrate a novel diagnosis approach for label-free identification and structural characterization of individual viruses that is based on a combination of nanoscale Raman and infrared spectroscopy. Using atomic force microscopy-infrared (AFM-IR) spectroscopy, we were able to probe structural organization of the virions of Herpes Simplex Type 1 viruses and bacteriophage MS2. We also showed that tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) could be used to reveal protein secondary structure and amino acid composition of the virus surface. Our results show that AFM-IR and TERS provide different but complementary information about the structure of complex biological specimens. This structural information can be used for fast and reliable identification of viruses. This nanoscale bimodal imaging approach can be also used to investigate the origin of viral polymorphism and study mechanisms of virion assembly.

Title: Development of a Single Construct System for Site-Directed RNA Editing Using MS2-ADAR.
Abstract: Site-directed RNA editing (SDRE) technologies have great potential for treating genetic diseases caused by point mutations. Our group and other researchers have developed SDRE methods utilizing adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) and guide RNAs recruiting ADARs to target RNAs bearing point mutations. In general, efficient SDRE relies on introducing numerous guide RNAs relative to target genes. However, achieving a large ratio is not possible for gene therapy applications. In order to achieve a realistic ratio, we herein developed a system that can introduce an equal number of genes and guide RNAs into cultured cells using a fusion protein comprising an ADAR fragment and a plasmid vector containing one copy of each gene on a single construct. We transfected the single construct into HEK293T cells and achieved relatively high efficiency (up to 42%). The results demonstrate that efficient SDRE is possible when the copy number is similar for all three factors (target gene, guide RNA, and ADAR enzyme). This method is expected to be capable of highly efficient gene repair <i>in vivo</i>, making it applicable for gene therapy.

Title: Competitive co-adsorption of bacteriophage MS2 and natural organic matter onto multiwalled carbon nanotubes.
Abstract: A leading challenge in drinking water treatment is to remove small-sized viruses from the water in a simple and efficient manner. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) are new generation adsorbents with previously demonstrated potential as filter media to improve virus removal. This study therefore aimed to evaluate the field applicability of MWCNT-filters for virus removal in water containing natural organic matter (NOM) as co-solute to viruses, using batch equilibrium experiments. Contrary to previous studies, our results showed with MS2 bacteriophages single-solute systems that the affinity of MWCNT for MS2 was low, since after 3 h of equilibration only 4 log<sub>10</sub> reduction value (LRV) of MS2 (20 mL at an initial concentration of 10<sup>6</sup> PFU MS2/mL) were reached. Single solute experiments with Suwannee river NOM (SRNOM) performed with environmentally-relevant concentrations showed MWCNT surface saturation at initial SRNOM concentrations between 10 and 15 mgC/L, for water pH between 5.2 and 8.7. These results suggested that at NOM:virus ratios found in natural waters, the NOM would competitively suppress virus adsorption onto MWCNT, even at low NOM concentrations. We confirmed this expectation with SRNOM-MS2 co-solute experiments, which showed an exponential decrease of the MS2 LRV by MWCNT with an increase in the initial SRNOM concentration. More interestingly, we showed that pre-equilibrating MWCNT with a SRNOM solution at a concentration as low as 0.4 mgC/L resulted in a LRV decrease of 3 for MS2, due to the formation of a negatively charged SRNOM adlayer on the MWCNT surface. Complementary batch experiments with natural NOM-containing waters and competition experiments with SRNOM in the presence of CaCl<sub>2</sub> confirmed that the presence of NOM in waters challenges virus removal by MWCNT-filters, irrespective of the concentration and type of NOM and also in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. We therefore conclude that MWCNT-filters produced with commercially available pristine MWCNT cannot be considered as a viable technology for drinking water virus removal.

Title: Microwave-Generated Steam Decontamination of N95 Respirators Utilizing Universally Accessible Materials.
Abstract: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has caused a severe, international shortage of N95 respirators, which are essential to protect health care providers from infection. Given the contemporary limitations of the supply chain, it is imperative to identify effective means of decontaminating, reusing, and thereby conserving N95 respirator stockpiles. To be effective, decontamination must result in sterilization of the N95 respirator without impairment of respirator filtration or user fit. Although numerous methods of N95 decontamination exist, none are universally accessible. In this work, we describe a microwave-generated steam decontamination protocol for N95 respirators for use in health care systems of all sizes, geographies, and means. Using widely available glass containers, mesh from commercial produce bags, a rubber band, and a 1,100-W commercially available microwave, we constructed an effective, standardized, and reproducible means of decontaminating N95 respirators. Employing this methodology against MS2 phage, a highly conservative surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 contamination, we report an average 6-log<sub>10</sub> plaque-forming unit (PFU) (99.9999%) and a minimum 5-log<sub>10</sub> PFU (99.999%) reduction after a single 3-min microwave treatment. Notably, quantified respirator fit and function were preserved, even after 20 sequential cycles of microwave steam decontamination. This method provides a valuable means of effective decontamination and reuse of N95 respirators by frontline providers facing urgent need.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Due to the rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there is an increasing shortage of protective gear necessary to keep health care providers safe from infection. As of 9 April 2020, the CDC reported 9,282 cumulative cases of COVID-19 among U.S. health care workers (CDC COVID-19 Response Team, MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 69:477-481, 2020, https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6915e6). N95 respirators are recommended by the CDC as the ideal method of protection from COVID-19. Although N95 respirators are traditionally single use, the shortages have necessitated the need for reuse. Effective methods of N95 decontamination that do not affect the fit or filtration ability of N95 respirators are essential. Numerous methods of N95 decontamination exist; however, none are universally accessible. In this study, we describe an effective, standardized, and reproducible means of decontaminating N95 respirators using widely available materials. The N95 decontamination method described in this work will provide a valuable resource for hospitals, health care centers, and outpatient practices that are experiencing increasing shortages of N95 respirators due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Title: Structural Organizations of Qβ and MS2 Phages Affect Capsid Protein Modifications by Oxidants Hypochlorous Acid and Peroxynitrite.
Abstract: Pathogenic enteric viruses and bacteriophages such as Qβ and MS2 are transmitted through the fecal-oral route. However, oxidants such as peroxynitrite (ONOOH) and hypochlorous acid (HClO) can prevent new infection by inactivating infectious viruses. Their virucidal effect is well recognized, and yet predicting the effects of oxidants on viruses is currently impossible because the detailed mechanisms of viral inactivation remain unclear. Our data show that ONOOH and HClO cross-linked the capsid proteins and RNA genomes of Qβ and MS2 phages. Consistently, the capsids appeared intact by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) even when 99% of the phages were inactivated by oxidation. Moreover, a precise molecular study of the capsid proteins shows that ONOOH and HClO preferentially targeted capsid protein regions containing the oxidant-sensitive amino acid C, Y, or W. Interestingly, the interaction of these amino acids was a crucial parameter defining whether they would be modified by the addition of O, Cl, or NO<sub>2</sub> or whether it induced the loss of the protein region detected by mass spectrometry, together suggesting potential sites for cross-link formation. Together, these data show that HClO and ONOOH consistently target oxidant-sensitive amino acids regardless of the structural organization of Qβ and MS2, even though the phenotypes change as a function of the interaction with adjacent proteins/RNA. These data also indicate a potential novel mechanism of viral inactivation in which cross-linking may impair infectivity.

Title: Evaluating a transfer gradient assumption in a fomite-mediated microbial transmission model using an experimental and Bayesian approach.
Abstract: Current microbial exposure models assume that microbial exchange follows a concentration gradient during hand-to-surface contacts. Our objectives were to evaluate this assumption using transfer efficiency experiments and to evaluate a model's ability to explain concentration changes using approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) on these experimental data. Experiments were conducted with two phages (MS2, <i>Φ</i>X174) simultaneously to study bidirectional transfer. Concentrations on the fingertip and surface were quantified before and after fingertip-to-surface contacts. Prior distributions for surface and fingertip swabbing efficiencies and transfer efficiency were used to estimate concentrations on the fingertip and surface post contact. To inform posterior distributions, Euclidean distances were calculated for predicted detectable concentrations (log<sub>10</sub> PFU cm<sup>-2</sup>) on the fingertip and surface post contact in comparison with experimental values. To demonstrate the usefulness of posterior distributions in calibrated model applications, posterior transfer efficiencies were used to estimate rotavirus infection risks for a fingertip-to-surface and subsequent fingertip-to-mouth contact. Experimental findings supported the transfer gradient assumption. Through ABC, the model explained concentration changes more consistently when concentrations on the fingertip and surface were similar. Future studies evaluating microbial transfer should consider accounting for differing fingertip-to-surface and surface-to-fingertip transfer efficiencies and extend this work for other microbial types.

Title: Global Sensitivity Analysis of Environmental, Water Quality, Photoreactivity, and Engineering Design Parameters in Sunlight Inactivation of Viruses.
Abstract: Sunlight-mediated inactivation of microorganisms is a low-cost approach to disinfect drinking water and wastewater. The reactions involved are affected by a wide range of factors, and a lack of knowledge about their relative importance makes it challenging to optimize treatment systems. To characterize the relative importance of environmental conditions, photoreactivity, water quality, and engineering design in the sunlight inactivation of viruses, we modeled the inactivation of three-human adenovirus and two bacteriophages-MS2 and phiX174-in surface waters and waste stabilization ponds by integrating solar irradiance and aquatic photochemistry models under uncertainty. Through global sensitivity analyses, we quantitatively apportioned the variability of predicted sunlight inactivation rate constants to different factors. Most variance was associated with the variability in and interactions among time, location, nonpurgeable organic carbon (NPOC) concentration, and pond depth. The photolysis quantum yield of the virus outweighed the seasonal solar motion in the impact on inactivation rates. Further, comparison of simulated sunlight inactivation efficacy in maturation ponds under different design decisions showed that reducing pond depth can increase the log inactivation at the cost of larger land area, but increasing hydraulic retention time by adding ponds in series yielded greater improvements in inactivation.

Title: Efficiency and stability evaluation of Cu<sub>2</sub>O/MWCNTs filters for virus removal from water.
Abstract: Both multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and metal or metal oxides have demonstrated virus removal efficacy in drinking water applications. In this study, MWCNTs were coated with copper(I) oxide (Cu<sub>2</sub>O) using three distinct synthesis procedures (copper ion attachment, copper hydroxide precipitation, and [Cu(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> complex attachment) and virus removal efficacy (using MS2 bacteriophages) was evaluated. All synthesis procedures resulted in the presence of adsorbed, nanosized Cu<sub>2</sub>O particles on the MWCNTs, shown using X-ray diffraction. Further, transmission electron microscopy confirmed uniform copper(I) oxide distribution along the MWCNTs for all three materials. Virus removal efficacy was assessed for all three synthesised composites both before and after material conditioning (filtering for at least 24 h/280 mL/h), and accounting for additional MS2 inactivation in the permeate due to continued copper inactivation from dissolved/desorbed copper in permeate (time-control). Material conditioning influenced virus removal, with the first litres of water containing higher concentrations of copper than the sixth litres of water, suggesting excess or non-bonded copper species dissolve from filters. Higher copper dissolution was observed for water at pH 5 than at pH 7, which decreased with time. Copper dissolution most likely caused an associated decrease in copper adsorbed to MWCNTs in the filters, which may explain the observed lower MS2 removal efficacy after conditioning. Additionally, the time-control study (immediately after filtration as compared to 2 h after filtration) highlighted continued MS2 inactivation in the permeate over time. The obtained results indicate that the synthesis procedure influences virus removal efficacy for MWCNTs coated with copper oxides and that virus removal is likely due to not only virus electrostatic adsorption to the coated MWCNTs, but also through antiviral properties of copper which continues to act in the permeate. In conclusion, it is highly important to revise the methods of testing filter materials for virus removal, as well as procedure for virus concentration evaluation.

Title: Genome organization and interaction with capsid protein in a multipartite RNA virus.
Abstract: We report the asymmetric reconstruction of the single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) content in one of the three otherwise identical virions of a multipartite RNA virus, brome mosaic virus (BMV). We exploit a sample consisting exclusively of particles with the same RNA content-specifically, RNAs 3 and 4-assembled in planta by agrobacterium-mediated transient expression. We find that the interior of the particle is nearly empty, with most of the RNA genome situated at the capsid shell. However, this density is disordered in the sense that the RNA is not associated with any particular structure but rather, with an ensemble of secondary/tertiary structures that interact with the capsid protein. Our results illustrate a fundamental difference between the ssRNA organization in the multipartite BMV viral capsid and the monopartite bacteriophages MS2 and Qβ for which a dominant RNA conformation is found inside the assembled viral capsids, with RNA density conserved even at the center of the particle. This can be understood in the context of the differing demands on their respective lifecycles: BMV must package separately each of several different RNA molecules and has been shown to replicate and package them in isolated, membrane-bound, cytoplasmic complexes, whereas the bacteriophages exploit sequence-specific "packaging signals" throughout the viral RNA to package their monopartite genomes.

Title: Multiwell plates for obtaining a rapid microbial dose-response curve in UV-LED systems.
Abstract: UV light-emitting diodes (UV-LEDs) have emerged as a new technology for water disinfection. Multiwell plates are a common tool in biological research, but they have never been used for UVC/UVB-inactivation experiments of microorganisms. In this study, a novel, rapid and simple UVC/UVB-inactivation assay was developed for a UV-LED system using a multiwell plate setup (96- and 24-well plates). The relative incident irradiance distribution across the exposed area was examined by spectroradiometry and nitrate-nitrite uniformity assay. The two methods showed a good correlation and high distribution factors (>0.89 and >0.94 for 96- and 24-well plates, respectively). In addition, the potential of the new system for determining disinfection efficacy of E. coli and MS2 coliphage by UV-LEDs emitting at central wavelengths of 265 nm and 285 nm was demonstrated. The inactivation rate constants were comparable to those obtained using UV-LED systems with the conventional dish (or beaker) setup, but the multiwell plate method allowed for many more repetitions. The proposed system is an alternative for UV-inactivation dose-response assay, especially when screening assays are desired, since it has the advantage of being fast, comprehensive (with a large number of simultaneous replicates) and easily adapted to various applications as UV-LED based photocatalysis experiments, UV effect on biofilm formation and UV-based AOP degradation experiments.

Title: Inactivation of airborne viruses using a packed bed non-thermal plasma reactor.
Abstract: Outbreaks of airborne infectious diseases such as measles or severe acute respiratory syndrome can cause significant public alarm. Where ventilation systems facilitate disease transmission to humans or animals, there exists a need for control measures that provide effective protection while imposing minimal pressure differential. In the present study, viral aerosols in an airstream were subjected to non-thermal plasma (NTP) exposure within a packed-bed dielectric barrier discharge reactor. Comparisons of plaque assays before and after NTP treatment found exponentially increasing inactivation of aerosolized MS2 phage with increasing applied voltage. At 30 kV and an air flow rate of 170 standard liters per minute, a greater than 2.3 log reduction of infective virus was achieved across the reactor. This reduction represented ~2 log of the MS2 inactivated and ~0.35 log physically removed in the packed bed. Increasing the air flow rate from 170 to 330 liters per minute did not significantly impact virus inactivation effectiveness. Activated carbon-based ozone filters greatly reduced residual ozone, in some cases down to background levels, while adding less than 20 Pa pressure differential to the 45 Pa differential pressure across the packed bed at the flow rate of 170 standard liters per minute.

Title: Ozone efficacy for the control of airborne viruses: Bacteriophage and norovirus models.
Abstract: This study was designed to test the efficacy of an air treatment using ozone and relative humidity (RH) for the inactivation of airborne viruses. Four phages (φX174, PR772, MS2 and φ6) and one eukaryotic virus (murine norovirus MNV-1) were exposed to low ozone concentrations (1.23 ppm for phages and 0.23 ppm for MNV-1) and various levels of RH for 10 to 70 minutes. The inactivation of these viruses was then assessed to determine which of the tested conditions provided the greatest reduction in virus infectivity. An inactivation of at least two orders of magnitude for φX174, MS2 and MNV-1 was achieved with an ozone exposure of 40 minutes at 85% RH. For PR772 and φ6, exposure to the reference condition at 20% RH for 10 minutes yielded the same results. These findings suggest that ozone used at a low concentration is a powerful disinfectant for airborne viruses when combined with a high RH. Air treatment could therefore be implemented inside hospital rooms ventilated naturally.

Title: In Vivo Tethering System to Isolate RNA-Binding Proteins Regulating mRNA Decay in Leishmania.
Abstract: RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play key roles in many aspects of RNA metabolism. In Leishmania, a unicellular eukaryote that favors the posttranscriptional mode of regulation for controlling gene expression levels, the function of RBPs becomes even more critical. However, due largely to limited in vivo approaches available for identifying RBPs in these parasites, there have been no significant advances to our understanding of the role these proteins play in posttranscriptional control through binding to cis-acting elements in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of mRNAs. Here we describe an optimized in vivo RNA tethering approach using the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein combined to immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis to identify RBPs specifically interacting with 3'UTR short interspersed degenerated retroposon elements (SIDERs). Members of the SIDER2 subfamily were shown previously to promote mRNA degradation through a novel mechanism of mRNA decay. Using this modified MS2 tethering approach, we have identified candidate RBPs specifically interacting with SIDER2 elements and contributing to the decay mechanism.

Non-thermal plasmas (NTPs) are electrical discharges comprised of reactive radicals and excited species that inactivate viruses and bacteria. Our previous experiments using a packed bed NTP reactor demonstrated effective inactivation of bacteriophage MS2 as a function of applied voltage and power. The present study examined the effectiveness of the same reactor in inactivating aerosolized PRRSv. A PRRSv solution containing ∼10<sup>5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml of PRRSv VR2332 strain was aerosolized at 3 ml/min by an air-jet nebulizer and introduced into 5 or 12 cfm air flow followed by NTP exposure in the reactor. Twin impingers upstream and downstream of the reactor collected samples of the virus-laden air flow for subsequent TCID<sub>50</sub> assay and qPCR analyses. An optical particle sizer measured upstream and downstream aerosol size distributions, giving estimates of aerosol filtration by the reactor. The results showed that PRRSv was inactivated to a similar degree as MS2 at the same conditions, with the maximum 1.3-log inactivation of PRRSv achieved at 20 kV and 12 cfm air flow rate. The results demonstrate the potential of properly optimized NTPs in controlling PRRSv transmission.

Title: Expansion of known ssRNA phage genomes: From tens to over a thousand.
Abstract: The first sequenced genome was that of the 3569-nucleotide single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) bacteriophage MS2. Despite the recent accumulation of vast amounts of DNA and RNA sequence data, only 12 representative ssRNA phage genome sequences are available from the NCBI Genome database (June 2019). The difficulty in detecting RNA phages in metagenomic datasets raises questions as to their abundance, taxonomic structure, and ecological importance. In this study, we iteratively applied profile hidden Markov models to detect conserved ssRNA phage proteins in 82 publicly available metatranscriptomic datasets generated from activated sludge and aquatic environments. We identified 15,611 nonredundant ssRNA phage sequences, including 1015 near-complete genomes. This expansion in the number of known sequences enabled us to complete a phylogenetic assessment of both sequences identified in this study and known ssRNA phage genomes. Our expansion of these viruses from two environments suggests that they have been overlooked within microbiome studies.

Title: Evaluating the Environmental Persistence and Inactivation of MS2 Bacteriophage and the Presumed Ebola Virus Surrogate Phi6 Using Low Concentration Hydrogen Peroxide Vapor.
Abstract: Ebola virus (EBOV) disease outbreaks, as well as the ability of EBOV to persist in the environment under certain conditions, highlight the need to develop effective decontamination techniques against the virus. We evaluated the efficacy of hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV) to inactivate MS2 and Phi6 bacteriophages, the latter a recommended surrogate for EBOV. The phages were inoculated onto six material types with and without the presence of whole human blood. The inoculated materials were then exposed to either a high or low concentration of HPV for various elapsed times. The phages were also recovered from positive controls at these same elapsed times, to assess environmental persistence and decontamination efficacy. Low concentration hydrogen peroxide vapor (LCHP; 25 ppm) was effective against both phages on all materials without the presence of blood at 2 h. LCHP was ineffective against the phages in the presence of blood, on all materials, even with a 3-day contact time. Higher concentrations of HPV (>400 ppm) with contact times of 24-32 h achieved approximately 2-6 log reduction of the phages in the presence of blood.

Title: Colloidal Transformations in MS2 Virus Particles: Driven by pH, Influenced by Natural Organic Matter.
Abstract: Enteric viruses, such as enterovirus, norovirus, and rotavirus, are among the leading causes of disease outbreaks due to contaminated drinking and recreational water. Viruses are difficult to remove from water through filtration based on physical size exclusion-for example by gravity-driven filters-due to their nanoscale size. To understand virus removal in drinking water treatment systems, the colloidal nanostructure of a model virus, the MS2 bacteriophage, has been investigated in relation to the effect of pH and natural organic matter in water. Dynamic light scattering, small-angle X-ray scattering, and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that the water pH has a major influence on the colloidal structure of the virus: The bacteriophage MS2's structure in water in the range pH = 7.0 to 9.0 was found to be spherical with core-shell-type structure with a total diameter of 27 nm and a core radius of around 8 nm. Reversible transformations from 27 nm particles at pH = 7.0 to micrometer-sized aggregates at pH = 3.0 were observed. In addition, the presence of natural organic matter that simulates the organic components present in surface water was found to enhance repulsion between virus particles, reduce the size of aggregates, and promote disaggregation upon pH increase. These findings allow a better understanding of virus interactions in water and have implications for water treatment using filtration processes and coagulation. The results will further guide the comprehensive design of advanced virus filter materials.

Title: Virus removal by ceramic pot filter disks: Effect of biofilm growth and surface cleaning.
Abstract: Ceramic pot filters are household water treatment and safe storage (HWTS) systems designed to improve the microbial quality of drinking water. They yield high log reduction values (LRVs) for bacterial and protozoan pathogens but provide very little removal of viruses. This study investigated virus removal of ceramic filter discs (CFDs), using feed water with 3 different nutrient levels under extended continuous operation and limited cleaning frequency. The results show that filter use without cleaning resulted in biofilm growth and MS2 LRV values increased with increasing feed water nutrient content. Cleaning the filter surface by scrubbing led to a partial or total loss in improved LRVs, indicating the importance of this biological top layer to the removal of MS2. Overall, the removal capacity of a matured biofilm remained constant, regardless of its age. MS2 LRVs ranged between 0.9 ± 0.2 LRV for low nutrient (LN), 1.6 ± 0.2 LRV for medium nutrient (MN) and 2.4 ± 0.5 LRV for high nutrient (HN) biofilms. Interestingly, a change in feed conditions for the HN filters resulted in an unprecedented high LRV of >4 LRV, which supports further investigation of the mechanistic role of biofilms in virus removal.

Rating: ChatCompletionMessage(content='This abstract provides insight into the removal of the MS2 virus by ceramic pot filters under varying nutrient conditions and cleaning frequencies.

By further investigating the mechanisms at play in virus removal under different conditions, researchers may gain valuable knowledge that could inform strategies for enhancing the effectiveness of MS2 phages in combating multidrug-resistant E. coli.\n\nRating: 7/10', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)

Title: Numerical and experimental studies of water disinfection in UV reactors.
Abstract: Performance of UV reactors for water disinfection is investigated in this paper. Both experimental and numerical studies are performed on base reactor LP24. Enterobacteria phage MS2 is chosen as the challenge microorganism in the experiments. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the effect of different parameters, i.e. flow rate and UV transmission, on the reactor performance. Simulation is carried out based on the commercial software ANSYS FLUENT with user defined functions (UDFs) implemented. The UDF is programmed to calculate UV dose absorbed by different microorganisms along their flow trajectories. The effect with boundary layer mesh and without boundary layer mesh for LP24 is studied. The results show that the inclusion of boundary layer mesh does not have much effect on the reactor performance in terms of reduction equivalent dose (RED). The numerical results agree well with the experimental measurements, hence validating the numerical model. With this achieved, the numerical model is applied to study other scaled reactors: LP12, LP40, LP60 and LP80. Comparisons show that LP40 has the highest RED and log inactivation among all the reactors while LP80 has the lowest RED and log inactivation.

Title: Effect of polymer and glass physicochemical properties on MS2 recovery from food contact surfaces.
Abstract: Viruses are transmissible via their interaction with contact surfaces of food containers or tools. This study evaluated the recoveries of MS2 coliphage, a virus surrogate, from polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE), and glass (borosilicate and soda lime), as influenced by the surface chemistry and topography. MS2 (5-6 logs) in PBS with 1% TSB was inoculated onto each of 9 different surfaces, 24-h cold-incubated, and recovery was quantified by infectivity. The order of MS2 recovery efficiency from smooth surfaces was PP > PE ≥ soda lime glass, which classified into 3 ANOVA groups, p = 0.05. The MS2 recovery ratios of smooth vs. rough surfaces were 1.4-1.5. Atomic force microscopy revealed 21-nm diam pinholes (<28-nm of MS2 size) in the borosilicate glass. The lowest and highest MS2 recoveries among the 9 surfaces were demonstrated by the hole-bearing borosilicate glass (34 ± 8%) and smooth PP (69 ± 14%) respectively. Generally greater MS2 recovery was obtained from smooth PP and PE surfaces compared to glass, but topographic alterations (pinholes or increased roughness) decreased recovery possibly by trapping the viruses.

Title: Next-generation sequencing as a screening tool for foodborne pathogens in fresh produce.
Abstract: Next generation sequencing (NGS) approaches are increasingly applied to tracing microbial contaminants entering the food chain due to NGS' untargeted nature and ability to investigate non-culturable (and/or difficult to culture) organisms while yielding genomic information about the microbiota. So far, a plethora of microbes has been shown to be associated with fresh produce, but few studies have utilised NGS to identify contamination with human pathogens. This study aims to establish the limit of detection (LoD) for Salmonella and phage MS2 (a Norovirus surrogate) contamination of fresh produce employing NGS approaches on the Illumina MiSeq: 16S amplicon-sequencing, and RNA-seq, using ScriptSeq (Illumina) and NEBNext (New England BioLabs) kits. ScriptSeq proved the most sensitive approach; delivering an LoD of 10<sup>4</sup> CFU reaction<sup>-1</sup> (Colony Forming Units) for Salmonella and 10<sup>5</sup> PFU reaction<sup>-1</sup> (Plaque Forming Units) for phage MS2. Use of the NEBNext kit resulted in detection of Salmonella at 10<sup>6</sup> CFU reaction<sup>-1</sup> and phage MS2 at 10<sup>7</sup> PFU reaction<sup>-1</sup>. 16S amplicon-sequencing yielded a similar LoD of 10<sup>5</sup> CFU reaction<sup>-1</sup> for Salmonella but could not detect MS2. The tested NGS methodologies, in combination with bioinformatics approaches applied, proved less sensitive than conventional microbial detection approaches.

Title: Virus inactivation in groundwater in a postglacial lava field in arctic climate.
Abstract: Outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis are often connected to contaminated drinking water. The assessment of the water quality relies on the cultivation of indicator bacteria, and little is known of the fate of viruses in groundwater, especially in arctic regions. In Iceland, the groundwater temperature is between 3 and 6°C. The aim of this study was to determine virus inactivation at low temperature in a groundwater microcosm and in a borehole in a postglacial lava field. Two phage species that are commonly used as surrogates for norovirus were used, MS2 and PhiX174. Dialysis bags were used for the samples, and a device was constructed to hold many samples at a time and protect the samples in the borehole. No significant decrease of infective PhiX174 phages in the borehole or of the MS2 phages in the microcosm was observed. A slightly significant decrease of PhiX174 in the microcosm was noticed, with one log reduction time of 476 days. On the other hand, a significant reduction in MS2 was found in the field test, where the time needed for 90% reduction was 12·5 days. The results showed that an infective virus can exist in groundwater for months or years in arctic regions and a great difference may exist between results from microcosm and field tests. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study reveals that arctic regions are highly sensitive to virus contamination as an infective virus may exist in groundwater for years at low temperature. The results also show that the virus inactivation observed in field tests may differ considerably from the inactivation observed in laboratory microcosms. The results emphasize the importance of large protection zones around drinking water intakes as well as good wastewater treatment so that the likelihood of faecal contamination of groundwater is reduced.

Title: Evaluation of a portable nanopore-based sequencer for detection of viruses in water.
Abstract: The newly emerged nanopore sequencing technology such as MinION™ allows for real-time detection of long DNA/RNA fragments on a portable device, yet few have examined its performance for environmental viromes. Here we seeded one RNA virus bacteriophage MS2 and one DNA virus bacteriophage PhiX174 into 10 L well water at three levels ranging from 1 to 21,100 plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL. Two workflows were established to maximize the number of sequencing reads of RNA and DNA viruses using MinION™. With dead-end ultrafiltration, PEG precipitation, and random amplification, MinION™ was capable of detecting MS2 at 155 PFU/mL and PhiX174 at 1-2 PFU/mL. While the DNA workflow only detected PhiX174, the RNA workflow detected both MS2 and PhiX174. The virus concentration, or relative abundance of viral nucleic acids in total nucleic acids, is critical to the proportion of viral reads in sequencing results. Our findings also highlight the importance of including control samples in sequencing runs for environmental water samples with low virus abundance.

Title: Antiviral effects of Brazilian green and red propolis extracts on Enterovirus surrogates.
Abstract: Propolis is a natural product of bees with biological activities that are mainly associated with bee type and geographic origin. Propolis extract has been proposed with several applications in environmental health. The ethanol extracts have shown good antimicrobial activity. The association of this technique with ultrasound-assisted extraction has been studied to improve the characteristics of the obtained extracts. Thus, the objective of this work is to verify the antiviral action against two strains of bacteriophages of two extracts of Brazilian propolis (green and red) obtained by conventional extraction and ultrasonic extraction. The activities of the propolis red and green extracts were confirmed by the significant ~3 and ~4.5 Log 10 PFU/mL reduction in the concentrations of the MS2 and Av-08 bacteriophages, respectively. It was found that ultrasound-assisted extraction is comparable to the maceration process and demonstrated the best antiviral activities. Brazilian red propolis was more effective than green propolis in viral reduction in all treatments.

Title: Virus-like Particle-Based L2 Vaccines against HPVs: Where Are We Today?
Abstract: Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the most common sexually transmitted infections worldwide. Ninety percent of infected individuals clear the infection within two years; however, in the remaining 10% of infected individuals, the infection(s) persists and ultimately leads to cancers (anogenital cancers and head and neck cancers) and genital warts. Fortunately, three prophylactic vaccines have been approved to protect against HPV infections. The most recent HPV vaccine, Gardasil-9 (a nonavalent vaccine), protects against seven HPV types associated with ~90% of cervical cancer and against two HPV types associated with ~90% genital warts with little cross-protection against non-vaccine HPV types. The current vaccines are based on virus-like particles (VLPs) derived from the major capsid protein, L1. The L1 protein is not conserved among HPV types. The minor capsid protein, L2, on the other hand, is highly conserved among HPV types and has been an alternative target antigen, for over two decades, to develop a broadly protective HPV vaccine. The L2 protein, unlike the L1, cannot form VLPs and as such, it is less immunogenic. This review summarizes current studies aimed at developing HPV L2 vaccines by multivalently displaying L2 peptides on VLPs derived from bacteriophages and eukaryotic viruses. Recent data show that a monovalent HPV L1 VLP as well as bivalent MS2 VLPs displaying HPV L2 peptides (representing amino acids 17-36 and/or consensus amino acids 69-86) elicit robust broadly protective antibodies against diverse HPV types (6/11/16/18/26/31/33/34/35/39/43/44/45/51/52/53/56/58/59/66/68/73) associated with cancers and genital warts. Thus, VLP-based L2 vaccines look promising and may be favorable, in the near future, over current L1-based HPV vaccines and should be explored further.

Title: Determination of Antibody Population Distributions for Virus-Antibody Conjugates by Charge Detection Mass Spectrometry.
Abstract: Virus-like particle (VLP) conjugates are being developed for biomedical applications; however, there is a lack of quantitative analytical methods to measure the extent of conjugation and modification of VLP based therapeutics. Charge detection mass spectrometry (CDMS) can measure mass distributions for large and heterogeneous complexes and is emerging as a valuable tool in the analysis of biologics. In this study, CDMS is used to characterize the stoichiometry and population distribution of antibodies covalently conjugated to the surface of a bacteriophage MS2 VLP. Initial CDMS analysis of the unconjugated MS2 particles suggested that they had packaged a broad distribution of exogenous genomic material. We developed procedures to remove the undesired genomic material from the VLP preparation and observed that, for the samples where the genomic fragments were removed, the antibody coupling reaction efficiency increased by almost a factor of 2. This meant there were (1) fewer VLPs with no antibodies bound, which is an important consideration for the efficacy of a targeted therapeutic and (2) fewer antibodies were wasted during the coupling reaction. CDMS could be employed in a similar manner as a tool to characterize coupling reaction product distributions and precursors and help inform the development of the next generation of conjugate-based therapies.

Title: Nano-Sized Copper (Oxide) on Alumina Granules for Water Filtration: Effect of Copper Oxidation State on Virus Removal Performance.
Abstract: Virus removal can be successfully achieved based on an electrostatic adsorption mechanism. The key requirement for this process is to develop filter materials that can be produced by low-cost technologies and are suitable in large-scale production for real applications. In this study, we report development of spray-dried alumina granules modified with copper (oxide) nanoparticles and critically assess the effect of copper oxidation state on virus removal capacity. Using plate-shaped alumina as a support material resulted in porous structure, which in turn ensured prolonged contact time of contaminated water with the material. Subsequently, copper (oxide) nanoparticles provided a large number of adsorption sites. Flow experiments revealed that copper(I) oxide and metallic copper were the active phases in virus removal and 99.9% of MS2 bacteriophages could be removed. However, almost no virus removal was observed in the presence of copper(II) oxide. Contrasting virus removal characteristics are associated with the different surface charge of copper species, as determined by zeta potential measurements.

Title: Inactivation of indicator organisms on different surfaces after urban floods.
Abstract: The high frequency and intensity of urban floods caused by climate change, urbanisation and infrastructure failures increase public health risks when the flood water contaminated from combined sewer overflows (CSOs) or other sources of faecal contamination remains on urban surfaces. This study contributes to a better understanding of the effects of urban and recreational surfaces on the occurrence of waterborne pathogens. The inactivation of selected indicator organisms was studied under controlled exposure to artificial sunlight for 6 h followed by 18 h in dark conditions. Concrete, asphalt, pavement blocks and glass as control were inoculated with artificial floodwater containing, as indicator organisms, Escherichia coli bacteria, which are common faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) for water quality assessment, Bacillus subtilis spores chosen as surrogates for Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts and Giardia cysts, and bacteriophages MS2 as indicators for viral contamination. On practically all the surfaces in this study, E. coli had the highest inactivation under light conditions followed by MS2 and B. subtilis, except asphalt where MS2 was inactivated faster. The highest inactivation under light conditions was seen with E. coli on a concrete surface (pH 9.6) with an inactivation rate of 1.85 h<sup>-1</sup>. However, the pH of the surfaces (varying between 7.0 and 9.6) did not have any influence on inactivation rates under dark conditions. MS2 bacteriophage had the highest inactivation under light conditions on asphalt with a rate of 1.29 h<sup>-1</sup>. No die-off of B. subtilis spores was observed on any of the surfaces during the experiment, neither in light nor in dark conditions. This study underpins the need to use different indicator organisms to test their inactivation after flooding. It also suggests that given the sunlight conditions, concentration of indicator organisms and type of surface, the fate of waterborne pathogens after a flood could be estimated.

Title: Attenuation of rotavirus, MS2 bacteriophage and biomolecule-modified silica nanoparticles in undisturbed silt loam over gravels dosed with onsite wastewater.
Abstract: Contamination of potable groundwater by pathogenic viruses from on-site wastewater treatment systems (OWTS) poses a serious health risk. This study investigated the attenuation and transport of rotavirus, bacteriophage MS2 and DNA-labelled-glycoprotein-coated silica nanoparticles (DGSnp) in 2 intact cores of silt loam over gravels dosed with wastewater from an OWTS at 3.53 L/day. To simulate a worst-case scenario, experiments were conducted under saturated conditions. The results from 6 experiments demonstrated that the rotavirus and DGSnp reductions were very similar and markedly greater than the MS2 reduction. This was reflected in the peak concentrations, relative mass recoveries, and temporal and spatial reduction rates. For a given log<sub>10</sub> reduction, the estimated soil depth required for MS2 was over twice that required for rotavirus and DGSnp. This is the first study in which DGSnp was used as a rotavirus surrogate in soil under wastewater applications. Consistent with previous studies, DGSnp showed promise at mimicking rotavirus attenuation and transport in porous media. The results suggest DGSnp could be used to assess the attenuation capacity of subsurface media to rotavirus. However, DGSnp is not conservative and will underestimate the setback distances required for rotavirus reductions by 3%. On the other hand, separation distances determined using the rotavirus parameters and criteria but based on MS2 attenuation, can be too conservative in some subsurface media. To determine safe and realistic separation distances, it would be beneficial and complementary to apply both conservative virus surrogate using MS2 bacteriophage and representative but non-conservative new virus surrogates using biomolecule-modified silica nanoparticles.

As many arbovirus infections, including dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV), and chikungunya (CHIKV), have similar signs and symptoms, clinical diagnosis of arbovirus infections is challenging. Therefore, reliable laboratory tests are necessary to improve the clinical management of patients with suspected arbovirus infections. Real-time reverse-transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) is among the more effective methods to distinguish these viruses. The aim of this study was to construct a unique positive external control derived from a unique plasmid using genetic engineering for specific use in RT-qPCR assays to detect Zika, dengue (1-4), and chikungunya. An external control derived from the MS2 bacteriophage was constructed using sequences from arbovirus and human genomes. Laboratories were asked to test the control in the ZDC Biomol kit, a RT-qPCR kit which is able to detect Zika, dengue serotypes 1-4, chikungunya, and an internal human control. RNA extracted from the external control was able to be amplified and detected in RT-qPCR assays for each virus detected by using the ZDC Biomol kit. The external control, samples from viral culture, and infected patient samples display similar amplification using this assay. The pET47b(+)MS2-ZDC vector is a viable expression system for the production of external control viral-like particles (MS2-ZDC). The RNA from the recombinant particles can be easily extracted and can function as a tool to validate all steps of process from the extraction to the amplification of all targets in specific reaction. Thus, the MS2-ZDC particles are laboratory-safe in order to avoid risk for operators, and the phages are effective as positive control for use in the ZDC Biomol kit amplifying all kit targets making them effective for commercial profile.

Title: Direct sequencing of RNA with MinION Nanopore: detecting mutations based on associations.
Abstract: One of the key challenges in the field of genetics is the inference of haplotypes from next generation sequencing data. The MinION Oxford Nanopore sequencer allows sequencing long reads, with the potential of sequencing complete genes, and even complete genomes of viruses, in individual reads. However, MinION suffers from high error rates, rendering the detection of true variants difficult. Here, we propose a new statistical approach named AssociVar, which differentiates between true mutations and sequencing errors from direct RNA/DNA sequencing using MinION. Our strategy relies on the assumption that sequencing errors will be dispersed randomly along sequencing reads, and hence will not be associated with each other, whereas real mutations will display a non-random pattern of association with other mutations. We demonstrate our approach using direct RNA sequencing data from evolved populations of the MS2 bacteriophage, whose small genome makes it ideal for MinION sequencing. AssociVar inferred several mutations in the phage genome, which were corroborated using parallel Illumina sequencing. This allowed us to reconstruct full genome viral haplotypes constituting different strains that were present in the sample. Our approach is applicable to long read sequencing data from any organism for accurate detection of bona fide mutations and inter-strain polymorphisms.

Title: Bacteriophage MS2 displays unreported capsid variability assembling T = 4 and mixed capsids.
Abstract: Bacteriophage MS2 is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus encapsulated in an asymmetric T = 3 pseudo-icosahedral capsid. It infects Escherichia coli through the F-pilus, in which it binds through a maturation protein incorporated into its capsid. Cryogenic electron microscopy has previously shown that its genome is highly ordered within virions, and that it regulates the assembly process of the capsid. In this study, we have assembled recombinant MS2 capsids with non-genomic RNA containing the capsid incorporation sequence, and investigated the structures formed, revealing that T = 3, T = 4 and mixed capsids between these two triangulation numbers are generated, and resolving structures of T = 3 and T = 4 capsids to 4 Å and 6 Å respectively. We conclude that the basic MS2 capsid can form a mix of T = 3 and T = 4 structures, supporting a role for the ordered genome in favouring the formation of functional T = 3 virions.

Title: Reduction of <i>Escherichia Coli</i> Using Metal Plates with the Influenced of Applied Low Current and Physical Barrier of Filter Layers.
Abstract: Although metal contact is known to reduce bacterial growth, the effects of physical barriers and electricity need further investigation. This study examined the bacteria-reducing properties of copper and stainless-steel metal plates with an added electrical current and up to three filter layers on the growth of <i>Escherichia coli</i> (bacteria) and MS2 bacteriophages (virus). When used with a stainless-steel plate, electricity increased bacteria reduction by 39.5 ± 2.30% in comparison with no electricity added, whereas a three-layer physical barrier decreased its efficiency. Copper also reduced the growth of bacteria, by 58.2 ± 8.23%, and the addition of electricity reduced it further (79.5 ± 2.34%). Bacteriophages were also affected by the metal contact. Further experiments showed that MS2 was also reduced by copper, to 82.9 ± 4.5% after 24 h at 37 °C.

Title: 7 Log Virus Removal in a Simple Functionalized Sand Filter.
Abstract: Viral contamination of drinking water due to fecal contamination is difficult to detect and treat effectively, leading to frequent outbreaks worldwide. The purpose of this paper is to report on the molecular mechanism for unprecedented high virus removal from a practical sand filter. Sand filters functionalized using a water extract of <i>Moringa oleifera</i> (MO) seeds, functionalized sand (f-sand) filters, achieved a ∼7 log<sub>10</sub> virus removal. These tests were conducted with MS2 bacteriophage, a recognized surrogate for pathogenic norovirus and rotavirus. We studied the molecular mechanism of this high removal since it can have important implications for sand filtration, the most common water treatment technology worldwide. Our data reveal that the virus removal activity of f-sand is due to the presence of a chitin-binding protein, <i>M. oleifera</i> chitin-binding protein (MoCBP) on f-sand. Standard column experiments were supported by proteomic analysis and molecular docking simulations. Our simulations show that MoCBP binds preferentially to MS2 capsid proteins demonstrating that specific molecular interactions are responsible for enhanced virus removal. In addition, we simplified the process of making f-sand and evinced how it could be regenerated using saline water. At present, no definitive solution exists for the challenge of treating fecally contaminated drinking and irrigation water for viruses without using technologies that demand high energy or chemical consumption. We propose functionalized sand (f-sand) filters as a highly effective, energy-efficient, and practical technology for virus removal applicable to both developing and developed countries.

Rating: ChatCompletionMessage(content='This abstract provides valuable information on how to enhance virus removal using functionalized sand filters, which could be applied to improve water treatment processes for viral contamination, including in cases of fecal contamination.

Title: Measurements of the self-assembly kinetics of individual viral capsids around their RNA genome.
Abstract: Self-assembly is widely used by biological systems to build functional nanostructures, such as the protein capsids of RNA viruses. But because assembly is a collective phenomenon involving many weakly interacting subunits and a broad range of timescales, measurements of the assembly pathways have been elusive. We use interferometric scattering microscopy to measure the assembly kinetics of individual MS2 bacteriophage capsids around MS2 RNA. By recording how many coat proteins bind to each of many individual RNA strands, we find that assembly proceeds by nucleation followed by monotonic growth. Our measurements reveal the assembly pathways in quantitative detail and also show their failure modes. We use these results to critically examine models of the assembly process.

Rating: ChatCompletionMessage(content='This abstract is quite relevant to the goal of using the MS2 phage in phage therapy for multidrug-resistant E. coli, as understanding the assembly kinetics and pathways of the MS2 bacteriophage capsids can help in designing modifications in the lysis protein for therapeutic purposes.

Title: Cell-free expression of RNA encoded genes using MS2 replicase.
Abstract: RNA replicases catalyse transcription and replication of viral RNA genomes. Of particular interest for in vitro studies are phage replicases due to their small number of host factors required for activity and their ability to initiate replication in the absence of any primers. However, the requirements for template recognition by most phage replicases are still only poorly understood. Here, we show that the active replicase of the archetypical RNA phage MS2 can be produced in a recombinant cell-free expression system. We find that the 3' terminal fusion of antisense RNAs with a domain derived from the reverse complement of the wild type MS2 genome generates efficient templates for transcription by the MS2 replicase. The new system enables DNA-independent gene expression both in batch reactions and in microcompartments. Finally, we demonstrate that MS2-based RNA-dependent transcription-translation reactions can be used to control DNA-dependent gene expression by encoding a viral DNA-dependent RNA polymerase on a MS2 RNA template. Our study sheds light on the template requirements of the MS2 replicase and paves the way for new in vitro applications including the design of genetic circuits combining both DNA- and RNA-encoded systems.

Title: Influence of algal organic matter of Microcystis aeruginosa on ferrate decay and MS2 bacteriophage inactivation.
Abstract: Surface water contaminated with algae and with enteric viruses is a global problem. When surface water is used as a drinking water source, it is important to know the influence of algal organic matter on the disinfection of viruses. In this work, we studied the disinfection efficacy of ferrate and the influence of algal organic matter on the disinfection. We determined the MS2 inactivation kinetics by ferrate under three pH conditions (7, 8, and 8.7). The experimental results and pH-dependent calculation suggest that H<sub>2</sub>FeO<sub>4</sub> and HFeO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> are 1935 and 8 times as effective as FeO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> in MS2 inactivation. We also found that intracellular algal organic matter (IAOM) had a stronger effect on MS2 inactivation kinetics than extracellular algal organic matter (EAOM) suggesting that IAOM led to higher consumption of Fe(VI) compared to EAOM. At pH 8.7, while significant consumption of FeO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> by as low as 8 mg C/L of EAOM and 2 mg C/L of IAOM was detected, MS2 inactivation was negatively influenced only when 13 mg C/L of IAOM present. This study showed that it is important to control pH and to determine the concentration of algal organic matter if ferrate is used for disinfection of surface water contaminated with algae.

Title: Development and Evaluation of a Novel Armored RNA Technology Using Bacteriophage Qβ.
Abstract: Foodborne viruses are a global threat to food safety. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most commonly used method to detect viral RNA in food. Armored RNA (AR) prepared using the MS2 phage system is a successful positive control for detecting foodborne viruses and is an important quality control process when using real-time RT-PCR. In this study, we report a novel technology for preparing AR using bacteriophage Qβ and compare its stability with AR prepared using the MS2 phage system for packaging norovirus detection target RNA. AR could be successfully and efficiently produced using the developed bacteriophage Qβ system. Two types of AR-AR-QNoV prepared using the Qβ system and AR-MNoV prepared using the MS2 system-were stored at different temperatures for different durations. After incubating at - 20 °C for 360 days, the copy numbers of AR-QNoV and AR-MNoV decreased by 8.9% and 35.9%, respectively. After incubating at 4 °C for 60 days, the copy numbers of AR-QNoV and AR-MNoV decreased by 12.0% and 38.9%, respectively. After incubating at 45 °C, the copy numbers of AR-QNoV decreased by 71.8% after 5 days, whereas those of AR-MNoV decreased by 92.9% after only 4 days. After 5 days, AR-MNoV could not be detected using real-time RT-PCR. There was a significant difference in copy numbers decrease rate between AR-QNoV and AR-MNoV at three different temperatures (P < 0.05 ). Therefore, AR prepared using the new bacteriophage Qβ system is more stable than the traditional AR, making the developed strategy a good candidate for AR preparation and quality control.

Title: Bacteriophage MS2 As a Tool for Targeted Delivery in Solid Tumor Chemotherapy.
Abstract: Bacteriophage MS2 was employed for targeted delivery of an apoptosis-inducing agent, Tl+, into a tumor tissue. The targeted delivery was ensured by iRGD peptide, a ligand of integrins presumably located on the surface of endotheliocytes of the tumor tissue neovasculature and certain tumor cells. The synthesized peptide was conjugated to MS2 capsid proteins. Tl+ ions from TlNO3 penetrated the phage particles and tightly bound to phage RNA. Peptide-modified MS2 preparations filled with Tl+ caused cell death in two types of cultivated human breast cancer cells and effected necrosis of these tumor xenografts in mice. Neither peptide-conjugated bacteriophage MS2 without Tl+ nor the phage filled with Tl+ but without the peptide or the same phage with the non-conjugated peptide in solution produced such effects. The preparation exhibited no acute toxicity at a therapeutic dose.

Title: A Multiscale Model for the Self-Assembly of Coat Proteins in Bacteriophage MS2.
Abstract: The self-assembly of viral capsids is an essential step to the formation of infectious viruses. Elucidating the kinetic mechanisms of how a capsid or virus-like particle assembles could advance our knowledge about the viral lifecycle, as well as the general principles in self-assembly of biomaterials. However, current understanding of capsid assembly remains incomplete for many viruses due to the fact that the transient intermediates along the assembling pathways are experimentally difficult to be detected. In this paper, we constructed a new multiscale computational framework to simulate the self-assembly of virus-like particles. We applied our method to the coat proteins of bacteriophage MS2 as a specific model system. This virus-like particle of bacteriophage MS2 has a unique feature that its 90 sequence-identical dimers can be classified into two structurally various groups: one is the symmetric CC dimer, and the other is the asymmetric AB dimer. The homotypic interactions between AB dimers result in a 5-fold symmetric contact, while the heterotypic interactions between AB and CC dimers result in 6-fold symmetric contact. We found that the assembly can be described as a physical process of phase transition that is regulated by various factors such as concentration and specific stoichiometry between AB and CC dimers. Our simulations also demonstrate that heterotypic and homotypic interfaces play distinctive roles in modulating the assembling kinetics. The interaction between AB and CC dimers is much more dynamic than that between two AB dimers. We therefore suggest that the alternate growth of viral capsid through the heterotypic dimer interactions dominates the assembling pathways. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first multiscale model to simulate the assembling process of coat proteins in bacteriophage MS2. The generality of this approach opens the door to its further applications in assembly of other viral capsids, virus-like particles, and novel drug delivery systems.

Title: Imaging Single mRNA Molecules in Mammalian Cells Using an Optimized MS2-MCP System.
Abstract: Visualization of single mRNAs in their native cellular environment provides key information to study gene expression regulation. This fundamental biological question triggered the development of the MS2-MCP (MS2-Capsid Protein) system to tag mRNAs and image their life cycle using widefield fluorescence microscopy. The last two decades have evolved toward improving the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the MS2-MCP system. Here, we provide a protocol to use the latest versions, MS2V6 and MS2V7, to tag and visualize mRNAs in mammalian cells in culture. The motivation behind engineering MS2V6 and MS2V7 was to overcome a degradation caveat observed in S. cerevisiae with the previous MS2-MCP systems. While for yeast we recommend the use of MS2V6, we found that for live-cell imaging experiments in mammalian cells, the MS2V7 has improved reporter properties.

Title: Biochar filters as an on-farm treatment to reduce pathogens when irrigating with wastewater-polluted sources.
Abstract: Microbial contamination of vegetables due to irrigation with wastewater-polluted streams is a common problem around most cities in developing countries because wastewater is an available source of water and nutrients but wastewater treatment is often inadequate. On-farm treatment of polluted water is a feasible option to manage microbial risks in a multi-barrier approach. Current evidence indicates good suitability of biochar filters for microbe removal from wastewater using the hydraulic loading rate (HLR) designed for sand filters, but their suitability has not been tested under on-farm conditions. This study evaluated the combined effect of several variables on removal of microbial indicators from diluted wastewater by biochar filtration on-farm and the correlations between removal efficiency and HLR. Columns of biochar with three different effective particle diameters (d<sub>10</sub>) were fed with diluted wastewater at 1x, 6x, and 12x the design HLR and two levels of water salinity (electrical conductivity, EC). Influent and effluent samples were collected from the columns and analyzed for bacteriophages (ɸX174 and MS2), Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Microbe removal decreased with increasing HLR, from 2 to 4 to 1 log<sub>10</sub> for bacteria and from 2 to 0.8 log<sub>10</sub> for viruses, while S. cerevisiae removal was unaffected. Effective particle diameter (d<sub>10</sub>) was the main variable explaining microbe removal at 6x and 12x, while EC had no effect. Correlation analysis showed removal of 2 log<sub>10</sub> bacteria and 1 log<sub>10</sub> virus at 3x HLR. Thus biochar filters on-farm would not remove significant amounts of bacteria and viruses. However, the design HLR was found to be conservative. These results, and some technical and management considerations identified, can assist in the development of a scientific method for designing biochar filters for on-farm and conventional wastewater treatment.

Title: Mechanisms of virus mitigation and suitability of bacteriophages as surrogates in drinking water treatment by iron electrocoagulation.
Abstract: Emerging water treatment technologies using ferrous and zero-valent iron show promising virus mitigation by both inactivation and adsorption. In this study, iron electrocoagulation was investigated for virus mitigation in drinking water via bench-scale batch experiments. Relative contributions of physical removal and inactivation, as determined by recovery via pH 9.5 beef broth elution, were investigated for three mammalian viruses (adenovirus, echovirus, and feline calicivirus) and four bacteriophage surrogates (fr, MS2, P22, and ΦX174). Though no one bacteriophage exactly represented mitigation of the mammalian viruses in all water matrices, bacteriophage ΦX174 was the only surrogate that showed overall removal comparable to that of the mammalian viruses. Bacteriophages fr, MS2, and P22 were all more susceptible to inactivation than the three mammalian viruses, raising concerns about the suitability of these common surrogates as indicators of virus mitigation. To determine why some bacteriophages were particularly susceptible to inactivation, mechanisms of bacteriophage mitigation due to electrocoagulation were investigated. Physical removal was primarily due to inclusion in flocs, while inactivation was primarily due to ferrous iron oxidation. Greater electrostatic attraction, virus aggregation, and capsid durability were proposed as reasons for virus susceptibility to ferrous-based inactivation. Results suggest that overall treatment claims based on bacteriophage mitigation for any iron-based technology should be critically considered due to higher susceptibility of bacteriophages to inactivation via ferrous oxidation.

Title: Mechanisms investigation on bacterial inactivation through combinations of UV wavelengths.
Abstract: Recently, ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (UV-LEDs) have emerged as a new UV source, bringing flexibility for various UV wavelength combinations due to their unique feature of wavelength diversity. In this study, we investigated inactivation mechanisms of representative microorganisms at different wavelength combinations using UV-LEDs. Two types of indicator microorganisms were examined, namely Escherichia coli (E. coli) as a representative bacteria and bacteriophage MS2 as a representative virus. Different inactivation effects were observed, and the results for UVA pretreatment followed by UVC inactivation were particularly interesting. While a substantial shoulder in the E. coli UVC inactivation curve was observed, this was reduced by UVA pretreatment (365 nm) at 17 J/cm<sup>2</sup>. Further, 52 J/cm<sup>2</sup> UVA eliminated the shoulder in the fluence-response curves, resulting in improved UVC (265 nm) inactivation of E. coli by over two orders of magnitude. No inactivation improvement was observed for MS2. Moreover, UVA pretreatment eliminated photoreactivation of E. coli but did not affect dark repair. Detailed investigation of inactivation mechanisms revealed that hydroxyl radicals (•OH) played a significant role in the effects of UVA pretreatment. This study demonstrated that •OH radicals were generated inside E. coli cells during UVA pretreatment, which accounted for the subsequent effects on E. coli. The impact of UVA pretreatment on E. coli inactivation and reactivation was mainly due to increased levels of •OH radicals in E. coli cells, impairing cell functions such as DNA self-repair.

Title: Structural basis for the adsorption of a single-stranded RNA bacteriophage.
Abstract: Single-stranded RNA bacteriophages (ssRNA phages) infect Gram-negative bacteria via a single maturation protein (Mat), which attaches to a retractile pilus of the host. Here we present structures of the ssRNA phage MS2 in complex with the Escherichia coli F-pilus, showing a network of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions at the Mat-pilus interface. Moreover, binding of the pilus induces slight orientational variations of the Mat relative to the rest of the phage capsid, priming the Mat-connected genomic RNA (gRNA) for its release from the virions. The exposed tip of the attached Mat points opposite to the direction of the pilus retraction, which may facilitate the translocation of the gRNA from the capsid into the host cytosol.

Title: Automated Design of Diverse Stand-Alone Riboswitches.
Abstract: Riboswitches that couple binding of ligands to conformational changes offer sensors and control elements for RNA synthetic biology and medical biotechnology. However, design of these riboswitches has required expert intuition or software specialized to transcription or translation outputs; design has been particularly challenging for applications in which the riboswitch output cannot be amplified by other molecular machinery. We present a fully automated design method called RiboLogic for such "stand-alone" riboswitches and test it <i>via</i> high-throughput experiments on 2875 molecules using RNA-MaP (RNA on a massively parallel array) technology. These molecules consistently modulate their affinity to the MS2 bacteriophage coat protein upon binding of flavin mononucleotide, tryptophan, theophylline, and microRNA miR-208a, achieving activation ratios of up to 20 and significantly better performance than control designs. By encompassing a wide diversity of stand-alone switches and highly quantitative data, the resulting <i>ribologic-solves</i> experimental data set provides a rich resource for further improvement of riboswitch models and design methods.

Title: Microbiological Evaluation of 5 L- and 20 L-Transparent Polypropylene Buckets for Solar Water Disinfection (SODIS).
Abstract: Solar water disinfection (SODIS) is an appropriate technology for household treatment of drinking water in low-to-middle-income communities, as it is effective, low cost and easy to use. Nevertheless, uptake is low due partially to the burden of using small volume polyethylene terephthalate bottles (1.5-2 L). A major challenge is to develop a low-cost transparent container for disinfecting larger volumes of water. (2) Methods: This study examines the capability of transparent polypropylene (PP) buckets of 5 L- and 20 L- volume as SODIS containers using three waterborne pathogen indicators: <i>Escherichia coli</i>, MS2-phage and <i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i>. (3) Results: Similar inactivation kinetics were observed under natural sunlight for the inactivation of all three organisms in well water using 5 L- and 20 L-buckets compared to 1.5 L-polyethylene-terephthalate (PET) bottles. The PP materials were exposed to natural and accelerated solar ageing (ISO-16474). UV transmission of the 20 L-buckets remained stable and with physical integrity even after the longest ageing periods (9 months or 900 h of natural or artificial solar UV exposure, respectively). The 5 L-buckets were physically degraded and lost significant UV-transmission, due to the thinner wall compared to the 20 L-bucket. (4) Conclusion: This work demonstrates that the 20 L SODIS bucket technology produces excellent bacterial, viral and protozoan inactivation and is obtained using a simple transparent polypropylene bucket fabricated locally at very low cost ($2.90 USD per unit). The increased bucket volume of 20 L allows for a ten-fold increase in treatment batch volume and can thus more easily provide for the drinking water requirements of most households. The use of buckets in households across low to middle income countries is an already accepted practice.

Title: Sequential electrocoagulation-electrooxidation for virus mitigation in drinking water.
Abstract: Electrochemical water treatment is a promising alternative for small-scale and remote water systems that lack operational capacity or convenient access to reagents for chemical coagulation and disinfection. In this study, the mitigation of viruses was investigated using electrocoagulation as a pretreatment prior to electrooxidation treatment using boron-doped diamond electrodes. This research is the first to investigate a sequential electrocoagulation-electrooxidation treatment system for virus removal. Bench-scale, batch reactors were used to evaluate mitigation of viruses in variable water quality via: a) electrooxidation, and b) a sequential electrocoagulation-electrooxidation treatment train. Electrooxidation of two bacteriophages, MS2 and ΦX174, was inhibited by natural organic matter and turbidity, indicating the probable need for pretreatment. However, the electrocoagulation-electrooxidation treatment train was beneficial only in the model surface waters employed. In model groundwaters, electrocoagulation alone was as good or better than the combined electrocoagulation-electrooxidation treatment train. Reduction of human echovirus was significantly lower than one or both bacteriophages in all model waters, though bacteriophage ΦX174 was a more representative surrogate than MS2 in the presence of natural organic matter and turbidity. Compared to conventional treatment by ferric salt coagulant and free chlorine disinfection, the electrocoagulation-electrooxidation system was less effective in model surface waters but more effective in model groundwaters. Sequential electrocoagulation-electrooxidation was beneficial for some applications, though practical considerations may currently outweigh the benefits.

Title: Development and Evaluation of a One-Step Quantitative RT-PCR Assay for Detection of Lassa Virus.
Abstract: Lassa fever is a severe viral hemorrhagic illness caused by Lassa virus. Based on estimates, the number of LASV infections ranges from 300,000 to 500,000 cases in endemic areas with a fatality rate of 1%. Development of fast and sensitive tools for the control and prevention of Lassa virus infection as well as for clinical diagnostics of Lassa fever are crucial. Here we reported development and evaluation of a one-step quantitative RT-qPCR assay for the Lassa virus detection - LASV-Fl. This assay is suitable for the detection of lineages I-IV of Lassa virus. The limit of detection of the assay ranged from 10<sup>3</sup> copies/ml to 10<sup>5</sup> copies/ml and has 96.4% diagnostic sensitivity, whereas analytical and diagnostic specificities both were 100%. Serum, whole blood and tissue are suitable for use with the assay. The assay contains all the necessary components to perform the analysis, including an armored positive control (ARC+) and an armored internal control (IC). The study was done during the mission of specialized anti-epidemic team of the Russian Federation (SAET) in the Republic of Guinea in 2015-2018.

Title: Ultraviolet inactivation of bacteria and model viruses in coconut water using a collimated beam system.
Abstract: This study investigated the effect of ultraviolet-C irradiation on the inactivation of microorganisms in coconut water, a highly opaque liquid food (1.01 ± 0.018 absorption coefficient). Ultraviolet-C inactivation kinetics of two bacteriophages (MS2, T1UV) and three surrogate bacteria (<i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium, <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>) in 0.1% (w/v) peptone and coconut water were investigated. Ultraviolet-C irradiation at 254 nm was applied to stirred samples, using a collimated beam device. A series of known ultraviolet-C doses (0-40 mJ cm<sup>-2</sup>) were applied for ultraviolet-C treatment except for MS2 where higher doses were delivered (100 mJ cm<sup>-2</sup>). Inactivation levels of all organisms were proportional to ultraviolet-C dose. At the highest dose of 40 mJ cm<sup>-2</sup>, three surrogates of pathogenic bacteria were inactivated by more than 5-log<sub>10</sub> (p < 0.05) in 0.1% (w/v) peptone and coconut water. Results showed that ultraviolet-C irradiation effectively inactivated bacteriophage and surrogate bacteria in highly opaque coconut water. The log reduction kinetics of microorganisms followed log-linear and exponential models with higher R<sup>2</sup> (>0.95) and low root mean square error values. The D<sub>10</sub> values of 3, 5.48, and 4.58 mJ cm<sup>-2</sup> were obtained from the inactivation of <i>E. coli</i>, <i>S.</i> Typhimurium, and <i>L. monocytogenes</i>, respectively. Models for predicting log reduction as a function of ultraviolet-C irradiation dose were found to be significant (p < 0.05). Fluid optics were the key controlling parameters for efficient microbial inactivation. Therefore, the ultraviolet-C dose must be calculated not only from the incident ultraviolet-C intensity but must also consider the attenuation in the samples. The results from this study imply that adequate log reduction of vegetative cells and model viruses is achievable in coconut water and suggested significant potential for ultraviolet-C treatment of other liquid foods.

Title: Bacteriophage MS2 and titanium dioxide heteroaggregation: Effects of ambient light and the presence of quartz sand.
Abstract: Nanoparticles (NPs) are used in numerous applications and have been observed to accumulate in natural water bodies, including aquifers where they can interact with suspended colloids and viruses. This study examines the attachment of bacteriophage MS2 onto titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) anatase NPs using three different MS2 concentrations. Batch experiments, were conducted at room temperature to investigate the effect of ambient light and the presence of quartz sand on MS2 and TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs heteroaggregation. Appropriate attachment isotherms were determined. Extended DLVO (XDLVO) theory was used to quantify the various interaction energy profiles. The results of batch experiments demonstrated that MS2 attachment onto TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs was favored in the presence of sand under ambient light, while under dark conditions no clear trend was observed. Estimated XDLVO interaction energy profiles indicated that hydrophobic interactions may play a major role and influence the aggregation and heteroaggregation of MS2 and TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs, as well as the simultaneous attachment of MS2 and TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs onto quartz sand.

Title: Interaction between functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes and MS2 bacteriophages in water.
Abstract: Fate and transport of carbon nanomaterials can be strongly dependent on the interaction with secondary particulates in the aquatic systems. Bio-particulates in water, e.g., viruses with charged and hydrophobic surface moieties, may profoundly influence the interfacial behavior and hence the environmental fate of nanomaterials (and vice versa). This study systematically evaluates the interfacial interaction of acid-functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) with MS2 bacteriophages, or heteroaggregation behavior of these particulates, under mono- and di-valent cations and with Suwannee River humic acid (SRHA). Results indicate that the highest concentration of MS2 (i.e., MWNT:MS2 of 100:1) renders exceptional stability of MWNTs, even in high salinity conditions. However, at lower MS2 concentrations (i.e., MWNT:MS2 of 1000:1 and 10,000:1), the suppression of MWNT heteroaggregation rate is not as significant. The observed enhanced stability is likely caused by the preferential attachment of the MS2 capsids onto MWNT surfaces, which is mediated by electrostatic attraction (between negatively charged oxygen-containing moieties on MWNTs and positively charged amino acid residues on MS2 surfaces) and/or by MS2 capsids with positive hydropathy index (indicating strong hydrophobicity). Presence of SRHA also shows stability enhancement; however, at lower MS2 concentrations, SRHA dominated the heteroaggregation behavior. These results implicate that preferential interaction between virus capsids (i.e., MS2 and may be other waterborne viruses) and carbonaceous nanomaterials may influence environmental transport of both in aquatic environments.

Title: The use of hollow fiber dialysis filters operated in axial flow mode for recovery of microorganisms in large volume water samples with high loadings of particulate matter.
Abstract: Ultrafiltration concentration of microorganisms in large volume water samples containing high levels of particulate matter was evaluated in a proof of concept study. The organisms tested were Bacillus atrophaeus subspecies globigii spores and MS2 bacteriophage. To produce the large volume samples, fresh water sediment of a known particle size was added to 51 l of tap water. Five different concentrations of particulate matter were studied: 0, 50, 100, 150 and 750 mg solids/l. The concentration procedure used a dialysis filter as the ultrafilter configured for axial flow, either with or without recirculation. The target number of organisms spiked was 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> of either spores or bacteriophage per 51 l. After concentration, the filters were dissected to retrieve the fibers which were then washed using surfactant solution which was then analyzed for the target organisms. Two washes of the filter fibers were carried out sequentially. For axial flow with recirculation, the first wash produced statistically greater recovery of B. globigii spores (26-40% of spike) compared to the second wash (8-13% of spike). Total recovery (the sum of the recoveries for the first and second washes) ranged from 35 to 53%. Recovery increased as the solids level increased from 0 to 150 mg solids/l. Recovery at the 100 and 150 mg solids/L loadings was statistically higher at the P < .05 level than recovery at 0 mg/L solids. At 150 mg solids/L, axial flow without recirculation (dead end) yielded lower recovery than axial flow with recirculation, however the difference was not significant at the P < .05 level. Recovery of B. globigii at 750 mg solids/L averaged 38% using dead end axial flow. The average recovery of MS2 bacteriophage was 45% at a solids concentration of 150 mg/L using axial flow with recirculation. PhiX174 and Phi8 were also studied, however these bacteriophage appeared to be inactivated in the matrix of concentrated wash water. One hundred liters of water containing 750 mg solids/L was concentrated using dead end axial flow, and only minimal problems with filter clogging were observed. Results described herein suggest axial flow ultrafiltration is an effective concentration method for microorganisms in water containing high levels of particulate matter.

Title: Trimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (TriFC) Assay for Visualization of RNA-Protein Interaction in Plants.
Abstract: RNA-protein interactions play important roles in various eukaryotic biological processes. Molecular imaging of subcellular localization of RNA-protein complexes in plants is critical for understanding these interactions. However, methods to image RNA-protein interactions in living plants have not yet been developed until now. Recently, we have developed a trimolecular fluorescence complementation (TriFC) system for in vivo visualization of RNA-protein interaction by transient expression in tobacco leaves. In this method, we combined conventional bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) system with the MS2 system (phage MS2 coat protein [MCP] and its binding RNA sequence [MS2 sequence]) to tag lncRNA. Target RNA is tagged with 6xMS2, and MCP and RNA-binding protein are fused with YFP fragments. DNA constructs encoding such fusion RNA and proteins are infiltrated into tobacco leaves with Agrobacterium suspensions. RNA-protein interaction in vivo is observed by confocal microscopy.

Title: Oral immunization with bacteriophage MS2-L2 VLPs protects against oral and genital infection with multiple HPV types associated with head & neck cancers and cervical cancer.
Abstract: Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the most common sexually transmitted infections. HPVs are transmitted through anogenital sex or oral sex. Anogenital transmission/infection is associated with anogenital cancers and genital warts while oral transmission/infection is associated with head and neck cancers (HNCs) including recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Current HPV vaccines protect against HPV types associated with ∼90% of cervical cancers and are expected to protect against a percentage of HNCs. However, only a few studies have assessed the efficacy of current vaccines against oral HPV infections. We had previously developed a mixed MS2-L2 candidate HPV vaccine based on bacteriophage MS2 virus-like particles (VLPs). The mixed MS2-L2 VLPs consisted of a mixture of two MS2-L2 VLPs displaying: i) a concatemer of L2 peptide (epitope 20-31) from HPV31 & L2 peptide (epitope 17-31) from HPV16 and ii) a consensus L2 peptide representing epitope 69-86. The mixed MS2-L2 VLPs neutralized/protected mice against six HPV types associated with ∼87% of cervical cancer. Here, we show that the mixed MS2-L2 VLPs can protect mice against additional HPV types; at the genital region, the VLPs protect against HPV53, 56, 11 and at the oral region, the VLPs protect against HPV16, 35, 39, 52, and 58. Thus, mixed MS2-L2 VLPs protect against eleven oncogenic HPV types associated with ∼95% of cervical cancer. The VLPs also have the potential to protect, orally, against the same oncogenic HPVs, associated with ∼99% of HNCs, including HPV11, which is associated with up to 32% of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Moreover, mixed MS2-L2 VLPs are thermostable at room temperature for up to 60 days after spray-freeze drying and they are protective against oral HPV infection.

Title: Engineering the PP7 Virus Capsid as a Peptide Display Platform.
Abstract: As self-assembling polyvalent nanoscale structures that can tolerate substantial genetic and chemical modification, virus-like particles are useful in a variety of fields. Here we describe the genetic modification and structural characterization of the Leviviridae PP7 capsid protein as a platform for the presentation of functional polypeptides. This particle was shown to tolerate the display of sequences from 1 kDa (a cell penetrating peptide) to 14 kDa (the Fc-binding double Z-domain) on its exterior surface as C-terminal genetic fusions to the coat protein. In addition, a dimeric construct allowed the presentation of exogenous loops between capsid monomers and the simultaneous presentation of two different peptides at different positions on the icosahedral structure. The PP7 particle is thereby significantly more tolerant of these types of polypeptide additions than Qβ and MS2, the other Leviviridae-derived VLPs in common use.

Title: Spatio-temporal dynamics of virus and bacteria removal in dual-media contact-filtration for drinking water.
Abstract: Microorganism removal efficiencies in deep bed filters vary with time and depth in the filter bed as the filter collects particles. Improved knowledge of such dynamics is relevant for the design, operation and microbial risk assessment of filtration processes for drinking water treatment. Here we report on a high-resolution spatio-temporal characterization of virus and bacteria removal in a pilot-scale dual-media filter, operated in contact-filtration mode. Microorganisms investigated were bacteriophage Salmonella typhimurium 28B (plaque assay, n=154)), fRNA phage MS2 (plaque assay/RT-qPCR, n=87) and E. coli (Colilert-18, n=73). Microscopic and macroscopic filtration models were used to investigate and characterize the removal dynamics. Results show that ripening/breakthrough fronts for turbidity, viruses and E. coli migrated in a wave-like manner across the depth of the filter. Virus removal improved continuously throughout the filter cycle and viruses broke through almost simultaneously with turbidity. Ripening for E. coli took longer than ripening for turbidity, but the bacteria broke through before turbidity breakthrough. Instantaneous log-removal peaked at 3.2, 3.0 and 4.5 for 28B, MS2 and E. coli, respectively. However, true average log-removal during the period of stable effluent turbidity was significantly lower at 2.5, 2.3 and 3.6, respectively. Peak observed filter coefficients λ were higher than predicted by ideal filtration theory. This study demonstrates the importance of carefully designed sampling regimes when characterizing microorganism removal efficiencies of deep bed filters.

Title: Microorganisms inactivation by wavelength combinations of ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (UV-LEDs).
Abstract: Ultraviolet light-emitting diode (UV-LED) is an emerging UV source with many special features due to the nature of semiconductor devices. One such feature is wavelength diversity that does not exist in conventional mercury based UV lamps, which provides opportunities to selectively combine multiple wavelengths for potentially additional effects by UV-LEDs. In this work, the inactivation of different microorganisms in water was investigated by UV-LEDs wavelength combinations. Various wavelength combinations, including simultaneous and sequential exposures, in different UV ranges such as UVC, UVB and UVA, were examined. These combinations were applied to the inactivation of indicator bacterium E. coli and coliphage MS2 in water. The results showed the effect of UV-LEDs multiple wavelengths depends on which wavelengths (UVC, UVB and UVA) are combined and the manner that different wavelengths (simultaneous, sequential) are used. Also, different microorganisms (bacteria, virus) respond differently to wavelength combinations. Combinations of UVC/UVB always achieved additive effect on microorganisms inactivation due to the same photochemical reaction induced by UVC/UVB on DNA. Combining UVA with UVC/UVB simultaneously or applying UVA after UVC/UVB reduced the inactivation of bacterium E. coli due to DNA repair and photoreactivation effect of UVA. However, applying extended UVA exposure before UVC significantly improved E. coli inactivation. For virus MS2 inactivation, only additive effect was observed under various wavelength combinations. This study presented a comprehensive work on UV-LEDs wavelength combinations, which is of significance on the application of UV-LEDs for water disinfection.

Title: MS2 Labeling of Endogenous Beta-Actin mRNA Does Not Result in Stabilization of Degradation Intermediates.
Abstract: The binding of MS2 bacteriophage coat protein (MCP) to MS2 binding site (MBS) RNA stem-loop sequences has been widely used to label mRNA for live-cell imaging at single-molecule resolution. However, concerns have been raised recently from studies with budding yeast showing aberrant mRNA metabolism following the MS2-GFP labeling. To investigate the degradation pattern of MS2-GFP-labeled mRNA in mammalian cells and tissues, we used Northern blot analysis of β-actin mRNA extracted from the Actb-MBS knock-in and MBS×MCP hybrid mouse models. In the immortalized mouse embryonic cell lines and various organ tissues derived from the mouse models, we found no noticeable accumulation of decay products of β-actin mRNA compared with the wild-type mice. Our results suggest that accumulation of MBS RNA decay fragments does not always happen depending on the mRNA species and the model organisms used.

In this study, the efficiency of inorganic composite-based multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) hybrid membranes was investigated in the removal of MS2 bacteriophages from contaminated water. With this object, multi-walled carbon nanotubes were coated with copper(I) oxide, titanium(IV) oxide and iron(III) oxide nanoparticles, respectively, and their virus removal capability was tested in both batch and flow experiments. Considering the possible pH range of drinking water, the filtration tests were carried out at pH 5.0, 7.5 and 9.0 as well. The extent of MS2 removal strongly depended on the pH values for each composite, which can be due to electrostatic interactions between the membrane and the virus. The most efficient removal (greater than or equal to 99.99%) was obtained with the Cu<sub>2</sub>O-coated MWCNT membrane in the whole pH range. The fabricated nanocomposites were characterized by X-ray diffraction, specific surface area measurement, dynamic light scattering, zeta potential measurement, Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. This study presents a simple route to design novel and effective nanocomposite-based hybrid membranes for virus removal.

Title: Decay rates of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., F-specific bacteriophage MS2, somatic coliphage and human adenovirus in facultative pond sludge.
Abstract: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a waste stabilization pond (WSP) system to reduce pathogen contaminants in sludge. This included examining the factors that influence the fate and concentration of human pathogens and their indicators in two sludge layers. The decay rates of five study microorganisms were determined under in-situ conditions at a WSP. The background levels of fecal origin microorganisms were consistently detected (ranging: Escherichia coli 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup>, enterococci 10<sup>1</sup> to 10<sup>3</sup>, F-specific bacteriophage (MS2) 10<sup>1</sup> to 10<sup>3</sup> and somatic coliphage 10<sup>1</sup> to 10<sup>4</sup> colony-forming units (CFU) mL<sup>-1</sup>, as well as 10<sup>1</sup> to 10<sup>2</sup> human adenovirus gene copies mL<sup>-1</sup>) in the primary facultative pond. Among microorganisms tested, the bacteria generally decayed faster than adenovirus and bacteriophage, particularly in the upper sludge layer. Due to the observed regrowth of E. coli, it may have a limited value as an indicator for pathogen removal in the wastewater stabilization ponds. The abundance of E. coli numbers within the pond biome followed changes in pond temperature over time. The results of the study suggest that viruses could survive for a long time, particularly in deeper layers (>1 metre) in the sludge, during winter months (T<sub>90</sub> = 156 d). The presence of human pathogens in WSP sludge, in particular viruses, may be a barrier to its beneficial reuse in agriculture. The results indicate that additional treatment of sludge may be required to mitigate potential public health risks from reuse of sludge for agricultural purposes.

Title: A new approach to measure the resistance of fabric to liquid and viral penetration.
Abstract: Protective clothing manufacturers routinely test their products for resistance to liquid and viral penetration. Several of the test methods specified by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for penetration testing produce binary results (i.e. pass or fail), deliver imprecise pressure regulation, and do not record the location at which penetration events occur. Instead, our approach measures a continuous variable (time of penetration) during a slow and continuous increase of hydrostatic pressure and retains the location of penetration events. Using a fluorescent dye to enhance visual detection, we evaluate temporal and spatial patterns of penetration events. We then compare the time of liquid penetration with the time of penetration of two bacteriophages (Phi-X174 and MS2). For the fabric tested, the mean viral penetration occurred 0.29 minutes earlier than liquid penetration when solved by logistic regression. The breakthrough time of MS2 was not different from the Phi-X174 bacteriophage. The time of liquid penetration was a latent indicator of the time of viral penetration.

Title: Systematic Engineering of a Protein Nanocage for High-Yield, Site-Specific Modification.
Abstract: Site-specific protein modification is a widely used strategy to attach drugs, imaging agents, or other useful small molecules to protein carriers. N-terminal modification is particularly useful as a high-yielding, site-selective modification strategy that can be compatible with a wide array of proteins. However, this modification strategy is incompatible with proteins with buried or sterically hindered N termini, such as virus-like particles (VLPs) composed of the well-studied MS2 bacteriophage coat protein. To assess VLPs with improved compatibility with these techniques, we generated a targeted library based on the MS2-derived protein cage with N-terminal proline residues followed by three variable positions. We subjected the library to assembly, heat, and chemical selections, and we identified variants that were modified in high yield with no reduction in thermostability. Positive charge adjacent to the native N terminus is surprisingly beneficial for successful extension, and over 50% of the highest performing variants contained positive charge at this position. Taken together, these studies described nonintuitive design rules governing N-terminal extensions and identified successful extensions with high modification potential.

Rating: ChatCompletionMessage(content='This abstract provides an in-depth analysis of site-specific protein modification strategies using the MS2 bacteriophage coat protein as a model.

Title: Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exosome Enrichment: A Proof-of-Concept Study for Exosome-Based Targeting Peptide Screening.
Abstract: Selection of a peptide that binds preferentially to targeted cells or tissues is a prerequisite for targeted therapy. Although in vivo phage display is a high-throughput method, it is restricted in identifying target ligands specific for different vascular beds. In this study, the exosomes are repurposed for targeting peptide screening. Briefly, the signal peptide region of Lamp2b (a membrane protein on the exosomes) in the N-terminus is engineered to fuse with 10 aa long random peptides, while the C-terminus of Lamp2b is fused with the MS2 coating protein (MCP). Then, the whole Lamp2b-MCP open reading frame (ORF) is further engineered to harbor a 3'UTR sequence consisting of MS2. The resultant exosomes from engineered Lamp2b-MCP expressing cells display the 10 aa peptides on the outside while containing the genetic information inside. By proof-of-principle experiments, the exosomes with different peptides could preferentially distribute to different tissues besides the spleen and liver. Furthermore, detailed target sequences for different tissues are enriched by rounds of selection. In summary, the established novel targeted peptide screening strategy, namely, "exosome display," has broad applicability, especially for displaying and screening targeted peptides for the cells outside the capillary with condense barriers, like the neurons in the brain.

Title: Differential Microbicidal Effects of Bimetallic Iron-Copper Nanoparticles on Escherichia coli and MS2 Coliphage.
Abstract: Bimetallic iron-copper nanoparticles (Fe/Cu-NPs) were synthesized by a single-pot surfactant-free method in aqueous solution [via the reduction of ferrous ion to zerovalent iron nanoparticles (Fe-NPs) and the subsequent copper-coating by metal ion exchange]. The produced Fe/Cu-NPs formed aggregates of spherical nanoparticles (approximately 30-70 nm) of Fe-Cu core-shell structures with 11 wt % copper content. The microbicidal effects of Fe/Cu-NPs were explored on Escherichia coli and MS2 coliphage, surrogates for bacterial and viral pathogens, respectively. Fe/Cu-NPs exhibited synergistically enhanced activity for the inactivation of E. coli and MS2, compared to single-metal nanoparticles (i.e., Fe-NPs and Cu-NPs). Various experiments (microbial inactivation tests under different conditions, fluorescence staining assays, experiments using ELISA and qRT-PCR, etc.) suggested that Fe/Cu-NPs inactivate E. coli and MS2 via dual microbicidal mechanisms. Two biocidal copper species [Cu(I) and Cu(III)] can be generated by different redox reactions of Fe/Cu-NPs. It is suggested that E. coli is strongly influenced by the cytotoxicity of Cu(I), while MS2 is inactivated mainly due to the oxidative damages of protein capsid and RNA by Cu(III).

Title: Impact of a hygiene intervention on virus spread in an office building.
Abstract: Viral illnesses have a significant direct and indirect impact on the workplace that burdens employers with increased healthcare costs, low productivity, and absenteeism. Workers' direct contact with each other and contaminated surfaces contributes to the spread of viruses at work. This study quantifies the impact of an office wellness intervention (OWI) to reduce viral load in the workplace. The OWI includes the use of a spray disinfectant on high-touch surfaces and providing workers with alcohol-based hand sanitizer gel and hand sanitizing wipes along with user instructions. Viral transmission was monitored by applying an MS2 phage tracer to a door handle and the hand of a single volunteer participant. At the same time, a placebo inoculum was applied to the hands of four additional volunteers. The purpose was to evaluate the concentration of viruses on workers' hands and office surfaces before and after the OWI. Results showed that the OWI significantly reduced viable phage concentrations per surface area on participants' hands, shared fomites, and personal fomites (p = 0.0001) with an 85.4% average reduction. Reduction of virus concentrations on hands and fomites is expected to subsequently minimize the risk of infections from common enteric and respiratory pathogens. The surfaces identified as most contaminated were the refrigerator, drawer handles and sink faucets in the break room, along with pushbar on the main exit of the building, and the soap dispensers in the women's restroom. A comparison of contamination in different locations within the office showed that the break room and women's restrooms were the sites with the highest tracer counts. Results of this study can be used to inform quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) models aimed at defining the relationship between surface contamination, pathogen exposure and the probability of disease that contributes to high healthcare costs, absenteeism, presenteeism, and loss of productivity in the workplace.

Title: Comparison of biological weighting functions used to model endogenous sunlight inactivation rates of MS2 coliphage.
Abstract: Sunlight inactivation is important for disinfection of viruses in sunlit waters. As such, attempts have been made to predict the endogenous photoinactivation rate of bacteriophage MS2 using biological weighting functions, which describe microorganism sensitivity to sunlight inactivation as a function of wavelength. In this study, four biological weighting function models were compared to assess their ability to predict endogenous inactivation rates (k<sub>endo</sub>) of MS2. Previously-published and newly-collected datasets consisting of an incident irradiance spectrum (used as an input to the model) and a measured inactivation rate (k<sub>obs</sub>) were used for model validation and comparison. k<sub>endo</sub> values predicted by each model were compared with measured k<sub>obs</sub> to evaluate the ability of each biological weighting function to predict endogenous sunlight inactivation rates. A model previously developed by Mattle et al. (Env. Sci. Technol. 49, 334-342) over-predicted inactivation rates, whereas the other three models - a model from Fisher et al. (Env. Sci. Technol. 45, 9249-9255), a new model developed in this study, and a modification of the model by Mattle et al. (developed as part of this study) - were better able to estimate inactivation rates. The biological relevance of the spectral shape of each biological weighting function is discussed.

Title: MS2 coliphage and E. coli UVB inactivation rates in optically clear water: dose, dose rate and temperature dependence.
Abstract: Natural ultraviolet irradiance disinfection is known to play a significant role in both natural wastewater treatment systems and drinking water disinfection processes, while the influence of ultraviolet B (UVB) delivering method on sunlight disinfection outcome is still unclear. This study aims to determine the effects of environmentally relevant temperatures, UVB doses (J m<sup>-2</sup>) and dose rates (W m<sup>-2</sup>) on the inactivation and log reduction values (LRVs) of the F-RNA coliphage MS2 and Escherichia coli in optically clear water. E. coli and MS2 were separately incubated and irradiated at five different doses of UVB light that delivered using six UVB dose rates. The results of the study demonstrate that the UVB dose delivering method (combination of dose rate and exposure time) influences inactivation and LRVs of E. coli and MS2 at all UVB doses investigated (up to seven-fold difference). Two phases were identified within the UVB dose rate, UVB inactivation or LRV curves for both organisms; a UVB dose rate limited inactivation phase and a dose rate saturation inactivation phase. The results contribute to a better understanding of UVB disinfection in the environment and natural wastewater treatment systems, potentially improving the design and operation of high rate algal ponds.

Title: Digital Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification on a Commercial Membrane.
Abstract: In this work, we report digital loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) or reverse-transcription LAMP (RT-LAMP) on a commercial membrane, without the need for complex chip fabrication or use of specialized equipment. Due to the pore size distribution, the theoretical error for digital LAMP on these membranes was analyzed, using a combination of Random Distribution Model and Multivolume Theory. A facile peel-off process was developed for effective droplet formation on the commercial track-etched polycarbonate (PCTE) membrane. Each pore functions as an individual nanoreactor for single DNA amplification. Absolute quantification of bacteria genomic DNA was realized with a dynamic range from 11 to 1.1 × 10<sup>5</sup> copies/μL. One-step digital RT-LAMP was also successfully performed on the membrane for the quantification of MS2 virus in wastewater. With the introduction of new probes, the positive pores can be easily distinguished from negative ones with 100 times difference in fluorescence intensities. Finally, the cost of a disposable membrane is less than $0.10/piece, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the most inexpensive way to perform digital LAMP. The membrane system offers opportunities for point-of-care users or common laboratories to perform digital quantification, single cell analysis, or other bioassays in an inexpensive, flexible, and simplified way.

Title: Transmission of hepatitis E virus by water: An issue still pending in industrialized countries.
Abstract: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an enteric virus divided into eight genotypes. Genotype 1 (G1) and G2 are specific to humans; G3, G4 and G7 are zoonotic genotypes infecting humans and animals. Transmission to humans through water has been demonstrated for G1 and G2, mainly in developing countries, but is only suspected for the zoonotic genotypes. Thus, the water-related HEV hazard may be due to human and animal faeces. The high HEV genetic variability allows considering the presence in wastewater of not only different genotypes, but also quasispecies adding even greater diversity. Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that HEV particles may be either quasi-enveloped or non-enveloped, potentially implying differential viral behaviours in the environment. The presence of HEV has been demonstrated at the different stages of the water cycle all over the world, especially for HEV G3 in Europe and the USA. Concerning HEV survival in water, the virus does not have higher resistance to inactivating factors (heat, UV, chlorine, physical removal), compared to viral indicators (MS2 phage) or other highly resistant enteric viruses (Hepatitis A virus). But the studies did not take into account genetic (genogroups, quasispecies) or structural (quasi- or non-enveloped forms) HEV variability. Viral variability could indeed modify HEV persistence in water by influencing its interaction with the environment, its infectivity and its pathogenicity, and subsequently its transmission by water. The cell culture methods used to study HEV survival still have drawbacks (challenging virus cultivation, time consuming, lack of sensitivity). As explained in the present review, the issue of HEV transmission to humans through water is similar to that of other enteric viruses because of their similar or lower survival. HEV transmission to animals through water and how the virus variability affects its survival and transmission remain to be investigated.

Title: Influence of water antimicrobials and storage conditions on inactivating MS2 bacteriophage on strawberries.
Abstract: Foodborne illnesses caused by norovirus contaminated fresh produce remain a food safety concern worldwide. In the present study, the impacts of commercial and home processing conditions of strawberries were evaluated for inactivation of the MS2 bacteriophage. MS2 was used as a surrogate of norovirus and was spot inoculated onto strawberries to achieve 6.6 log PFU/g. The inoculated strawberries were washed with tap water, electrolyzed water, or 50 ppm chlorine for 90 s prior to and after storage. After initial washing, the strawberries were separately stored at -20 °C and -80 °C for 30 days. Change in MS2 populations on strawberries was evaluated by plaque assay method on day 1, 15, and 30 for -20 °C and -80 °C groups. The results showed that washing strawberries prior to storage resulted in a significant decrease (approximately 1 log PFU/g) of MS2 population regardless of the treatment (p < 0.05). Frozen storage had minor effects on inactivating MS2, which resulted in approximately a 0.5 log PFU/g reduction at the end of storage. Washing frozen berries in electrolyzed water or 50 ppm chlorine on day 30 resulted in an additional 1 log PFU/g decrease in MS2 compared to water alone. These results suggest that washing strawberries with a chemical antimicrobial prior to and post frozen storage may enhance microbial safety.

Title: Live E. coli bacteria label-free sensing using a microcavity in-line Mach-Zehnder interferometer.
Abstract: The paper presents the first study to date on selective label-free biosensing with a microcavity in-line Mach-Zehnder interferometer induced in an optical fiber. The sensing structures were fabricated in a single-mode fiber by femtosecond laser micromachining. In contrast to other studies of this sensing scheme, where only the sensitivity to refractive index changes in the cavity was investigated, this research used chemical surface treatment of the sensor to ensure detection specificity. Immobilized MS2 bacteriophages were applied as recognition elements specifically targeting live E. coli C3000 bacteria. It is shown that the sensor allows for real-time monitoring of biological phenomena taking place on the surface of the microcavity. The developed biosensor exhibits ultrahigh refractive index sensitivity of 15,000 nm/RIU and is capable of detecting live E. coli bacteria concentrations as low as 100 colony forming units (CFU)/mL in liquid volume as low as picoliters.

Title: Phage single-gene lysis: Finding the weak spot in the bacterial cell wall.
Abstract: In general, the last step in the vegetative cycle of bacterial viruses, or bacteriophages, is lysis of the host. dsDNA phages require multiple lysis proteins, including at least one enzyme that degrades the cell wall (peptidoglycan (PG)). In contrast, the lytic ssDNA and ssRNA phages have a single lysis protein that achieves cell lysis without enzymatically degrading the PG. Here, we review four "single-gene lysis" or Sgl proteins. Three of the Sgls block bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to and inhibiting several enzymes in the PG precursor pathway. The target of the fourth Sgl, L from bacteriophage MS2, is still unknown, but we review evidence indicating that it is likely a protein involved in maintaining cell wall integrity. Although only a few phage genomes are available to date, the ssRNA <i>Leviviridae</i> are a rich source of novel Sgls, which may facilitate further unraveling of bacterial cell wall biosynthesis and discovery of new antibacterial agents.

Title: An in Vivo Binding Assay for RNA-Binding Proteins Based on Repression of a Reporter Gene.
Abstract: We study translation repression in bacteria by engineering a regulatory circuit that functions as a binding assay for RNA binding proteins (RBP) in vivo. We do so by inducing expression of a fluorescent protein-RBP chimera, together with encoding its binding site at various positions within the ribosomal initiation region (+11-13 nt from the AUG) of a reporter module. We show that when bound by their cognate RBPs, the phage coat proteins for PP7 (PCP) and Qβ (QCP), strong repression is observed for all hairpin positions within the initiation region. Yet, a sharp transition to no-effect is observed when positioned in the elongation region, at a single-nucleotide resolution. Employing in vivo Selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension followed by sequencing (SHAPE-seq) for a representative construct, established that in the translationally active state the mRNA molecule is nonstructured, while in the repressed state a structured signature was detected. We then utilize this regulatory phenomena to quantify the binding affinity of the coat proteins of phages MS2, PP7, GA, and Qβ to 14 cognate and noncognate binding sites in vivo. Using our circuit, we demonstrate qualitative differences between in vitro to in vivo binding characteristics for various variants when comparing to past studies. Furthermore, by introducing a simple mutation to the loop region for the Qβ-wt site, MCP binding is abolished, creating the first high-affinity QCP site that is completely orthogonal to MCP. Consequently, we demonstrate that our hybrid transcriptional-post-transcriptional circuit can be utilized as a binding assay to quantify RNA-RBP interactions in vivo.

Title: Biological Weighting Functions for Evaluating the Role of Sunlight-Induced Inactivation of Coliphages at Selected Beaches and Nearby Tributaries.
Abstract: Coliphages can indicate contamination of recreational waters and previous studies show that sunlight is important in altering densities of coliphages, other indicator microorganisms, and pathogens in aquatic environments. Here, we report on laboratory studies of light-induced inactivation of two coliphage groups-male-specific (F+) and somatic coliphage-under various conditions in phosphate-buffered water (PBW). Strains isolated from wastewater treatment facilities and laboratory strains (MS2 and phiX174 coliphages) were evaluated. Inactivation rates were determined in a series of irradiations using simulated solar radiation passed through light filters that blocked different parts of the ultraviolet spectral region. Inactivation rates and spectral irradiance from these experiments were then analyzed to develop biological weighting functions (BWFs) for the light-induced inactivation. BWFs were used to model the inactivation of coliphages over a range of conditions in aquatic environments that included two beach sites in Lake Michigan and one in Lake Erie. For example, modeled effects of sunlight attenuation, using UV absorption data from the three Great Lakes beach sites, inferred that direct photoinactivation rate constants, averaged over a one-meter water column in swimmable areas, were reduced 2- to 5-fold, compared to near-surface rate constants.

Title: Photodynamic inactivation of non-enveloped RNA viruses.
Abstract: We recently reported the photodynamic inactivation (PDI) of bacteriophage MS2 with a photosensitiser- 5, 10, 15, 20-tetrakis (1-methyl-4-pyridinio) porphyrin- tetra- p-toluene sulfonate (TMPyP) in solution and concluded that the A-protein of the virus is the main target of inactivation. Here, we have extended these studies and carried out PDI of bacteriophage Qβ, bovine enterovirus 2 (BEV-2) and type 1 murine norovirus (MNV-1). The rate of inactivation observed was in the order MS2 > Qβ > MNV-1 > BEV-2. Data suggested that TMPyP-treatment could also target the viral genome as well as result in disintegration/disassembly of viral particles. Although emergence of viral drug resistance is a well-documented phenomenon, it was not possible to generate PDI-resistant MS2. However, emergence of a mutation in the lysis protein was detected after serial exposure to PDI.

Title: Rapid and selective concentration of bacteria, viruses, and proteins using alternating current signal superimposition on two coplanar electrodes.
Abstract: Dielectrophoresis (DEP) is usually effective close to the electrode surface. Several techniques have been developed to overcome its drawbacks and to enhance dielectrophoretic particle capture. Here we present a simple technique of superimposing alternating current DEP (high-frequency signals) and electroosmosis (EO; low-frequency signals) between two coplanar electrodes (gap: 25 μm) using a lab-made voltage adder for rapid and selective concentration of bacteria, viruses, and proteins, where we controlled the voltages and frequencies of DEP and EO separately. This signal superimposition technique enhanced bacterial capture (Escherichia coli K-12 against 1-μm-diameter polystyrene beads) more selectively (>99%) and rapidly (~30 s) at lower DEP (5 Vpp) and EO (1.2 Vpp) potentials than those used in the conventional DEP capture studies. Nanometer-sized MS2 viruses and troponin I antibody proteins were also concentrated using the superimposed signals, and significantly more MS2 and cTnI-Ab were captured using the superimposed signals than the DEP (10 Vpp) or EO (2 Vpp) signals alone (p < 0.035) between the two coplanar electrodes and at a short exposure time (1 min). This technique has several advantages, such as simplicity and low cost of electrode fabrication, rapid and large collection without electrolysis.

Title: Ultraviolet A and B wavelength-dependent inactivation of viruses and bacteria in the water.
Abstract: UVA and UVB can be applied to solar disinfection of water. In this study, the inactivation and photoreactivation of viruses and bacteria in the UVA-B range were analyzed. MS2 and T4 bacteriophages, and Escherichia coli were used as surrogates to quantify dose-response behaviors. Inactivation in UVC was used to validate the methodology and to expand the inactivation action spectra. The results showed log-linear inactivation for MS2 and T4 in the 254-320 nm wavelength range. T4 inactivation was consistently faster than MS2 (except at 320 nm), and for both phages, inactivation decreased with increasing wavelength. The dose-response of bacteria exhibited a lag at low doses, possibly because the photons must strike a discrete number of critical targets before growth stops. A tail was present at high doses for some wavelengths, perhaps due to clumping or the presence of subgroups with higher resistance. The inactivation action spectra for bacteria exhibited a reduction in inactivation as wavelength increased. No bacterial inactivation was observed beyond 320 nm at doses applied. After inactivation at 297 nm (UVA), bacteria regained viability through photoreactivation, and repair increased with increase in photoreactivating light exposure time. This implies additional doses above inactivation thresholds are required to cause irreversible damage. These results are useful for designing solar disinfection systems.

Title: Intracellular RNA-tracking methods.
Abstract: RNA tracking allows researchers to visualize RNA molecules in cells and tissues, providing important spatio-temporal information regarding RNA dynamics and function. Methods such as fluorescent <i>in situ</i> hybridization (FISH) and molecular beacons rely on complementary oligonucleotides to label and view endogenous transcripts. Other methods create artificial chimeric transcripts coupled with bacteriophage-derived coat proteins (e.g. MS2, λN) to tag molecules in live cells. In other approaches, endogenous RNAs are recognized by complementary RNAs complexed with noncatalytic Cas proteins. Each technique has its own set of strengths and limitations that must be considered when planning an experiment. Here, we discuss the mechanisms, advantages, and weaknesses of <i>in situ</i> hybridization, molecular beacons, MS2 tagging and Cas-derived systems, as well as how RNA tracking can be employed to study various aspects of molecular biology.

Title: Influence of algal organic matter on MS2 bacteriophage inactivation by ultraviolet irradiation at 220 nm and 254 nm.
Abstract: We determined the potential interference of extracellular algal organic matter (EAOM) and intracellular algal organic matter (IAOM) extracted from Microcystis aeruginosa on MS2 bacteriophage inactivation under UV irradiation at two wavelengths (220 and 254 nm). UV irradiation at 220 nm doubled the inactivation rate of MS2 in water containing EAOM than in organic-free phosphate buffered solution. In contrast, EAOM did not change MS2 inactivation by exposure to UV 254 nm. The presence of IAOM did not significantly influence MS2 inactivation by exposure to either UV 254 or UV 220 nm. To achieve 3 log<sub>10</sub> inactivation of MS2, UV254 nm required more than double the dose of UV220 nm (45 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> vs. 20 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>). Linear correlations between the reduction in infectivity and the reduction in genome copies detected by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction suggested that genomic damage is the main mechanism responsible for MS2 inactivation in water containing algal organic matter (AOM) by exposure to UV irradiation. These findings suggest that the presence of AOM did not negatively influence MS2 inactivation by either 220 or 254 nm irradiation, and that a lower UV dose of 220 nm irradiation can be used to achieve the same level of inactivation in water containing AOM.

Title: Single-mRNA detection in living S. cerevisiae using a re-engineered MS2 system.
Abstract: The MS2 system has been widely used, in organisms ranging from bacteria to higher eukaryotes, to image single mRNAs in intact cells with high precision. We have recently re-engineered the MS2 system for accurate detection of mRNAs in living Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Previous MS2 systems affected the degradation of the tagged mRNA, which led to accumulation of MS2 fragments and to erroneous conclusions about mRNA localization and expression. Here we describe a step-by-step protocol for the use of our latest MS2 system (MBSV6) for detecting endogenously tagged mRNAs using wide-field fluorescent microscopy in living yeast. The procedure is divided into three stages: tagging of endogenous gene with MBSV6 (~2 weeks), a two-color single-molecule RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH) procedure to quantitatively assess whether mRNAs tagged with MS2 and MS2-coat protein (MCP) behave like untagged mRNAs (2 d, plus additional time for quantification), and a procedure to quantify single mRNAs by live imaging using wide-field microscopy (1 d, plus additional time for quantification). With this method it is now possible to interrogate all phases of mRNA expression, from transcription through decay. The described protocol is designed for S. cerevisiae; however, we think that our approach and the considerations discussed here can be extended to Escherichia coli, Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, and mammalian cells.

Title: Transfer of Enteric Viruses Adenovirus and Coxsackievirus and Bacteriophage MS2 from Liquid to Human Skin.
Abstract: Indirect exposure to waterborne viruses increases the risk of infection, especially among children with frequent hand-to-mouth contacts. Here, we quantified the transfer of one bacteriophage (MS2) and two enteric viruses (adenovirus and coxsackievirus) from liquid to skin. MS2, a commonly used enteric virus surrogate, was used to compare virus transfer rates in a volunteer trial to those obtained using human cadaver skin and synthetic skin. MS2 transfer to volunteer skin was similar to transfer to cadaver skin but significantly different from transfer to synthetic skin. The transfer of MS2, adenovirus, and coxsackievirus to cadaver skin was modeled using measurements for viruses attaching to the skin (adsorbed) and viruses in liquid residual on skin (unadsorbed). We find virus transfer per surface area is a function of the concentration of virus in the liquid and the film thickness of liquid retained on the skin and is estimable using a linear model. Notably, the amount of MS2 adsorbed on the skin was on average 5 times higher than the amount of adenovirus and 4 times higher than the amount of coxsackievirus. Quantification of pathogenic virus retention to skin would thus be overestimated using MS2 adsorption data. This study provides models of virus transfer useful for risk assessments of water-related activities, demonstrates significant differences in the transfer of pathogenic virus and MS2, and suggests cadaver skin as an alternative testing system for studying interactions between viruses and skin.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Enteric viruses (viruses that infect the gastrointestinal tract) are responsible for most water-transmitted diseases. They are shed in high concentrations in the feces of infected individuals, persist for an extended period of time in water, and are highly infective. Exposure to contaminated water directly (through ingestion) or indirectly (for example, through hand-water contacts followed by hand-to-mouth contacts) increases the risk of virus transmission. The work described herein provides a quantitative model for estimating human-pathogenic virus retention on skin following contact with contaminated water. The work will be important in refining the contribution of indirect transmission of virus to risks associated with water-related activities.

Title: Free Chlorine Disinfection of Full-Scale MBR Effluent to Achieve 5-Log Virus Inactivation.
Abstract:   A series of full-scale testing was performed at the City of Lathrop Consolidated Treatment Facility to determine the "concentration times time" (Ct) value for free chlorine disinfection of nitrified membrane bioreactor (MBR) effluent to achieve more than 5-log virus inactivation. The full-scale testing consisted of tracer study, chlorine decay study, and virus seeding study. The virus seeding study was performed at a flow rate of 1 million gal/d (3800 m3/min), which corresponded to a theoretical contact time of 117 minutes in the chlorine contact basin. It was found that Ct values as small as 3 mg·min/L were sufficient to achieve 5-log inactivation of MS2 bacteriophage in this study, which is comparable to the results of previous bench- and pilot-scale free chlorine disinfection studies on nitrified MBR effluent (3 to 40 mg·min/L), as well as those of pilot- and full-scale studies on granular media-filtered nitrified effluent (2 to 22 mg·min/L).

Title: Inactivation of feline calicivirus using ultraviolet light-emitting diodes.
Abstract: Ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (UV-LEDs) with peak emission wavelengths of 265, 280 and 300 nm were applied for the inactivation of feline calicivirus (FCV) in water, and the results were compared to those derived with a common viral surrogate coliphage MS2. The fluence response profiles indicated that the log10-based inactivation rate constant of FCV was 0.113, 0.101 and 0.007 cm2 mJ-1 for the 265, 280 and 300 nm UV-LEDs, respectively, while that of MS2 was 0.034, 0.033 and 0.003 cm2 mJ-1 for the 265, 280 and 300 nm UV-LEDs, respectively. Namely, FCV was about two to three times more sensitive than MS2 to germicidal UV emissions adopted in this study, and the 265 nm and 280 nm UV-LEDs were particularly effective to inactivate FCV. Results of this study are to be a part of database on fluence response profiles of various microorganisms, which would foster the development of disinfection apparatuses equipped with UV-LEDs.

Title: Pond walls: inclined planes to improve pathogen removal in pond systems for wastewater treatment?
Abstract: Attenuation of sunlight in wastewater treatment ponds reduces the depth of the water exposed to disinfecting irradiances. Shallow pond depth with paddlewheel rotation increases exposure of pathogens to sunlight in high rate algal ponds. Generation of thin films, using pond walls as inclined planes, may increase inactivation of pathogens by increasing sunlight exposure. The performance of a laboratory based model system incorporating an inclined plane (IP) was evaluated. F-RNA bacteriophage, in tap water or wastewater, was exposed to sunlight only on the IP with the bulk water incubated in the dark. MS2 inactivation was significantly higher when the IP was present (P < 0.05) with a 63% increase observed. Prolonged exposure increased MS2 die-off irrespective of IP presence. Versatility of the IP was also demonstrated with faster inactivation observed in both optically clear tap water and wastewaters. IPs of different surface areas produced similar inactivation rates when operated at similar hydraulic loading rates regardless of slope length.

Rating: ChatCompletionMessage(content='This abstract discusses the potential use of inclined planes in wastewater treatment ponds to increase sunlight exposure and inactivate pathogens, including the MS2 phage.

Title: A new approach to testing the efficacy of drinking water disinfectants.
Abstract: New disinfection procedures are being developed and proposed for use in drinking-water production. Authorising their use requires an effective test strategy that can simulate conditions in practice. For this purpose, we developed a test rig working in a flow-through mode similar to the disinfection procedures in waterworks, but under tightly defined conditions, including very short contact times. To quantify the influence of DOC, temperature and pH on the efficacy of two standard disinfectants, chlorine and chlorine dioxide, simulated use tests were systematically performed. This test rig enabled quantitative comparison of the reduction of four test organisms, two viruses and two bacteria, in response to disinfection. Chlorine was substantially more effective against Enterococcus faecium than chlorine dioxide whereas the latter was more effective against the bacteriophage MS2, especially at pH values of >7.5 at which chlorine efficacies already decline. Contrary to expectation, bacteria were not generally reduced more quickly than viruses. Overall, the results confirm a high efficacy of chlorine and chlorine dioxide, validating them as standard disinfectants for assessing the efficacy of new disinfectants. Furthermore, these data demonstrate that the test rig is an appropriate tool for testing new disinfectants as well as disinfection procedures.

Title: Beyond structures of highly symmetric purified viral capsids by cryo-EM.
Abstract: Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is widely used to determine high-resolution structures of symmetric virus capsids. The method holds promise for extending studies beyond purified capsids and their symmetric protein shells. The non-symmetric genome component has been addressed in dsRNA cypoviruses and ssRNA bacteriophages Qβ and MS2. The structure of human herpes simplex virus type 1 capsids has been determined within intact virions to resolve capsid-tegument interactions. Electron tomography under cryogenic conditions (cryo-ET), has allowed resolving an early membrane fusion intermediate of Rift Valley fever virus. Antibody-affinity based sample grids allow capturing of virions directly from cell cultures or even clinical samples. These and other emerging methods will support studies to address viral entry, assembly and neutralization processes at increasingly high resolutions and native conditions.

Title: Sensitive detection of live Escherichia coli by bacteriophage amplification-coupled immunoassay on the Luminex® MAGPIX instrument.
Abstract: Phages are natural predators of bacteria and have been exploited in bacterial detection because of their exquisite specificity to their cognate bacterial hosts. In this study, we present a "proof of concept" bacteriophage amplification-coupled assay as a surrogate for detecting a bacterium present in a sample. The assay entails detection of progeny phage resulting from infection and subsequent growth inside the bacterium present in suspected samples. This approach reduces testing time and enhances sensitivity to identify pathogens compared to traditional overnight plaque assay. Further, the assay has the ability to discriminate between live and dead cells since phages require live host cells to infect and replicate. To demonstrate its utility, phage MS2 amplification-coupled, bead-based sandwich type immunoassay on the Luminex® MAGPIX instrument for Escherichia coli detection was performed. The assay not only showed live cell discrimination ability but also a limit of E. coli detection of 1 × 10<sup>2</sup> cells/mL of live cells after a 3-h incubation. In addition, the sensitivity of the assay was not impaired in the presence of dead cells. These results demonstrate that bacteriophage amplification-coupled assay can be a rapid live cell detection assay compared to traditional culture methods and a promising tool for quick validation of bacterial inactivation. Combined with the unique multiplex bead chemistry of the Luminex® MAGPIX platform, the phage assay can be expanded to be an ultra-deep multiplex assay for the simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens using specific phages directed against the target pathogens.

Title: Hygiene aspect of treating human urine by alkaline dehydration.
Abstract: Over four billion people are discharging untreated human excreta into the environment without any prior treatment, causing eutrophication and spreading disease. The most nutrient rich fraction is the urine. Urine can be collected separately and dehydrated in an alkaline bed producing a nutrient rich fertiliser. However, faecal cross-contamination during the collection risks to introduce pathogens to the urine. The objective of this hygiene assessment was to study the inactivation of five microorganisms (Ascaris suum, Enterococcus faecalis, bacteriophages MS2 and ΦX 174 and Salmonella spp) in alkaline dehydrated urine. Fresh human urine was dehydrated in wood ash at 42 °C until the pH decreased to ≤10.5, at which point the saturated ash was inoculated with faeces containing the microorganisms and left open to the air (mimicking stockpiling of the end product) at temperatures of 20 and 42 °C. The bacteria and bacteriophages were inactivated to below the detection limit (100 cfu ml<sup>-1</sup> for bacteria; 10 pfu mL<sup>-1</sup> for bacteriophages) within four days storage at 20 °C. A. suum inactivation data was fitted to a non-linear regression model, which estimated a required 325 days of storage at 20 °C and 9.2 days at 42 °C to reach a 3 log<sub>10</sub> reduction.

Title: Coagulant residues' influence on virus enumeration as shown in a study on virus removal using aluminium, zirconium and chitosan.
Abstract: Research on microorganism reduction by physicochemical water treatment is often carried out under the assumption that the microbiological enumeration techniques are not affected by the presence of coagulants. Data presented here indicate that bacteriophage enumeration by plaque assay and RT-qPCR (reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction) can be affected by these water treatment chemicals. Treatment of water samples with an alkaline protein-rich solution prior to plaque assay and optimization of RNA extraction for RT-qPCR were implemented to minimize the interference. The improved procedures were used in order to investigate reduction of three viral pathogens and the MS2 model virus in the presence of three coagulants. A conventional aluminium coagulant was compared to alternative agents (zirconium and chitosan) in a coagulation-filtration system. The highest virus reduction, i.e., 99.9-99.99%, was provided by chitosan, while aluminium and zirconium reduced virus by 99.9% in colour-rich water and by 90% in water with less colour, implying an effect of coagulant type and raw water quality on virus reduction. Although charge characteristics of viruses were associated with virus reduction, the results reveal that the MS2 phage is a suitable model for aggregation and retention of the selected pathogens.

Title: Genome packaging within icosahedral capsids and large-scale segmentation in viral genomic sequences.
Abstract: The assembly and maturation of viruses with icosahedral capsids must be coordinated with icosahedral symmetry. The icosahedral symmetry imposes also the restrictions on the cooperative specific interactions between genomic RNA/DNA and coat proteins that should be reflected in quasi-regular segmentation of viral genomic sequences. Combining discrete direct and double Fourier transforms, we studied the quasi-regular large-scale segmentation in genomic sequences of different ssRNA, ssDNA, and dsDNA viruses. The particular representatives included satellite tobacco mosaic virus (STMV) and the strains of satellite tobacco necrosis virus (STNV), STNV-C, STNV-1, STNV-2, Escherichia phages MS2, ϕX174, α3, and HK97, and Simian virus 40. In all their genomes, we found the significant quasi-regular segmentation of genomic sequences related to the virion assembly and the genome packaging within icosahedral capsid. We also found good correspondence between our results and available cryo-electron microscopy data on capsid structures and genome packaging in these viruses. Fourier analysis of genomic sequences provides the additional insight into mechanisms of hierarchical genome packaging and may be used for verification of the concepts of 3-fold or 5-fold intermediates in virion assembly. The results of sequence analysis should be taken into account at the choice of models and data interpretation. They also may be helpful for the development of antiviral drugs.

Title: Copper-Coated Cellulose-Based Water Filters for Virus Retention.
Abstract: Despite recent efforts in modernization of water treatment facilities, the problem of access to healthy drinking water for hundreds of millions of people has still not been solved. A water filter based on Cu-coated nanofibrillated cellulose with controlled porosity was prepared by the "paper-making" method. We have optimized the proper mass and ratio of functionalized and pure nanofibrillated cellulose for the preparation of the filter. MS2 bacteriophages were used to model human pathogenic virions. We tested our filter material in batch experiments and the fixed filters in flow experiments. The fabricated Cu-coated nanofibrillated cellulose filters were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, specific surface area measurement (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller), dynamic light scattering, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. Our measurements proved that the fixation of cellulose nanofibers plays a significant role in the degree of virus retention and it greatly enhances the efficiency of the filtration. By using these functionalized water filters, we were able to achieve a virus retention of at least 5 magnitudes (5Log) at three different pH values: 5.0, 7.5, and 9.

Abstract: The study of bacteriophages (phages) and prophages has provided key insights into almost every cellular process as well as led to the discovery of unexpected new mechanisms and the development of valuable tools. This is exemplified for RNA-based regulation. For instance, the characterization and exploitation of the antiphage CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat) systems is revolutionizing molecular biology. Phage-encoded proteins such as the RNA-binding MS2 protein, which is broadly used to isolate tagged RNAs, also have been developed as valuable tools. Hfq, the RNA chaperone protein central to the function of many base-pairing small RNAs (sRNAs), was first characterized as a bacterial host factor required for Qβ phage replication. The ongoing studies of RNAs are continuing to reveal regulatory connections between infecting phages, prophages, and bacteria and to provide novel insights. There are bacterial and prophage sRNAs that regulate prophage genes, which impact bacterial virulence as well as bacterial cell killing. Conversely, phage- and prophage-encoded sRNAs modulate the expression of bacterial genes modifying metabolism. An interesting subcategory of the prophage-encoded sRNAs are sponge RNAs that inhibit the activities of bacterial-encoded sRNAs. Phages also affect posttranscriptional regulation in bacteria through proteins that inhibit or alter the activities of key bacterial proteins involved in posttranscriptional regulation. However, what is most exciting about phage and prophage research, given the millions of phage-encoded genes that have not yet been characterized, is the vast potential for discovering new RNA regulators and novel mechanisms and for gaining insight into the evolution of regulatory RNAs.

Title: Synergy of MS2 disinfection by sequential exposure to tailored UV wavelengths.
Abstract: The advantages of polychromatic ultraviolet (UV) light for viral disinfection can be optimized for disinfection using emerging tailored wavelength sources including KrCl excimer lamps and light emitting diodes (LEDs). Disinfection of the common viral surrogate MS2 bacteriophage was measured after exposure to these emerging sources and conventional low pressure (LP) mercury UV lamps in individual or sequential exposures. The first dose response for any virus (MS2) exposed to a KrCl excimer lamp is reported, showing the high efficiency of fluence-based disinfection because of increased viral susceptibility at the low wavelengths emitted by the excilamp. Sequential exposure dose responses indicated synergy from sequential exposures of LP and excimer lamps, which were competitive on an electrical basis at worst-and best-case scenarios of wall plug efficiency with current medium pressure (MP) disinfection. Best-case scenarios for electrical efficiency also showed all sequential exposures to be competitive with MP UV disinfection. Predictive models for sequential exposure dose responses were assessed to support the current feasibility of incorporating sequential UV exposures to optimize tailored wavelength viral disinfection.

Title: Mechanism of Virus Inactivation by Cold Atmospheric-Pressure Plasma and Plasma-Activated Water.
Abstract: Viruses cause serious pathogenic contamination that severely affects the environment and human health. Cold atmospheric-pressure plasma efficiently inactivates pathogenic bacteria; however, the mechanism of virus inactivation by plasma is not fully understood. In this study, surface plasma in argon mixed with 1% air and plasma-activated water was used to treat water containing bacteriophages. Both agents efficiently inactivated bacteriophages T4, Φ174, and MS2 in a time-dependent manner. Prolonged storage had marginal effects on the antiviral activity of plasma-activated water. DNA and protein analysis revealed that the reactive species generated by plasma damaged both nucleic acids and proteins, consistent with the morphological examination showing that plasma treatment caused the aggregation of bacteriophages. The inactivation of bacteriophages was alleviated by the singlet oxygen scavengers, demonstrating that singlet oxygen played a primary role in this process. Our findings provide a potentially effective disinfecting strategy to combat the environmental viruses using cold atmospheric-pressure plasma and plasma-activated water.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Contamination with pathogenic and infectious viruses severely threatens human health and animal husbandry. Current methods for disinfection have different disadvantages, such as inconvenience and contamination of disinfection by-products (e.g., chlorine disinfection). In this study, atmospheric surface plasma in argon mixed with air and plasma-activated water was found to efficiently inactivate bacteriophages, and plasma-activated water still had strong antiviral activity after prolonged storage. Furthermore, it was shown that bacteriophage inactivation was associated with damage to nucleic acids and proteins by singlet oxygen. An understanding of the biological effects of plasma-based treatment is useful to inform the development of plasma into a novel disinfecting strategy with convenience and no by-product.

Title: Protein-RNA Interactions in the Single-Stranded RNA Bacteriophages.
Abstract: Bacteriophages of the Leviviridae family are small viruses with short single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genomes. Protein-RNA interactions play a key role throughout the phage life cycle, and all of the conserved phage proteins - the maturation protein, the coat protein and the replicase - are able to recognize specific structures in the RNA genome. The phage-coded replicase subunit associates with several host proteins to form a catalytically active complex. Recognition of the genomic RNA by the replicase complex is achieved in a remarkably complex manner that exploits the RNA-binding properties of host proteins and the particular three-dimensional structure of the phage genome. The coat protein recognizes a hairpin structure at the beginning of the replicase gene. The binding interaction serves to regulate the expression of the replicase gene and can be remarkably different in various ssRNA phages. The maturation protein is a minor structural component of the virion that binds to the genome, mediates attachment to the host and guides the genome into the cell. The maturation protein has two distinct RNA-binding surfaces that are in contact with different regions of the genome. The maturation and coat proteins also work together to ensure the encapsidation of the phage genome in new virus particles. In this chapter, the different ssRNA phage protein-RNA interactions, as well as some of their practical applications, are discussed in detail.

Title: Reactivity of Enveloped Virus Genome, Proteins, and Lipids with Free Chlorine and UV<sub>254</sub>.
Abstract: The survivability of viruses in natural and engineered systems impacts public health. Inactivation mechanisms in the environment have been described for nonenveloped viruses, but it remains unclear how the membrane layer of enveloped viruses influences inactivation. We applied molecular tools and high-resolution mass spectrometry to measure reactions in the genome, proteins, and lipids of enveloped Pseudomonas phage Phi6 during inactivation by free chlorine and UV<sub>254</sub>. Free chlorine readily penetrated the lipid membrane to react with proteins in the nucleocapsid and polymerase complex. The most reactive Phi6 peptides were approximately 150 times more reactive with free chlorine than the most reactive peptides reported in nonenveloped coliphage MS2. The inactivation kinetics of Phi6 by UV<sub>254</sub> was comparable with those of nonenveloped adenovirus and coliphage MS2 and were driven by UV<sub>254</sub> reactions with viral genomes. Our research identifies molecular features of an enveloped virus that are susceptible to chemical oxidants or UV radiation. Finally, the framework developed in the manuscript for studying molecular reactivities of Phi6 can be adopted to investigate enveloped virus survivability under various environmental conditions.

Title: The impact of chlorine and heat on the infectivity and physicochemical properties of bacteriophage MS2.
Abstract: Enteric viruses and bacteriophages are exposed to various inactivating factors outside their host, and among them chlorine and heat are the most commonly used sanitizer in water industry and treatment in the food industry, respectively. Using MS2 phages as models for enteric viruses, we investigated the impact of free chlorine and heat on their physicochemical properties. Free chlorine was first evaluated alone. No increase in either capsid permeability or hydrophobicity was observed. The negative surface charge slightly increased suggesting molecular changes in the capsid. However, a weakening of the capsid by chlorine was suggested by differential scanning fluorimetry. This phenomenon was confirmed when chlorination was followed by a heat treatment. Indeed, an increase in the inactivation of MS2 phages and the permeability of their capsids to RNases was observed. More interestingly, an increase in the expression of hydrophobic domains at the phage surface was observed, but only for phages remaining infectious. The chlorine-caused weakening of the capsid suggested that, for an optimal use, the oxidant should be followed by heat. The increased permeability to RNases and the expression of hydrophobic domains may contribute to the development or improvement of molecular methods specific for infectious enteric viruses.

Title: Dual Surface Modification of Genome-Free MS2 Capsids for Delivery Applications.
Abstract: One of the hallmarks of virus-like particles (VLPs) is the fact that they possess distinguishable interior and exterior surfaces. Taking advantage of our knowledge of the amino acid location from X-ray crystal structures, we have developed a series of synthetic modifications of the MS2 bacteriophage viral capsid, including small molecule and polymer attachment, as well as conjugation with peptides, DNA and other proteins.

Abstract: The use of antibody conjugates for biomedical applications has garnered increased attention due to the ability of antibodies to specifically engage targets of interest. Despite these appealing qualities, the preparation of antibody-protein conjugates remains challenging. Here we detail an approach to attaching targeting antibodies to proteins of interest that combines advances in genetic code expansion and an efficient bioconjugation strategy. As an example, we prepare bacteriophage MS2 viral capsids bearing antibodies on their surfaces for applications in molecular targeting. This technique provides a modular framework to easily prepare antibody-MS2 conjugates in an efficient manner, even at low concentrations of the reacting biomolecules.

Title: Immunogenicity evaluation of MS2 phage-mediated chimeric nanoparticle displaying an immunodominant B cell epitope of foot-and-mouth disease virus.
Abstract: Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious disease of cloven-hoofed animals that has caused tremendous economic losses worldwide. In this study, we designed a chimeric nanoparticles (CNPs) vaccine that displays the predominant epitope of the serotype O foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) VP1 131-160 on the surface of MS2 phage. The recombinant protein was expressed in <i>Escherichia Coli</i> and can self-assemble into CNPs with diameter at 25-30 nm <i>in vitro</i>. A tandem repeat peptide epitopes (TRE) was prepared as control. Mice were immunized with CNPs, TRE and commercialized synthetic peptide vaccines (PepVac), respectively. The ELISA results showed that CNPs stimulated a little higher specific antibody levels to PepVac, but was significantly higher than the TRE groups. Moreover, the results from specific IFN-γ responses and lymphocyte proliferation test indicated that CNP immunized mice exhibited significantly enhanced cellular immune response compared to TRE. These results suggested that the CNPs constructed in current study could be a potential alternative vaccine in future FMDV control.

Title: Infectivity reduction efficacy of UV irradiation and peracetic acid-UV combined treatment on MS2 bacteriophage and murine norovirus in secondary wastewater effluent.
Abstract: Peracetic acid (PAA) is a strong oxidant/bactericide that has been applied in various industries (e.g., food processing, pharmaceuticals, medical device sterilization, etc.) as a disinfectant. There is increasing interest in using PAA for wastewater disinfection because it does not form halogenated byproducts, and no post-treatment quenching is required. Previous studies have demonstrated good efficiency in controlling bacteria in wastewater, but limited information is available for viruses, especially those hosted by mammals (e.g., norovirus). Therefore, a study on the infectivity reduction of murine norovirus (MNV) was undertaken to evaluate the disinfection efficacy of PAA or UV alone and in combination with UV irradiation in undisinfected secondary effluent from a municipal wastewater reclamation facility (MWW) and phosphate buffer solution (PBS) at pH 7. Experiments employing MS2 bacteriophage were also performed in parallel for comparison purposes. MS2 infectivity reduction was found to be lower than MNV infectivity reduction for each condition studied - PAA, PAA + UV, and UV disinfection. These data suggest that MS2 may not be an appropriate surrogate to accurately predict the reduction of MNV infectivity. UV irradiation, in a dose range of 5-250 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>, provided linear log inactivation (-log (N/N<sub>0</sub>)) with a regression slope (cm<sup>2</sup>mJ<sup>-1</sup>) of 0.031-0.034 and 0.165-0.202 for MS2 and MNV, respectively. UV irradiation provided similar inactivation for MS2 and MNV in both suspensions (PBS or MWW). Low infectivity reduction of MS2 was observed when PAA was used alone at a practical dose of 1.5 mg/L and below. A greater reduction of both MNV and MS2 was observed in PAA disinfection experiments using PBS as the microbial suspension medium, than in secondary effluent. Similar results were observed in PAA + UV experiments, in which greater synergistic effects were found in PBS than in MWW. Results of OH radical formation experiments suggest the presence of radical scavengers in MWW, which resulted in less opportunity for MNV and MS2 to encounter OHradicals. This study also demonstrated that the type of water can have a substantial impact on wastewater disinfection when employing PAA or PAA + UV treatment due to the matrix effect and the presence of radical scavengers, respectively. The results from this study could be employed to aid in the conceptual design of PAA and UV disinfection facilities, especially when norovirus is the organism of concern.

Title: Smartphone-Based in-Gel Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (gLAMP) System Enables Rapid Coliphage MS2 Quantification in Environmental Waters.
Abstract: Model coliphages (e.g., ΦX174, MS2, and PRD1) have been widely used as surrogates to study the fate and transport of pathogenic viruses in the environment and during wastewater treatment. Two groups of coliphages (F-specific and somatic) are being explored as indicators of viral fecal pollution in ambient water. However, the detection and quantification of coliphages still largely rely on time-consuming culture-based plaque assays. In this study, we developed an in-gel loop-mediated isothermal amplification (gLAMP) system enabling coliphage MS2 quantification within 30 min using standard laboratory devices. Viral particles (MS2) were immobilized with LAMP reagents in polyethylene glycol hydrogel, and then viral RNAs were amplified through a LAMP reaction. Due to the restriction effect of the hydrogel matrix, one viral particle would only produce one amplicon dot. Therefore, the sample virus concentrations can be determined based on the number of fluorescent amplicon dots using a smartphone for imaging. The method was validated by using artificially spiked and naturally contaminated water samples. gLAMP results were shown to correlate well with plaque assay counts ( R<sup>2</sup> = 0.984, p < 0.05) and achieved similar sensitivity to quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR; 1 plaque-forming unit per reaction). Moreover, gLAMP demonstrated a high level of tolerance against inhibitors naturally present in wastewater, in which RT-qPCR was completely inhibited. Besides MS2, gLAMP can also be used for the quantification of other microbial targets (e.g., Escherichia coli and Salmonella). Considering its simplicity, sensitivity, rapidity, and versatility, gLAMP holds great potential for microbial water-quality analysis, especially in resource-limited settings.

Title: Effect of μM Fe addition, mild heat and solar UV on sulfate radical-mediated inactivation of bacteria, viruses, and micropollutant degradation in water.
Abstract: In this work, solar disinfection (SODIS) was enhanced by moderate addition of Fe and sodium peroxydisulfate (PDS), under solar light. A systematic assessment of the activating factors was performed, firstly isolated, then in pairs and concluded in the combined Fe/heat/solar UV-PDS activation process. Solar light was the most effective (single) activator, and its combination with Fe and heat (double activation) yielded high level of synergies (up to S = 2.13). The triple activation was able to reduce the bacterial load up to 6-log in less than 1 h, similarly to the photo-Fenton process done in comparison (SODIS alone: >5 h). Fe-oxides were suitable activators of PDS under the same conditions while the presence of organic matter enhanced bacterial inactivation by the triple activated PDS process. The degradation of a (selected) mixture of micropollutants (i.e. drugs, pesticides) was also achieved in similar order of magnitude, and faster than the photo-Fenton process. Finally, the removal of a viral pathogen indicator (MS2 bacteriophage) was attained at minute-range residence times. The aforementioned facts indicate the suitability of the mild, combined process, as a potential SODIS enhancement, producing safe drinking water for sunny and especially for developing countries.

Title: MRI compatible MS2 nanoparticles designed to cross the blood-brain-barrier: providing a path towards tinnitus treatment.
Abstract: Fundamental challenges of targeting specific brain regions for treatment using pharmacotherapeutic nanoparticle (NP) carriers include circumventing the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and tracking delivery. Angiopep-2 (AP2) has been shown to facilitate the transport of large macromolecules and synthetic nanoparticles across the BBB. Thus, conjugation of AP2 to an MS2 bacteriophage based NP should also permit transport across the BBB. We have fabricated and tested a novel MS2 capsid-based NP conjugated to the ligand AP2. The reaction efficiency was determined to be over 70%, with up to two angiopep-2 conjugated per MS2 capsid protein. When linked with a porphyrin ring, manganese (Mn<sup>2+</sup>) remained stable within MS2 and was MRI detectable. Nanoparticles were introduced intracerebroventricularly or systemically. Systemic delivery yielded dose dependent, non-toxic accumulation of NPs in the midbrain. Design of a multifunctional MRI compatible NP platform provides a significant step forward for the diagnosis and treatment of intractable brain conditions, such as tinnitus.

Title: Quantitative characterization of all single amino acid variants of a viral capsid-based drug delivery vehicle.
Abstract: Self-assembling proteins are critical to biological systems and industrial technologies, but predicting how mutations affect self-assembly remains a significant challenge. Here, we report a technique, termed SyMAPS (Systematic Mutation and Assembled Particle Selection), that can be used to characterize the assembly competency of all single amino acid variants of a self-assembling viral structural protein. SyMAPS studies on the MS2 bacteriophage coat protein revealed a high-resolution fitness landscape that challenges some conventional assumptions of protein engineering. An additional round of selection identified a previously unknown variant (CP[T71H]) that is stable at neutral pH but less tolerant to acidic conditions than the wild-type coat protein. The capsids formed by this variant could be more amenable to disassembly in late endosomes or early lysosomes-a feature that is advantageous for delivery applications. In addition to providing a mutability blueprint for virus-like particles, SyMAPS can be readily applied to other self-assembling proteins.

Title: Transport of bacteriophage MS2 and PRD1 in saturated dune sand under suboxic conditions.
Abstract: Soil passage of (pretreated) surface water to remove pathogenic microorganisms is a highly efficient process under oxic conditions, reducing microorganism concentrations about 8 log<sup>10</sup> within tens of meters. However, under anoxic conditions, it has been shown that removal of microorganisms can be limited very much. Setback distances for adequate protection of natural groundwater may, therefore, be too short if anoxic conditions apply. Because removal of microorganisms under suboxic conditions is unknown, this research investigated removal of bacteriophage MS2 and PRD1 by soil passage under suboxic conditions at field scale. At the field location (dune area), one injection well and six monitoring wells were installed at different depths along three suboxic flow lines, where oxygen concentrations ranged from 0.4 to 1.7 mg/l and nitrate concentrations ranged from 13 to 16 mg/L. PRD1 and MS2 were injected directly at the corresponding depths and their removal in each flow line was determined. The highest bacteriophage removal was observed in the top layer, with about 9 log removal of MS2, and 7 log removal of PRD1 after 16 meters of aquifer transport. Less removal was observed at 12 m below surface, probably due to a higher groundwater velocity in this coarser grained layer. MS2 was removed more effectively than PRD1 under all conditions. Due to short travel times, inactivation of the phages was limited and the reported log removal was mainly associated with attachment of phages to the aquifer matrix. This study shows that attachment of MS2 and PRD1 is similar for oxic and suboxic sandy aquifers, and, therefore, setback distances used for sandy aquifers under oxic and suboxic conditions provide a similar level of safety. Sticking efficiency and the attachment rate coefficient, as measures for virus attachment, were evaluated as a function of the physico-chemical conditions.

Title: Inactivation of filter bound aerosolized MS2 bacteriophages using a non-conductive ultrasound transducer.
Abstract: The inactivation of viruses that retain their infectivity when transmitted through the air is challenging. To address this issue, this study used a non-contact ultrasound transducer (NCUT) to generate shock waves in the air at specific distances, input voltages, and exposure durations, targeting bacteriophage virus aerosols captured on to H14 HEPA filters. Initially, a frequency of 27.56 kHz (50V) at 25-mm distance was used, which yielded an inactivation efficiency of up to 32.69 ± 12.10%. Other frequencies at shorter distances were investigated, where 29.10 kHz had the highest inactivation efficiency (up to 81.95 ± 9.79% at 8.5-mm distance and 100 V). Longer exposure times also influenced virus inactivation, but the results were inconclusive because the NCUT overheated with time. Overall, NCUT appears to be a promising method for inactivating virus aerosols that may be safer than other forms of inactivation, which can cause genetic mutations or produce dangerous by-products.

Title: Evaluation of virus reduction at a large-scale wastewater reclamation plant by detection of indigenous F-specific RNA bacteriophage genotypes.
Abstract: Evaluating the reduction of virus load in water reclamation plants is important to ensuring the hygienic safety of the reclaimed water. A virus-spiking test is usually used to estimate virus reduction but is not practicable at large-scale plants. Thus, we evaluated virus reduction by ultrafiltration (UF) plus ultraviolet (UV) irradiation at a large-scale reclamation plant (1000 m<sup>3</sup>/d) by quantifying indigenous F-specific RNA bacteriophages (FRNAPHs). To detect the infectious FRNAPH, we used both plaque assay and integrated culture-reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction combined with the most probable number assay, which can detect infectious FRNAPH genotypes. For comparison, we determined reductions of indigenous FRNAPHs and spiked MS2 at a small-scale pilot plant (10 m<sup>3</sup>/d) at the same time. Reductions by UF were not significantly different among the bacteriophages at pilot plants. This result suggests that indigenous bacteriophages could be used for evaluating virus reduction by UF at large-scale plants. Indigenous Genotype I (GI) FRNAPH showed the highest UV resistance, followed by GII, GIII, and GIV. The resistance of GI-FRNAPH was equivalent to that of spiked MS2. The reduction of the total infectious FRNAPHs determined by plaque assay was affected by the predominant FRNAPH genotype, presumably because of their different UV resistances. Our results reveal that indigenous GI-FRNAPH can be a good alternative indicator to spiked MS2 in view of virus reduction during water reclamation.

Title: Assessing Viral Transfer During Doffing of Ebola-Level Personal Protective Equipment in a Biocontainment Unit.
Abstract: Personal protective equipment (PPE) protects healthcare workers (HCWs) caring for patients with Ebola virus disease (EVD), and PPE doffing is a critical point for preventing viral self-contamination. We assessed contamination of skin, gloves, and scrubs after doffing Ebola-level PPE contaminated with surrogate viruses: bacteriophages MS2 and Φ6.

Title: Removal of Waterborne Pathogen by Nanomaterial-Membrane Coupling System.
Abstract: The waterborne pathogenic viruses threaten human health. And the nanomaterial-membrane coupling system is promising in virus removal. In this study, phage MS2 was selected as the model virus to investigate the removal of virus with the coupling system. Results revealed that commercial nano TiO2 (Degussa Aeroxide P25) showed both of excellent adsorption and photocatalysis performance for virus removal compared with nano ZnO, nano Fe3O4, carbon nanotube, graphene, nano Ni and Nano TiO2 (anatase). In P25 photocatalysis process, the removal efficiency of phage MS2 increased with the increase of P25 concentration (0~1000 mg L-1), virus initial concentration (102~106 PFU mL-1), UV irradiation doses (5~120 mJ cm-2) and UV light intensity (0.126~0.742 mW cm-2). However, when the P25 concentration increased to over 1000 mg L-1, the virus removal efficiency would remain stable with the increase of P25 concentration. The nanomaterial-membrane coupling system showed excellent performance for virus removal, which was mainly attributed to the adsorption and photocatalysis of P25, and the intercept of membrane. When the P25 concentration was 100 mg L-1, UV irradiation dose was 20 mJ cm-2 and transmembrane pressure was 20 kPa, the phage MS2 removal efficiency could be up to 100%.

Title: Charge, size distribution and hydrophobicity of viruses: Effect of propagation and purification methods.
Abstract: Two virus propagation methods (in broth and on double agar overlay) and three purification procedures (PEG precipitation, centrifugal diafiltration and CsCl density gradient centrifugation) were comparatively evaluated using MS2 and P22 bacteriophages as model viruses. The prepared stocks were characterized in terms of electrophoretic mobility as a function of pH, particle size distribution, surface tension components and the overall hydrophobicity of the virus, as well as the percentage of infectious and total virus recovered. The obtained data were used to rank the purification methods according to six criteria of likely practical relevance. Regardless of the purification method applied, virus propagation in broth media resulted in higher purity virus stocks as the growth on double agar overlay introduced difficult-to-remove residual agar. CsCl density gradient centrifugation gave the highest quality bacteriophage suspensions, recovered infectious P22 at least as efficiently as the other two purification methods and selected for intact P22 virions over damaged ones. The impurities remaining in the virus suspension after PEG precipitation and centrifugal diafiltration broadened the size distribution and interfered with electrophoretic mobility measurements. The residual impurities had a major impact on the free energy of virus-virus interfacial interaction (the quantitative measure of virus hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity) leading to an incorrect determination of P22 bacteriophage as hydrophilic. The trends in measured physicochemical properties can be rationalized by considering impurity-coated virions as permeable soft particles.

Title: Unstructured 5'-tails act through ribosome standby to override inhibitory structure at ribosome binding sites.
Abstract: Initiation is the rate-limiting step in translation. It is well-known that stable structure at a ribosome binding site (RBS) impedes initiation. The ribosome standby model of de Smit and van Duin, based on studies of the MS2 phage coat cistron, proposed how high translation rates can be reconciled with stable, inhibitory structures at an RBS. Here, we revisited the coat protein system and assessed the translation efficiency from its sequestered RBS by introducing standby mutations. Further experiments with gfp reporter constructs assessed the effects of 5'-tails-as standby sites-with respect to length and sequence contributions. In particular, combining in vivo and in vitro assays, we can show that tails of CA-dinucleotide repeats-and to a lesser extent, AU-repeats-dramatically increase translation rates. Tails of increasing length reach maximal rate-enhancing effects at 16-18 nucleotides. These standby tails are single-stranded and do not exert their effect by structure changes in the neighboring RBS stem-loop. In vitro translation and toeprinting assays furthermore demonstrate that standby effects are exerted at the level of translation initiation. Finally, as expected, destabilizing mutations within the coat RBS indicate an interplay with the effects of standby tails.

Title: Effect of the Shellfish Proteinase K Digestion Method on Norovirus Capsid Integrity.
Abstract: Norovirus outbreaks are associated with the consumption of contaminated shellfish, and so efficient methods to recover and detect infectious norovirus in shellfish are important. The Proteinase K digestion method used to recover norovirus from shellfish, as described in the ISO 15216, would be a good candidate but its impact on the virus capsid integrity and thus infectivity was never examined. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the Proteinase K digestion method, and of the heat treatment component of the method alone, on norovirus (genogroups I and II) and MS2 bacteriophage capsid integrity. A slightly modified version of the ISO method was used. RT-qPCR was used for virus detection following digestion of accessible viral RNA using RNases. MS2 phage infectivity was measured using a plaque assay. The effect of shellfish digestive glands (DG) on recovery was evaluated. In the presence of shellfish DG, a reduction in MS2 phage infectivity of about 1 log<sub>10</sub> was observed after the Proteinase K digestion method and after heat treatment component alone. For norovirus GII and MS2 phage, there was no significant loss of genome following the Proteinase K digestion method but there was a significant 0.24 log<sub>10</sub> loss of norovirus GI. In the absence of shellfish DG, the reduction in MS2 phage infectivity was about 2 log<sub>10</sub>, with the addition of RNases resulting in a significant loss of genome for all tested viruses following complete Proteinase K digestion method and the heat treatment alone. While some protective effect from the shellfish DG on viruses was observed, the impact on capsid integrity and infectivity suggests that this method, while suitable for norovirus genome detection, may not completely preserve virus infectivity.

Title: Immunization with phage virus-like particles displaying Zika virus potential B-cell epitopes neutralizes Zika virus infection of monkey kidney cells.
Abstract: Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that has re-emerged and is associated with many debilitating clinical manifestations. Research is currently being conducted to develop a prophylactic vaccine against the virus; however, there has not been any licensed ZIKV vaccine. Recent studies have identified potential B-cell epitopes (amino acids 241-259, 294-315, 317-327, 346-361, 377-388 and 421-437) on the envelope protein of ZIKV, which could be explored to develop peptide vaccines against ZIKV infection. Nevertheless, the immunogenicity of these epitopes has never been assessed. Here, we displayed these epitopes on highly immunogenic bacteriophage virus-like particles (VLPs; MS2, PP7 and Qβ) platforms and assessed their immunogenicity in mice. Mice immunized with a mixture of VLPs displaying ZIKV envelope B-cell epitopes elicited anti-ZIKV antibodies. Although, immunized mice were not protected against a high challenge dose of ZIKV, sera - albeit at low titers - from immunized mice neutralized (in vitro) a low dose of ZIKV. Taken together, these results show that these epitopes are B-cell epitopes and they are immunogenic when displayed on a Qβ VLP platform. Furthermore, the results also show that immunization with VLPs displaying a single B-cell epitope minimally reduces ZIKV infection whereas immunization with a mixture of VLPs displaying a combination of the B-cell epitopes neutralizes ZIKV infection. Thus, immunization with a mixture of VLPs displaying multiple ZIKV B-cell epitopes is a good strategy to enhance ZIKV neutralization.

Title: Microbial inactivation and cytotoxicity evaluation of UV irradiated coconut water in a novel continuous flow spiral reactor.
Abstract: A continuous-flow UV reactor operating at 254nm wave-length was used to investigate inactivation of microorganisms including bacteriophage in coconut water, a highly opaque liquid food. UV-C inactivation kinetics of two surrogate viruses (MS2, T1UV) and three bacteria (E. coli ATCC 25922, Salmonella Typhimurium ATCC 13311, Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19115) in buffer and coconut water were investigated (D<sub>10</sub> values ranging from 2.82 to 4.54mJ·cm<sup>-2</sup>). A series of known UV-C doses were delivered to the samples. Inactivation levels of all organisms were linearly proportional to UV-C dose (r<sup>2</sup>>0.97). At the highest dose of 30mJ·cm<sup>-2</sup>, the three pathogenic organisms were inactivated by >5 log<sub>10</sub> (p<0.05). Results clearly demonstrated that UV-C irradiation effectively inactivated bacteriophage and pathogenic microbes in coconut water. The inactivation kinetics of microorganisms were best described by log linear model with a low root mean square error (RMSE) and high coefficient of determination (r<sup>2</sup>>0.97). Models for predicting log reduction as a function of UV-C irradiation dose were found to be significant (p<0.05) with low RMSE and high r<sup>2</sup>. The irradiated coconut water showed no cytotoxic effects on normal human intestinal cells and normal mouse liver cells. Overall, these results indicated that UV-C treatment did not generate cytotoxic compounds in the coconut water. This study clearly demonstrated that high levels of inactivation of pathogens can be achieved in coconut water, and suggested potential method for UV-C treatment of other liquid foods.

Title: Kinetics of Inactivation of Waterborne Enteric Viruses by Ozone.
Abstract: Ozone is an effective disinfectant against all types of waterborne pathogens. However, accurate and quantitative kinetic data regarding virus inactivation by ozone are scarce, because of the experimental challenges associated with the high reactivity of ozone toward viruses. Here, we established an experimental batch system that allows tailoring and quantifying of very low ozone exposures and simultaneously measuring virus inactivation. Second-order ozone inactivation rate constants (k<sub>O<sub>3</sub>-virus</sub>) of five enteric viruses [laboratory and two environmental strains of coxsackievirus B5 (CVF, CVEnv1, and CVEnv2), human adenovirus (HAdV), and echovirus 11 (EV)] and four bacteriophages (MS2, Qβ, T4, and Φ174) were measured in buffered solutions. The k<sub>O<sub>3</sub>-virus</sub> values of all tested viruses ranged from 4.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> to 3.3 × 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. For MS2, k<sub>O<sub>3</sub>-MS2</sub> depended only weakly on temperature (2-22 °C; E<sub>a</sub> = 22.2 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>) and pH (6.5-8.5), with an increase in k<sub>O<sub>3</sub>-MS2</sub> with increasing pH. The susceptibility of the selected viruses toward ozone decreases in the following order: Qβ > CVEnv2 > EV ≈ MS2 > Φ174 ≈ T4 > HAdV > CVF ≈ CVEnv1. On the basis of the measured k<sub>O<sub>3</sub>-Virus</sub> and typical ozone exposures applied in water and wastewater treatment, we conclude that ozone is a highly effective disinfectant for virus control.

Title: Cell-free TXTL synthesis of infectious bacteriophage T4 in a single test tube reaction.
Abstract: The bottom-up construction of biological entities from genetic information provides a broad range of opportunities to better understand fundamental processes within living cells, as well as holding great promise for the development of novel biomedical applications. Cell-free transcription-translation (TXTL) systems have become suitable platforms to tackle such topics because they recapitulate the process of gene expression. TXTL systems have advanced to where the <i>in vitro</i> construction of viable, complex, self-assembling deoxyribonucleic acid-programmed biological entities is now possible. Previously, we demonstrated the cell-free synthesis of three bacteriophages from their genomes: MS2, ΦX174, T7. In this work, we present the complete synthesis of the phage T4 from its 169-kbp genome in one-pot TXTL reactions. This achievement, for one of the largest coliphages, demonstrates the integration of complex gene regulation, metabolism and self-assembly, and brings the bottom-up synthesis of biological systems to a new level.

Title: Compactness of viral genomes: effect of disperse and localized random mutations.
Abstract: Genomes of single-stranded RNA viruses have evolved to optimize several concurrent properties. One of them is the architecture of their genomic folds, which must not only feature precise structural elements at specific positions, but also allow for overall spatial compactness. The latter was shown to be disrupted by random synonymous mutations, a disruption which can consequently negatively affect genome encapsidation. In this study, we use three mutation schemes with different degrees of locality to mutate the genomes of phage MS2 and Brome Mosaic virus in order to understand the observed sensitivity of the global compactness of their folds. We find that mutating local stretches of their genomes' sequence or structure is less disruptive to their compactness compared to inducing randomly-distributed mutations. Our findings are indicative of a mechanism for the conservation of compactness acting on a global scale of the genomes, and have several implications for understanding the interplay between local and global architecture of viral RNA genomes.

Title: Identification and functional characterization of type II toxin/antitoxin systems in Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.
Abstract: Type II toxin/antitoxin (TA) systems contribute to the formation of persister cells and biofilm formation for many organisms. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans thrives in the complex oral microbial community subjected to continual environmental flux. Little is known regarding the presence and function of type II TA systems in this organism or their contribution to adaptation and persistence in the biofilm. We identified 11 TA systems that are conserved across all seven serotypes of A. actinomycetemcomitans and represent the RelBE, MazEF and HipAB families of type II TA systems. The systems selectively responded to various environmental conditions that exist in the oral cavity. Two putative RelBE-like TA systems, D11S_1194-1195 and D11S_1718-1719 were induced in response to low pH and deletion of D11S_1718-1719 significantly reduced metabolic activity of stationary phase A. actinomycetemcomitans cells upon prolonged exposure to acidic conditions. The deletion mutant also exhibited reduced biofilm biomass when cultured under acidic conditions. The D11S_1194 and D11S_1718 toxin proteins inhibited in vitro translation of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and degraded ribosome-associated, but not free, MS2 virus RNA. In contrast, the corresponding antitoxins (D11S_1195 and D11S_1719), or equimolar mixtures of toxin and antitoxin, had no effect on DHFR production or RNA degradation. Together, these results suggest that D11S_1194-1195 and D11S_1718-1719 are RelBE-like type II TA systems that are activated under acidic conditions and may function to cleave ribosome-associated mRNA to inhibit translation in A. actinomycetemcomitans. In vivo, these systems may facilitate A. actinomycetemcomitans adaptation and persistence in acidic local environments in the dental biofilm.

Title: Analogies and differences among bacterial and viral disinfection by the photo-Fenton process at neutral pH: a mini review.
Abstract: Over the last years, the photo-Fenton process has been established as an effective, green alternative to chemical disinfection of waters and wastewaters. Microorganisms' inactivation is the latest success story in the application of this process at near-neutral pH, albeit without clearly elucidated inactivation mechanisms. In this review, the main pathways of the combined photo-Fenton process against the most frequent pathogen models (Escherichia coli for bacteria and MS2 bacteriophage for viruses) are analyzed. Firstly, the action of solar light is described and the specific inactivation mechanisms in bacteria (internal photo-Fenton) and viruses (genome damage) are presented. The contribution of the external pathways due to the potential presence of organic matter in generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and their effects on microorganism inactivation are discussed. Afterwards, the effects of the gradual addition of Fe and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> are assessed and the differences among bacterial and viral inactivation are highlighted. As a final step, the simultaneous addition of both reagents induces the photo-Fenton in the bulk, focusing on the differences induced by the homogeneous or heterogeneous fraction of the process and the variation among the two respective targets. This work exploits the accumulated evidence on the mechanisms of bacterial inactivation and the scarce ones towards viral targets, aiming to bridge this knowledge gap and make possible the further application of the photo-Fenton process in the field of water/wastewater treatment.

Title: Solar Photothermal Disinfection using Broadband-Light Absorbing Gold Nanoparticles and Carbon Black.
Abstract: A simple heat treatment, perhaps the most globally recognized point-of-use water sterilization method, is seemingly effective against all major pathogens of concern, but bulk water boiling is not energy efficient or sustainable. Herein, we present the first application of solar-to-thermal converting nanomaterials for the direct inactivation of bacteria and viruses in drinking water through the application of Au nanorods, carbon black, and Au nanorod-carbon black composite materials as light absorbers. With broad absorption bands spanning the visible and near-infrared wavelengths, at sufficient concentrations, these nanoparticles induce multiple scattering events, increasing photon absorption probability and concentrating the light within a small spatial domain, leading to localized, intense heating that inactivates microorganisms in close proximity. Moving toward practical device design, we have developed a facile silane immobilization approach to fabricate films with densely packed layers of photothermal nanomaterials. Our results suggest that upon irraditaion with simulated solar light, these films can thermally inactivate bacteria and viruses, as demonstrated through the inactivation of surrogate organisms Escherichia coli K-12, and bacteriophages MS2 and PR772.

Title: One-plasmid double-expression His-tag system for rapid production and easy purification of MS2 phage-like particles.
Abstract: MS2 phage-like particles (MS2 PLP) are artificially constructed pseudo-viral particles derived from bacteriophage MS2. They are able to carry a specific single stranded RNA (ssRNA) sequence of choice inside their capsid, thus protecting it against the effects of ubiquitous nucleases. Such particles are able to mimic ssRNA viruses and, thus, may serve as the process control for molecular detection and quantification of such agents in several kinds of matrices, vaccines and vaccine candidates, drug delivery systems, and systems for the display of immunologically active peptides or nanomachines. Currently, there are several different in vivo plasmid-driven packaging systems for production of MS2 PLP. In order to combine all the advantages of the available systems and to upgrade and simplify the production and purification of MS2 PLP, a one-plasmid double-expression His-tag system was designed. The described system utilizes a unique fusion insertional mutation enabling purification of particles using His-tag affinity. Using this new production system, highly pure MS2 PLP can be quickly produced and purified by a fast performance liquid chromatography (FPLC) approach. The system can be easily adapted to produce other MS2 PLP with different properties.

Title: Photodynamic inactivation of bacteriophage MS2: The A-protein is the target of virus inactivation.
Abstract: Singlet oxygen mediated oxidation has been shown to be responsible for photodynamic inactivation (PDI) of viruses in solution with photosensitisers such as 5, 10, 15, 20-tetrakis (1-methyl-4-pyridinio) porphyrin tetra p-toluenesulfonate (TMPyP). The capsids of non-enveloped viruses, such as bacteriophage MS2, are possible targets for viral inactivation by singlet oxygen oxidation. Within the capsid (predominantly composed of coat protein), the A-protein acts as the host recognition and attachment protein. The A-protein has two domains; an α-helix domain and a β-sheet domain. The α-helix domain is attached to the viral RNA genome inside the capsid while the β-sheet domain, which is on the surface of the capsid, is believed to be the site for attachment to the host bacteria pilus during infection. In this study, 4 sequence-specific antibodies were raised against 4 sites on the A-protein. Changes induced by the oxidation of singlet oxygen were compared to the rate of PDI of the virus. Using these antibodies, our results suggest that the rate of PDI is relative to loss of antigenicity of two sites on the A-protein. Our data further showed that PDI caused aggregation of MS2 particles and crosslinking of MS2 coat protein. However, these inter- and intra-capsid changes did not correlate to the rate of PDI we observed in MS2. Possible modes of action are discussed as a means to gaining insight to the targets and mechanisms of PDI of viruses.

Title: Effects of solution chemistry on the sunlight inactivation of particles-associated viruses MS2.
Abstract: The inactivation efficacy of bacteriophage MS2 by simulated sunlight irradiation was investigated to understand the effects of MS2 aggregation and adsorption to particles in solutions with different components. Kaolinite and Microcystis aeruginosa were used as model inorganic and organic particles, respectively. Lower pH and di-valent ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) were main factors on the aggregation and inactivation of MS2. In the presence of both particles, there was no significant impact on the MS2 inactivation efficacy by kaolinite (10-200mM) or Microcystis aeruginosa (10<sup>2</sup>-10<sup>5</sup>Cells/mL) in 1mM NaCl at pH 7. However at lower pH 3, MS2 aggregates formed in the particle-free and kaolinite-containing solutions, caused lower inactivation since the outer viruses of aggregation protect the inner viruses. In addition, more MS2 adsorbed on Microcystis aeruginosa at lower pH (3 and 4). Microcystis aeruginosa would act as a potential photosensitizer for ROS production to inactivate the adsorbed MS2, since extracellular organic matter (EOM) of Microcystis aeruginosa was detected in this study, which has been reported to produce ROS under solar irradiation. At pH 7, Na<sup>+</sup> had no effect on the inactivation of MS2, because MS2 was stable and dispersed even at 200mM Na<sup>+</sup>. MS2 aggregated and adsorbed on particles even at 10mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and led to lower inactivation. Kaolinite cannot offer enough protection to adsorbed MS2 as aggregation and Microcystis aeruginosa acts as potential photosensitizer to produce ROS and inactivate the adsorbed MS2 at high concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In particle-free solution, SRNOM inhibited MS2 inactivation by shielding the sunlight and coating MS2 to increase its survival.

Title: Evaluation of the suitability of a plant virus, pepper mild mottle virus, as a surrogate of human enteric viruses for assessment of the efficacy of coagulation-rapid sand filtration to remove those viruses.
Abstract: Here, we evaluated the removal of three representative human enteric viruses - adenovirus (AdV) type 40, coxsackievirus (CV) B5, and hepatitis A virus (HAV) IB - and one surrogate of human caliciviruses - murine norovirus (MNV) type 1 - by coagulation-rapid sand filtration, using water samples from eight water sources for drinking water treatment plants in Japan. The removal ratios of a plant virus (pepper mild mottle virus; PMMoV) and two bacteriophages (MS2 and φX174) were compared with the removal ratios of human enteric viruses to assess the suitability of PMMoV, MS2, and φX174 as surrogates for human enteric viruses. The removal ratios of AdV, CV, HAV, and MNV, evaluated via the real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, were 0.8-2.5-log<sub>10</sub> when commercially available polyaluminum chloride (PACl, basicity 1.5) and virgin silica sand were used as the coagulant and filter medium, respectively. The type of coagulant affected the virus removal efficiency, but the age of silica sand used in the rapid sand filtration did not. Coagulation-rapid sand filtration with non-sulfated, high-basicity PACls (basicity 2.1 or 2.5) removed viruses more efficiently than the other aluminum-based coagulants. The removal ratios of MS2 were sometimes higher than those of the three human enteric viruses and MNV, whereas the removal ratios of φX174 tended to be smaller than those of the three human enteric viruses and MNV. In contrast, the removal ratios of PMMoV were similar to and strongly correlated with those of the three human enteric viruses and MNV. Thus, PMMoV appears to be a suitable surrogate for human enteric viruses for the assessment of the efficacy of coagulation-rapid sand filtration to remove viruses.

Title: Development of an efficient viral aerosol collector for higher sampling flow rate.
Abstract: Viral aerosol infection through cough generates large amounts of viral aerosol and can result in many adverse health effects such as influenza flu and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). To characterize the coughed viral aerosol, the sampler needs to sample at higher flow rate and possess high physical collection efficiency as well as high viral preservation. However, most current inertia-based high flow bioaerosol samplers are not suited for viral aerosol sampling since the viability will be lost doing the sampling process. Current condensation growth methods only have good physical collection efficiency and viral preservation at low flow rate (< 10 LPM). In this study, we developed a viral aerosol sampling system using a cooler and steam-jet aerosol collector (SJAC) for bioaerosol collection for the first time. The system is based on mixing condensation growth method and has high viral preservation at a higher flow rate (12.5 LPM). We control the inlet aerosol flow temperature and the SJAC mixing reservoir temperature to improve the physical collection efficiency and viability preservation of the viral aerosol. Results indicate that the physical collection efficiency is 70-99% for aerosol 30-100 nm when the aerosol flow and mixing reservoir temperature was 19 and 50 °C, respectively. In addition, the system was 7 and 22 times more efficient for viability preservation of MS2 bacteriophage than the commonly used All Glass Impinger 30 (AGI-30) and BioSampler®, respectively. Finally, the system can be applied to sample at a lower concentration (10<sup>5</sup> PFU/m<sup>3</sup>), and results shows the system was 4.7 times more efficient for viability preservation than using AGI-30 alone. The developed viral collection system will improve our understanding of the characteristics of coughed aerosol and can be used for future evaluation of respiratory protective equipment and environmental sampling.

Title: Virus Transfer at the Skin-Liquid Interface.
Abstract: Understanding virus transfer between liquid and skin is necessary to estimate transmission during water-related activities. Here, we modeled virus transfer from liquid-to-skin and skin-to-liquid. We performed human subject studies using three bacteriophages as pathogenic virus surrogates: nonenveloped MS2 and Qβ and enveloped Φ6. Our study shows that transfer from liquid-to-skin is describable by a single model based on (1) virus concentration and (2) volume of liquid remaining on skin. Contact times (0.1-30 min), and virus species had little-to-no influence on virus transfer. Likewise, liquid conditions (pH 6-9, ionic strength 10-550 mM) had no influence on transfer as shown for MS2. The model accounts for both, virus adsorbed onto the skin, and virus in the liquid retained on skin. In comparison, virus transfer from skin-to-liquid was influenced by the wetness of the skin and by liquid type (water, saliva). 90 ± 19% of the virus inoculated on the skin are transferred to the water when the skin remains wet compared to 30 ± 17% when the skin is dry. The transfer from skin-to-liquid was 41% higher when the recipient liquid was water as compared with saliva. This study quantifies virus transfer between liquid and skin and guides risk assessments of water-related activities.

Title: Cost-Effective and Handmade Paper-Based Immunosensing Device for Electrochemical Detection of Influenza Virus.
Abstract: Although many studies concerning the detection of influenza virus have been published, a paper-based, label-free electrochemical immunosensor has never been reported. Here, we present a cost-effective, handmade paper-based immunosensor for label-free electrochemical detection of influenza virus H1N1. This immunosensor was prepared by modifying paper with a spray of hydrophobic silica nanoparticles, and using stencil-printed electrodes. We used a glass vaporizer to spray the hydrophobic silica nanoparticles onto the paper, rendering it super-hydrophobic. The super-hydrophobicity, which is essential for this paper-based biosensor, was achieved via 30-40 spray coatings, corresponding to a 0.39-0.41 mg cm<sup>-2</sup> coating of nanoparticles on the paper and yielding a water contact angle of 150° ± 1°. Stencil-printed carbon electrodes modified with single-walled carbon nanotubes and chitosan were employed to increase the sensitivity of the sensor, and the antibodies were immobilized via glutaraldehyde cross-linking. Differential pulse voltammetry was used to assess the sensitivity of the sensors at various virus concentrations, ranging from 10 to 10⁴ PFU mL<sup>-1</sup>, and the selectivity was assessed against MS2 bacteriophages and the influenza B viruses. These immunosensors showed good linear behaviors, improved detection times (30 min), and selectivity for the H1N1 virus with a limit of detection of 113 PFU mL<sup>-1</sup>, which is sufficiently sensitive for rapid on-site diagnosis. The simple and inexpensive methodologies developed in this study have great potential to be used for the development of a low-cost and disposable immunosensor for detection of pathogenic microorganisms, especially in developing countries.

Title: A Light-Activated Antimicrobial Surface Is Active Against Bacterial, Viral and Fungal Organisms.
Abstract: Evidence has shown that environmental surfaces play an important role in the transmission of nosocomial pathogens. Deploying antimicrobial surfaces in hospital wards could reduce the role environmental surfaces play as reservoirs for pathogens. Herein we show a significant reduction in viable counts of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and MS2 Bacteriophage after light treatment of a medical grade silicone incorporating crystal violet, methylene blue and 2 nm gold nanoparticles. Furthermore, a migration assay demonstrated that in the presence of light, growth of the fungus-like organism Pythium ultimum and the filamentous fungus Botrytis cinerea was inhibited. Atomic Force Microscopy showed significant alterations to the surface of S. epidermidis, and electron microscopy showed cellular aggregates connected by discrete surface linkages. We have therefore demonstrated that the embedded surface has a broad antimicrobial activity under white light and that the surface treatment causes bacterial envelope damage and cell aggregation.

Title: MS2 and Qβ bacteriophages reveal the contribution of surface hydrophobicity on the mobility of non-enveloped icosahedral viruses in SDS-based capillary zone electrophoresis.
Abstract: SDS is commonly employed as BGE additive in CZE analysis of non-enveloped icosahedral viruses. But the way by which SDS interacts with the surface of such viruses remains to date poorly known, making complicate to understand their behavior during a run. In this article, two related bacteriophages, MS2 and Qβ, are used as model to investigate the migration mechanism of non-enveloped icosahedral viruses in SDS-based CZE. Both phages are characterized by similar size and surface charge but significantly different surface hydrophobicity (Qβ > MS2, where '>' means 'more hydrophobic than'). By comparing their electrophoretic mobility in the presence or not of SDS on both sides of the CMC, we show that surface hydrophobicity of phages is a key factor influencing their mobility and that SDS-virus association is driven by hydrophobic interactions at the surface of virions. The CZE analyses of heated MS2 particles, which over-express hydrophobic domains at their surface, confirm this finding. The correlations between the present results and others from the literature suggest that the proposed mechanism might not be exclusive to the bacteriophages examined here.

Title: Trimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (TriFC) Assay for Direct Visualization of RNA-Protein Interaction <i>in planta</i>.
Abstract: RNA-Protein interactions play important roles in various eukaryotic biological processes. Molecular imaging of subcellular localization of RNA/protein complexes in plants is critical for understanding these interactions. However, methods to image RNA-Protein interactions in living plants have not yet been developed until now. Recently, we have developed a trimolecular fluorescence complementation (TriFC) system for <i>in vivo</i> visualization of RNA-Protein interaction by transient expression in tobacco leaves. In this method, we combined conventional bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) system with MS2 system (phage MS2 coat protein [MCP] and its binding RNA sequence [MS2 sequence]) ( Schonberger <i>et al.</i>, 2012 ). Target RNA is tagged with 6xMS2 and MCP and RNA binding protein are fused with YFP fragments. DNA constructs encoding such fusion RNA and proteins are infiltrated into tobacco leaves with <i>Agrobacterium</i> suspensions. RNA-Protein interaction <i>in vivo</i> is observed by confocal microscope.

Title: Removal of model viruses, E. coli and Cryptosporidium oocysts from surface water by zirconium and chitosan coagulants.
Abstract: The present work evaluates the effect of contact filtration, preceded by coagulation with zirconium (Zr) and chitosan coagulants, on model microorganisms and waterborne pathogens. River water intended for potable water production was spiked with MS2 and Salmonella Typhimurium 28B bacteriophages, Escherichia coli, and Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts prior to coagulation. The hygienic performance demonstrated by Zr comprised 3.0-4.0 log<sub>10</sub> removal of viruses and 5.0-6.0 log<sub>10</sub> removal of E. coli and C. parvum oocysts. Treatment with chitosan resulted in a removal of 2.5-3.0 log<sub>10</sub> of viruses and parasites, and 4.5-5.0 log<sub>10</sub> of bacteria. A reference coagulant, polyaluminium chloride (PACl), gave a 2.5-3.0 log<sub>10</sub> removal of viruses and 4.5 log<sub>10</sub> of E. coli. These results indicate that both Zr and chitosan enable adequate removal of microorganisms from surface water. The present study also attempts to assess removal rates of the selected microorganisms with regard to their size and surface properties. The isoelectric point of the Salmonella Typhimurium 28B bacteriophage is reported for the first time. The retention of the selected microorganisms in the filter bed appeared to have some correlation with their size, but the effect of the charge remained unclear.

Title: Differential MS2 Interaction with Food Contact Surfaces Determined by Atomic Force Microscopy and Virus Recovery.
Abstract: Enteric viruses are recognized as major etiologies of U.S. foodborne infections. These viruses are easily transmitted via food contact surfaces. Understanding virus interactions with surfaces may facilitate the development of improved means for their removal, thus reducing transmission. Using MS2 coliphage as a virus surrogate, the strength of virus adhesion to common food processing and preparation surfaces of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and glass was assessed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and virus recovery assays. The interaction forces of MS2 with various surfaces were measured from adhesion peaks in force-distance curves registered using a spherical bead probe preconjugated with MS2 particles. MS2 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) demonstrated approximately 5 times less adhesion force to glass (0.54 nN) than to PVC (2.87 nN) (<i>P</i> < 0.0001). This was consistent with the virus recovery data, which showed 1.4-fold fewer virus PFU recovered from PVC than from glass after identical inoculations and 24 h of cold storage. The difference in adhesion was ascribed to both intrinsic chemical characteristics and the substrate surface porosity (smooth glass versus porous PVC). Incorporating a surfactant micellar solution of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) into the PBS reduced the adhesion force for PVC (∼0 nN) and consistently increased virus recovery by 19%. With direct and indirect evidence of virus adhesion, this study illustrated a two-way assessment of virus adhesion for the initial evaluation of potential means to mitigate virus adhesion to food contact surfaces.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The spread of foodborne viruses is likely associated with their adhesive nature. Virus attachment on food contact surfaces has been evaluated by quantitating virus recoveries from inoculated surfaces. This study aimed to evaluate the microenvironment in which nanometer-sized viruses interact with food contact surfaces and to compare the virus adhesion differences using AFM. The virus surrogate MS2 demonstrated less adhesion force to glass than to PVC via AFM, with the force-contributing factors including the intrinsic nature and the topography of the contact surfaces. This adhesion finding is consistent with the virus recoveries, which were determined indirectly. Greater numbers of viruses were recovered from glass than from PVC, after application at the same levels. The stronger MS2 adhesion onto PVC could be interrupted by incorporating a surfactant during the interaction between the virus and the contact surface. This study increases our understanding of the virus adhesion microenvironment and indicates ways to mitigate virus adhesion onto contact surfaces.

Title: Comparative survival of viruses during thermophilic and mesophilic anaerobic digestion.
Abstract: Micro-scale technology was used to obtain survival data for three animal viruses and two bacteriophages during anaerobic digestion. The data for adenoviruses, MS2 and Φ6 provide the first published reports for survival of these viruses during mesophilic anaerobic digestion. Data were also obtained for thermophilic digestion, which showed greater inactivation of viruses at the higher temperature. Data on the survival of Φ6 are of particular interest since it is a lipid-based virus which has been suggested as a surrogate for the Ebola virus. In contrast, MS2 was found to be an inappropriate surrogate for Ebola.

Title: Evaluation of Chlorine Treatment Levels for Inactivation of Human Norovirus and MS2 Bacteriophage during Sewage Treatment.
Abstract: This study examined the inactivation of human norovirus (HuNoV) GI.1 and GII.4 by chlorine under conditions mimicking sewage treatment. Using a porcine gastric mucin-magnetic bead (PGM-MB) assay, no statistically significant loss in HuNoV binding (inactivation) was observed for secondary effluent treatments of ≤25 ppm total chlorine; for both strains, 50 and 100 ppm treatments resulted in ≤0.8-log<sub>10</sub> unit and ≥3.9-log<sub>10</sub> unit reductions, respectively. Treatments of 10, 25, 50, and 100 ppm chlorine inactivated 0.31, 1.35, >5, and >5 log<sub>10</sub> units, respectively, of the norovirus indicator MS2 bacteriophage. Evaluation of treatment time indicated that the vast majority of MS2 and HuNoV inactivation occurred in the first 5 min for 0.2-μm-filtered, prechlorinated secondary effluent. Free chlorine measurements of secondary effluent seeded with MS2 and HuNoV demonstrated substantial oxidative burdens. With 25, 50, and 100 ppm treatments, free chlorine levels after 5 min of exposure ranged from 0.21 to 0.58 ppm, from 0.28 to 16.7 ppm, and from 11.6 to 53 ppm, respectively. At chlorine treatment levels of >50 ppm, statistically significant differences were observed between reductions for PGM-MB-bound HuNoV (potentially infectious) particles and those for unbound (noninfectious) HuNoV particles or total norovirus particles. While results suggested that MS2 and HuNoV (measured as PGM-MB binding) behave similarly, although not identically, both have limited susceptibility to chlorine treatments of ≤25 ppm total chlorine. Since sewage treatment is performed at ≤25 ppm total chlorine, targeting free chlorine levels of 0.5 to 1.0 ppm, these results suggest that traditional chlorine-based sewage treatment does not inactivate HuNoV efficiently.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> HuNoV is ubiquitous in sewage. A receptor binding assay was used to assess inactivation of HuNoV by chlorine-based sewage treatment, given that the virus cannot be routinely propagated <i>in vitro</i> Results reported here indicate that chlorine treatment of sewage is not effective for inactivating HuNoV unless chlorine levels are above those routinely used for sewage treatment.

Title: A novel candidate HPV vaccine: MS2 phage VLP displaying a tandem HPV L2 peptide offers similar protection in mice to Gardasil-9.
Abstract: Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) cause approximately 5% of cancer cases worldwide. Fortunately, three prophylactic vaccines have been approved to protect against HPV infections. Gardasil-9, the most recent HPV vaccine, is predicted to offer protection against the HPV types that cause ∼90% of cervical cancer, 86% of HPV-associated penile cancers, and ∼93% of HPV-associated head & neck cancers. As an alternative to Gardasil-9, we developed and tested a novel candidate vaccine targeting conserved epitopes in the HPV minor capsid protein, L2. We displayed a tandem HPV31/16L2 peptide (amino acid 17-31) or consensus peptides from HPV L2 (amino acid 69-86 or 108-122) on the surface of bacteriophage MS2 virus-like particles (VLPs). Mice immunized with the MS2 VLPs displaying the tandem peptide or immunized with a mixture of VLPs (displaying the tandem peptide and consensus peptide 69-86) elicited high titer antibodies against individual L2 epitopes. Moreover, vaccinated mice were protected from cervicovaginal infection with HPV pseudoviruses 16, 31, 45, 58 and sera from immunized mice neutralized HPV pseudoviruses 18 and 33 at levels similar to mice immunized with Gardasil-9. These results suggest that immunization with a tandem, L2 peptide or a low valency mixture of L2 peptide-displaying VLPs can provide broad protection against multiple HPV types.

Title: Virucidal Influence of Ionic Liquids on Phages P100 and MS2.
Abstract: An increasing number of publications describe the potential of ionic liquids (ILs) as novel antimicrobials, antibacterial coatings and even as active pharmaceutical ingredients. Nevertheless, a major research area, notably their impact on viruses, has so far been neglected. Consequently the aim of this study was to examine the effects of ILs on the infectivity of viruses. A systematic analysis to investigate the effects of defined structural elements of ILs on virus activity was performed using 55 ILs. All structure activity relationships (SARs) were tested on the human norovirus surrogate phage MS2 and phage P100 representing non-enveloped DNA viruses. Results demonstrate that IL SAR conclusions, established for prokaryotes and eukaryotes, are not readily applicable to the examined phages. A virus-type-dependent IL influence was also apparent. Overall, four ILs, covering different structural elements, were found to reduce phage P100 infectivity by ≥4 log<sub>10</sub> units, indicating a virucidal effect, whereas the highest reduction for phage MS2 was about 3 log<sub>10</sub> units. Results indicate that future applications of ILs as virucidal agents will require development of novel SARs and the obtained results serve as a good starting point for future studies.

Title: Synthesis of Infectious Bacteriophages in an E. coli-based Cell-free Expression System.
Abstract: A new generation of cell-free transcription-translation (TXTL) systems, engineered to have a greater versatility and modularity, provide novel capabilities to perform basic and applied sciences in test tube reactions. Over the past decade, cell-free TXTL has become a powerful technique for a broad range of novel multidisciplinary research areas related to quantitative and synthetic biology. The new TXTL platforms are particularly useful to construct and interrogate biochemical systems through the execution of synthetic or natural gene circuits. In vitro TXTL has proven convenient to rapidly prototype regulatory elements and biological networks as well as to recapitulate molecular self-assembly mechanisms found in living systems. In this article, we describe how infectious bacteriophages, such as MS2 (RNA), ΦΧ174 (ssDNA), and T7 (dsDNA), are entirely synthesized from their genome in one-pot reactions using an all Escherichia coli, cell-free TXTL system. Synthesis of the three coliphages is quantified using the plaque assay. We show how the yield of synthesized phage depends on the biochemical settings of the reactions. Molecular crowding, emulated through a controlled concentration of PEG 8000, affects the amount of synthesized phages by orders of magnitudes. We also describe how to amplify the phages and how to purify their genomes. The set of protocols and results presented in this work should be of interest to multidisciplinary researchers involved in cell-free synthetic biology and bioengineering.

Title: Persistence of MS-2 Bacteriophage Within Eastern Oysters.
Abstract: Male-specific bacteriophages have been proposed as human enteric virus indicators for shellfish. In this study, Eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) were individually exposed to 5.6 × 10<sup>10</sup> PFU of MS-2 for 48 h at 15 °C followed by collective maintenance in continuously UV-sterilized seawater for 0-6 weeks at either 7, 15, or 24 °C. Initial contamination levels of MS-2 were >6 log PFU. Assessment of weekly declines of viable MS-2 indicated that cooler temperatures dramatically enhanced the persistence of MS-2 within oyster tissues. At 3 weeks, the average log PFU reductions for MS-2 within oysters were 2.28, 2.90, and 4.57 for oysters held at 7, 15, and 24 °C, respectively. Fitting temporal survival data with linear and nonlinear Weibull models indicated that the Weibull model best fit the observed reductions. In total, these data can serve as a guideline for regulatory agencies regarding the influence of water temperature on indicator phage after episodic sewage exposure.

Title: T7 RNA polymerase-driven inducible cell lysis for DNA transfer from Escherichia coli to Bacillus subtilis.
Abstract: The majority of the good DNA editing techniques have been developed in Escherichia coli; however, Bacillus subtilis is better host for a plethora of synthetic biology and biotechnology applications. Reliable and efficient systems for the transfer of synthetic DNA between E. coli and B. subtilis are therefore of the highest importance. Using synthetic biology approaches, such as streamlined lambda Red recombineering and Gibson Isothermal Assembly, we integrated genetic circuits pT7L123, Repr-ts-1 and pLT7pol encoding the lysis genes of bacteriophages MS2, ΦX174 and lambda, the thermosensitive repressor and the T7 RNA polymerase into the E. coli chromosome. In this system, T7 RNA polymerase regulated by the thermosensitive repressor drives the expression of the phage lysis genes. We showed that T7 RNA polymerase significantly increases efficiency of cell lysis and transfer of the plasmid and bacterial artificial chromosome-encoded DNA from the lysed E. coli into B. subtilis.

Title: Efficient inactivation of MS-2 virus in water by hydrodynamic cavitation.
Abstract: The aim of this study was to accurately quantify the impact of hydrodynamic cavitation on the infectivity of bacteriophage MS2, a norovirus surrogate, and to develop a small scale reactor for testing the effect of hydrodynamic cavitation on human enteric viruses, which cannot be easily prepared in large quantities. For this purpose, 3 mL scale and 1 L scale reactors were constructed and tested. Both devices were efficient in generating hydrodynamic cavitation and in reducing the infectivity of MS2 virus. Furthermore, they reached more than 4 logs reductions of viral infectivity, thus confirming the scalability of hydrodynamic cavitation for this particular application. As for the mechanism of page inactivation, we suspect that cavitation generated OH<sup>-</sup> radicals formed an advanced oxidation process, which could have damaged the host's recognition receptors located on the surface of the bacteriophage. Additional damage could arise from the high shear forces inside the cavity. Moreover, the effectiveness of the cavitation was higher for suspensions containing low initial viral titers that are in similar concentration to the ones found in real water samples. According to this, cavitation generators could prove to be a useful tool for treating virus-contaminated wastewaters in the future.

Title: High flow ceramic pot filters.
Abstract: Ceramic pot filters are considered safe, robust and appropriate technologies, but there is a general consensus that water revenues are limited due to clogging of the ceramic element. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential of high flow ceramic pot filters to produce more water without sacrificing their microbial removal efficacy. High flow pot filters, produced by increasing the rice husk content, had a higher initial flow rate (6-19 L h<sup>-1</sup>), but initial LRVs for E. coli of high flow filters was slightly lower than for regular ceramic pot filters. This disadvantage was, however, only temporarily as the clogging in high flow filters had a positive effect on the LRV for E. coli (from below 1 to 2-3 after clogging). Therefore, it can be carefully concluded that regular ceramic pot filters perform better initially, but after clogging, the high flow filters have a higher flow rate as well as a higher LRV for E. coli. To improve the initial performance of new high flow filters, it is recommended to further utilize residence time of the water in the receptacle, since additional E. coli inactivation was observed during overnight storage. Although a relationship was observed between flow rate and LRV of MS2 bacteriophages, both regular and high flow filters were unable to reach over 2 LRV.

Title: Disinfection of bacteriophage MS2 by copper in water.
Abstract: Households that lack piped water supply are often forced to meet water needs by storing in the home, leaving water vulnerable to contamination by viruses. Storage in copper containers can potentially prevent this type of contamination, but the inactivation kinetics of viruses by copper need to be described to make appropriate storage recommendations. This work characterized inactivation kinetics of bacteriophage MS2 as a surrogate for enteric viruses by dissolved ionic copper in water. Reduction of MS2 increased with increasing doses of copper. At 0.3 mg/L, there was a 1.8-log<sub>10</sub> reduction of MS2 within 6 h. At 1 and 3 mg/L, 2-2.5 log<sub>10</sub> inactivation could be achieved between 6 and 24 h. Parameters for the Chick-Watson, Hom, and One Hit-Two Population models of inactivation were calculated and evaluated, all of which demonstrated strong goodness-of-fit and predictability at various contact times. Copper inactivates MS2 under controlled conditions at doses between 0.3 and 3 mg/L. Although requiring longer contact times than conventional disinfectants, it is a candidate for improving the safety of stored drinking water.

Title: Effect of membrane property and feed water organic matter quality on long-term performance of the gravity-driven membrane filtration process.
Abstract: This study investigated the influence of membrane property and feed water organic matter quality on the permeate flux and water quality during gravity-driven membrane (GDM) filtration. GDM filtration was continuously carried out over 500 days at hydrostatic pressure of 65 mbar in dead-end mode without any back-flushing or membrane cleaning. Three ultrafiltration (UF) membranes (PES-100 kDa, PVDF-120 kDa, and PVDF-100 kDa) and one microfiltration (MF) membrane (PTFE-0.3 μm) were tested for treating lake water with varied organic matter qualities due to algal growth. The fluxes of the four membranes rapidly decreased to ~8 L/(m<sup>2</sup> × h) within a week of GDM filtration. The flux variations were quite similar for the four membranes during the entire GDM filtration, indicating that membrane property has a little effect on the flux. The flux strongly depends on the feed water organic matter quality. The average flux in treating low organics containing water (7-60 days) was ~5 L/(m<sup>2</sup> × h) and decreased to ~2 L/(m<sup>2</sup> × h) in treating high organics containing water (60-300 days). The accumulation of algal-derived biopolymers was mainly responsible for the flux decline by forming biofilms with high permeation resistance. The average flux in 300-500 days increased to ~3.5 L/(m<sup>2</sup> × h) when the feed water contained lower levels of biopolymers and higher levels of easily biodegradable organics, which created open and heterogeneous biofilms with lower permeation resistance. Removal efficiency for Escherichia coli was more than 5 log, while the removal efficiency for total bacterial cells was 1 log-2 log for the four membranes, indicating some bacterial regrowth after the filtration. Removal efficiency for the MS2 phage was 2.4 log and 1.5 log for the fouled PES-UF and PTFE-MF membranes.

Title: Mutational analysis of the MS2 lysis protein L.
Abstract: Small single-stranded nucleic acid phages effect lysis by expressing a single protein, the amurin, lacking muralytic enzymatic activity. Three amurins have been shown to act like 'protein antibiotics' by inhibiting cell-wall biosynthesis. However, the L lysis protein of the canonical ssRNA phage MS2, a 75 aa polypeptide, causes lysis by an unknown mechanism without affecting net peptidoglycan synthesis. To identify residues important for lytic function, randomly mutagenized alleles of L were generated, cloned into an inducible plasmid and the transformants were selected on agar containing the inducer. From a total of 396 clones, 67 were unique single base-pair changes that rendered L non-functional, of which 44 were missense mutants and 23 were nonsense mutants. Most of the non-functional missense alleles that accumulated in levels comparable to the wild-type allele are localized in the C-terminal half of L, clustered in and around an LS dipeptide sequence. The LS motif was used to align L genes from ssRNA phages lacking any sequence similarity to MS2 or to each other. This alignment revealed a conserved domain structure, in terms of charge, hydrophobic character and predicted helical content. None of the missense mutants affected membrane-association of L. Several of the L mutations in the central domains were highly conservative and recessive, suggesting a defect in a heterotypic protein-protein interaction, rather than in direct disruption of the bilayer structure, as had been previously proposed for L.

Rating: ChatCompletionMessage(content='This abstract provides valuable insights into the function and structure of the L lysis protein of the MS2 phage.

The findings could potentially contribute to enhancing the efficacy of MS2 phage in phage therapy against multidrug-resistant E. coli strains. \n\nRating: 8/10', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)

Title: Iron oxide-mediated semiconductor photocatalysis vs. heterogeneous photo-Fenton treatment of viruses in wastewater. Impact of the oxide particle size.
Abstract: The photo-Fenton process is recognized as a promising technique towards microorganism disinfection in wastewater, but its efficiency is hampered at near-neutral pH operating values. In this work, we overcome these obstacles by using the heterogeneous photo-Fenton process as the default disinfecting technique, targeting MS2 coliphage in wastewater. The use of low concentrations of iron oxides in wastewater without H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (wüstite, maghemite, magnetite) has demonstrated limited semiconductor-mediated MS2 inactivation. Changing the operational pH and the size of the oxide particles indicated that the isoelectric point of the iron oxides and the active surface area are crucial in the success of the process, and the possible underlying mechanisms are investigated. Furthermore, the addition of low amounts of Fe-oxides (1mgL<sup>-1</sup>) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the system (1, 5 and 10mgL<sup>-1</sup>) greatly enhanced the inactivation process, leading to heterogeneous photo-Fenton processes on the surface of the magnetically separable oxides used. Additionally, photo-dissolution of iron in the bulk, lead to homogeneous photo-Fenton, further aided by the complexation by the dissolved organic matter in the solution. Finally, we assess the impact of the presence of the bacterial host and the difference caused by the different iron sources (salts, oxides) and the Fe-oxide size (normal, nano-sized).

Title: The toxicity of cationic surfactant HDTMA-Br, desorbed from surfactant modified zeolite, towards faecal indicator and environmental microorganisms.
Abstract: Surfactant Modified Zeolite (SMZ) represents a versatile, cost-effective permeable reactive material, capable of treating multiple classes of contaminants. The potential for HDTMA-Br, a cationic surfactant commonly used to modify zeolite, to desorb from the zeolite surface has been identified as a potential issue for the ongoing use of SMZ in water remediation contexts. This paper investigates the toxicity of HDTMA-Br towards enteric virus surrogates, F-RNA bacteriophage MS2 and E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, and soil microflora. The concentration of surfactant desorbing from SMZ was quantified through a bioassay using E. coli. Results showed HDTMA-Br concentrations of ≥10<sup>-5</sup>M were toxic to MS2, ≥10<sup>-4</sup>M were toxic to E. coli and ≥10<sup>-6</sup>M were toxic to B. subtilis. No toxic relationship was established between HDTMA-Br and soil microflora. Desorption of ≥10<sup>-4</sup>M of HDTMA-Br was shown for the two SMZ samples under the mixing conditions used. Effects of this surfactant on total soil microflora were ambiguous since no toxic relationship could be established, however, HDTMA-Br, at concentrations desorbing from SMZ, were shown to impact the soil bacterium B. subtilis. Further research is required to determine the effect of this surfactant on microbial populations and species diversity in soils.

Title: Transfer of bacteriophage MS2 and fluorescein from N95 filtering facepiece respirators to hands: Measuring fomite potential.
Abstract: Contact transmission of pathogens from personal protective equipment is a concern within the healthcare industry. During public health emergency outbreaks, resources become constrained and the reuse of personal protective equipment, such as N95 filtering facepiece respirators, may be needed. This study was designed to characterize the transfer of bacteriophage MS2 and fluorescein between filtering facepiece respirators and the wearer's hands during three simulated use scenarios. Filtering facepiece respirators were contaminated with MS2 and fluorescein in droplets or droplet nuclei. Thirteen test subjects performed filtering facepiece respirator use scenarios including improper doffing, proper doffing and reuse, and improper doffing and reuse. Fluorescein and MS2 contamination transfer were quantified. The average MS2 transfer from filtering facepiece respirators to the subjects' hands ranged from 7.6-15.4% and 2.2-2.7% for droplet and droplet nuclei derived contamination, respectively. Handling filtering facepiece respirators contaminated with droplets resulted in higher levels of MS2 transfer compared to droplet nuclei for all use scenarios (p = 0.007). MS2 transfer from droplet contaminated filtering facepiece respirators during improper doffing and reuse was greater than transfer during improper doffing (p = 0.008) and proper doffing and reuse (p = 0.042). Droplet contamination resulted in higher levels of fluorescein transfer compared to droplet nuclei contaminated filtering facepiece respirators for all use scenarios (p = 0.009). Fluorescein transfer was greater for improper doffing and reuse (p = 0.007) from droplet contaminated masks compared to droplet nuclei contaminated filtering facepiece respirators and for improper doffing and reuse when compared improper doffing (p = 0.017) and proper doffing and reuse (p = 0.018) for droplet contaminated filtering facepiece respirators. For droplet nuclei contaminated filtering facepiece respirators, the difference in MS2 and fluorescein transfer did not reach statistical significance when comparing any of the use scenarios. The findings suggest that the results of fluorescein and MS2 transfer were consistent and highly correlated across the conditions of study. The data supports CDC recommendations for using proper doffing techniques and discarding filtering facepiece respirators that are directly contaminated with secretions from a cough or sneeze.

Title: Minimizing Bias in Virally Seeded Water Treatment Studies: Evaluation of Optimal Bacteriophage and Mammalian Virus Preparation Methodologies.
Abstract: One key assumption impacting data quality in viral inactivation studies is that reduction estimates are not altered by the virus seeding process. However, seeding viruses often involves the inadvertent addition of co-constituents such as cell culture components or additives used during preparation steps which can impact viral reduction estimates by inducing non-representative oxidant demand in disinfection studies and fouling in membrane assessments. The objective of this study was therefore to characterize a mammalian norovirus surrogate, murine norovirus (MNV), and bacteriophage MS2 at sequential stages of viral purification and to quantify their potential contribution to artificial oxidant demand and non-representative membrane fouling. Our results demonstrate that seeding solvent extracted and 0.1 micron filtered MNV to ~10<sup>5</sup> PFU/mL in an experimental water matrix will result in additional total organic carbon (TOC) and 30 min chlorine demand of 39.2 mg/L and 53.5 mg/L as Cl<sub>2</sub>, respectively. Performing sucrose cushion purification on the MNV stock prior to seeding reduces the impacts of TOC and chlorine demand to 1.6 and 0.15 mg/L as Cl<sub>2</sub>, respectively. The findings for MNV are likely relevant for other mammalian viruses propagated in serum-based media. Thus, advanced purification of mammalian virus stocks by sucrose cushion purification (or equivalent density-based separation approach) is warranted prior to seeding in water treatment assessments. Studies employing bacteriophage MS2 as a surrogate virus may not need virus purification, since seeding MS2 at a concentration of ~10<sup>6</sup> PFU/mL will introduce only ~1 mg/L of TOC and ~1 mg/L as Cl<sub>2</sub> of chlorine demand to experimental water matrices.

Title: Assessment of Healthcare Worker Protocol Deviations and Self-Contamination During Personal Protective Equipment Donning and Doffing.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE To evaluate healthcare worker (HCW) risk of self-contamination when donning and doffing personal protective equipment (PPE) using fluorescence and MS2 bacteriophage. DESIGN Prospective pilot study. SETTING Tertiary-care hospital. PARTICIPANTS A total of 36 HCWs were included in this study: 18 donned/doffed contact precaution (CP) PPE and 18 donned/doffed Ebola virus disease (EVD) PPE. INTERVENTIONS HCWs donned PPE according to standard protocols. Fluorescent liquid and MS2 bacteriophage were applied to HCWs. HCWs then doffed their PPE. After doffing, HCWs were scanned for fluorescence and swabbed for MS2. MS2 detection was performed using reverse transcriptase PCR. The donning and doffing processes were videotaped, and protocol deviations were recorded. RESULTS Overall, 27% of EVD PPE HCWs and 50% of CP PPE HCWs made ≥1 protocol deviation while donning, and 100% of EVD PPE HCWs and 67% of CP PPE HCWs made ≥1 protocol deviation while doffing (P=.02). The median number of doffing protocol deviations among EVD PPE HCWs was 4, versus 1 among CP PPE HCWs. Also, 15 EVD PPE protocol deviations were committed by doffing assistants and/or trained observers. Fluorescence was detected on 8 EVD PPE HCWs (44%) and 5 CP PPE HCWs (28%), most commonly on hands. MS2 was recovered from 2 EVD PPE HCWs (11%) and 3 CP PPE HCWs (17%). CONCLUSIONS Protocol deviations were common during both EVD and CP PPE doffing, and some deviations during EVD PPE doffing were committed by the HCW doffing assistant and/or the trained observer. Self-contamination was common. PPE donning/doffing are complex and deserve additional study. Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2017;38:1077-1083.

Title: Impact of Hydrogen Bonding in the Binding Site between Capsid Protein and MS2 Bacteriophage ssRNA.
Abstract: MS2 presents a well-studied example of a single-stranded RNA virus for which the genomic RNA plays a pivotal role in the virus assembly process based on the packaging signal-mediated mechanism. Packaging signals (PSs) are multiple dispersed RNA sequence/structure motifs varying around a central recognition motif that interact in a specific way with the capsid protein in the assembly process. Although the discovery and identification of these PSs was based on bioinformatics and geometric approaches, in tandem with sophisticated experimental protocols, we approach this problem using large-scale ab initio computation centered on critical aspects of the consensus protein-RNA interactions recognition motif. DFT calculations are carried out on two nucleoprotein complexes: wild-type and mutated (PDB IDs: 1ZDH and 5MSF ). The calculated partial charge distribution of residues and the strength of hydrogen bonding (HB) between them enabled us to locate the exact binding sites with the strongest HBs, identified to be LYS43-A<sup>-4</sup>, ARG49-C<sup>-13</sup>, TYR85-C<sup>-5</sup>, and LYS61-C<sup>-5</sup>, due to the change in the sequence of the mutated RNA.

Title: Bacteriophage removal efficiency as a validation and operational monitoring tool for virus reduction in wastewater reclamation: Review.
Abstract: The multiple-barrier concept is widely employed in international and domestic guidelines for wastewater reclamation and reuse for microbiological risk management, in which a wastewater reclamation system is designed to achieve guideline values of the performance target of microbe reduction. Enteric viruses are one of the pathogens for which the target reduction values are stipulated in guidelines, but frequent monitoring to validate human virus removal efficacy is challenging in a daily operation due to the cumbersome procedures for virus quantification in wastewater. Bacteriophages have been the first choice surrogate for this task, because of the well-characterized nature of strains and the presence of established protocols for quantification. Here, we performed a meta-analysis to calculate the average log<sub>10</sub> reduction values (LRVs) of somatic coliphages, F-specific phages, MS2 coliphage and T4 phage by membrane bioreactor, activated sludge, constructed wetlands, pond systems, microfiltration and ultrafiltration. The calculated LRVs of bacteriophages were then compared with reported human enteric virus LRVs. MS2 coliphage LRVs in MBR processes were shown to be lower than those of norovirus GII and enterovirus, suggesting it as a possible validation and operational monitoring tool. The other bacteriophages provided higher LRVs compared to human viruses. The data sets on LRVs of human viruses and bacteriophages are scarce except for MBR and conventional activated sludge processes, which highlights the necessity of investigating LRVs of human viruses and bacteriophages in multiple treatment unit processes.

Title: Selection of a Biosafety Level 1 (BSL-1) surrogate to evaluate surface disinfection efficacy in Ebola outbreaks: Comparison of four bacteriophages.
Abstract: The 2014 West African Ebola virus disease outbreak was the largest to date, and conflicting, chlorine-based surface disinfection protocols to interrupt disease transmission were recommended. We identified only one study documenting surface disinfection efficacy against the Ebola virus, showing a >6.6 log reduction after 5-minute exposure to 0.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) based on small-scale tests (Cook et al. (2015)). In preparation for future extensive, large-scale disinfection efficacy experiments, we replicated the Cook et al. experiment using four potential BSL-1 surrogates selected based on similarities to the Ebola virus: bacteriophages MS2, M13, Phi6, and PR772. Each bacteriophage was exposed to 0.1% and 0.5% NaOCl for 1, 5, and 10 minutes on stainless steel. MS2 and M13 were only reduced by 3.4 log and 3.5 log after a 10-minute exposure to 0.5% NaOCl, and would be overly conservative surrogates. Conversely, PR772 was too easily inactivated for surrogate use, as it was reduced by >4.8 log after only 1-minute exposure to 0.5% NaOCl. Phi6 was slightly more resistant than the Ebola virus, with 4.1 log reduction after a 5-minute exposure and not detected after a 10-minute exposure to 0.5% NaOCl. We therefore recommend Phi6 as a surrogate for evaluating the efficacy of chlorine-based surface disinfectants against the Ebola virus.

Title: Techniques for Single-Molecule mRNA Imaging in Living Cells.
Abstract: Typical measurement of macromolecules in a biological sample typically averages the result over all the cells or molecules within the sample, and while these types of measurements provide very useful information, they completely miss heterogeneity among the components within the sample that could be a very important aspect of the sample's function. These techniques are also limited in their ability to examine intracellular spatial orientation of molecular activity, which is often a critical component to the regulation of biological processes, particularly in cells with unique spatial relationships, such as neurons. This makes a strong case for single-cell and single-molecule analysis that allows similar novel insight into complex molecular machinery that would not be possible when pooling heterogeneous molecular states. mRNA has proven to be quite tractable to molecular analysis in single cells. Almost two decades of single-molecule studies of mRNA processing both in situ and in live cells have been facilitated by microscopy of mRNA. This has been made possible by multiplexing fluorophores in situ hybridization probes or fluorescent RNA-tag-binding protein probes. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the approaches that have made single-molecule mRNA imaging accessible, as well as to give an overview of the state of the art for techniques that are available to track mRNA in real time in living cells, highlighting the application to neuroscience.

Title: Structure and Dynamics of the Tetra-A Loop and (A-A)-U Sequence Motif within the Coliphage GA Replicase RNA Operator.
Abstract: The three-dimensional structure of a RNA hairpin containing the RNA operator binding site for bacteriophage GA coat protein is presented. The phage GA operator contains the asymmetric (A-A)-U sequence motif and is capped by a four-adenine (tetra-A) loop. The uridine of the (A-A)-U motif preferentially pairs with the 5'-proximal cross-strand adenine, and the 3'-proximal adenine stacks into the helix. The tetra-A loop is well-ordered with adenine residues 2-4 forming a 3' stack. This loop conformation stands in contrast to the structure of the 5'-AUUA loop of the related phage MS2 operator in which residues 1 and 2 form a 5' stack. The context dependence of the (A-A)-U sequence motif conformation was examined using structures of 76 unique occurrences from the Protein Data Bank. The motif almost always has one adenine bulged and the other adenine adopting an A-U base pair. In the case in which the (A-A)-U motif is flanked by only one Watson-Crick base pair, the adenine adjacent to the flanking base pair tends to bulge; 80% of motifs with a 3' flanking pair have a 3' bulged adenine, and 84% of motifs with a 5' flanking pair have a 5' bulged adenine. The frequencies of 3'- and 5'-proximal adenines bulging are 33 and 67%, respectively, when the (A-A)-U motif is flanked by base pairs on both sides. Although a 3' flanking cytidine correlates (88%) with bulging of the 5'-proximal adenine, no strict dependence on flanking nucleotide identity was identified for the 5' side.

Title: Total staphylococci as performance surrogate for greywater treatment.
Abstract: Faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) are commonly used as water quality indicators; implying faecal contamination and therefore the potential presence of pathogenic enteric bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. Hence in wastewater treatment, the most commonly used treatment process measures (surrogates) are total coliforms, faecal coliforms, Escherichia coli (E. coli), and enterococci. However, greywater potentially contains skin pathogens unrelated to faecal load, and E. coli and other FIB may grow within greywater unrelated to pathogens. Overall, FIB occurs at fluctuating and relatively low concentrations compared to other endogenous greywater bacteria affecting their ability as surrogates for pathogen reduction. Therefore, unlike municipal sewage, FIB provides a very limited and unreliable log-reduction surrogate measure for on-site greywater treatment systems. Based on our recent metagenomic study of laundry greywater, skin-associated bacteria such as Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, and Propionibacterium spp. dominate and may result in more consistent treatment surrogates than traditional FIB. Here, we investigated various Staphylococcus spp. as potential surrogates to reliably assay over 4-log<sub>10</sub> reduction by the final-stage UV disinfection step commonly used for on-site greywater reuse, and compare them to various FIB/phage surrogates. A collimated UV beam was used to determine the efficacy of UV inactivation (255, 265 and 285 nm) against E. coli, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, E. casseliflavus, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. epidermidis. Staphylococcus spp. was estimated by combining the bi-linear dose-response curves for S. aureus and S. epidermidis and was shown to be less resistant to UV irradiation than the other surrogates examined. Hence, a relative inactivation credit is suggested; whereas, the doses required to achieve a 4 and 5-log<sub>10</sub> reduction of Staphylococcus spp. (13.0 and 20.9 mJ cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively) were used to determine the relative inactivation of the other microorganisms investigated. The doses required to achieve a 4 and 5-log<sub>10</sub> reduction of Staphylococcus spp. resulted in a log<sub>10</sub> reduction of 1.4 and 4.1 for E. coli, 0.8 and 2.8 for E. faecalis, 0.8 and 3.6 for E. casseliflavus and 0.8 and 1.2 for MS2 coliphage, respectively. Given the concentration difference of Staphylococcus spp. and FIB (3 to 5-log<sub>10</sub> higher), we propose the use of Staphylococcus spp. as a novel endogenous performance surrogate to demonstrate greywater treatment performance given its relatively high and consistent concentration and therefore ability to demonstrate over 5-log<sub>10</sub> reductions.

Title: A method for the improved detection of aerosolized influenza viruses and the male-specific (F+) RNA coliphage MS2.
Abstract: The detection of aerosolized viruses can serve as an important surveillance and control tool in agriculture, human health, and environmental settings. Here, we adapted an anion exchange resin-based method, initially developed to concentrate negatively charged viruses from water, to liquid impingement-based bioaerosol sampling. In this method, aerosolized viruses are collected in a 20ml liquid sample contained within widely used impingers, BioSamplers (SKC Inc., Eighty Four, PA), and further concentrated via adsorption to an anion exchange resin that is suspended within this liquid. Viral nucleic acids are then extracted from the resin to facilitate molecular analyses through a reduction in the effective sample volume. For this study, various quantities of two negatively charged viruses, type A and type B influenza viruses (FluMist Quadrivalent vaccine) and the male-specific (F+) RNA coliphage MS2 (MS2), were nebulized into a custom-built bioaerosolization chamber, and sampled using BioSamplers with and without anion exchange resin. Compared to direct testing of the BioSampler liquid, detection was improved by 6.77× and 3.33× for type A and type B influenza viruses, respectively, by using the anion exchange resin. For MS2, the anion exchange resin method allowed for an average improvement in detection of 8.26×.

Title: Identification of the inactivating factors and mechanisms exerted on MS2 coliphage in concentrated synthetic urine.
Abstract: Volume reduction (condensation) is a key for the practical usage of human urine as a fertilizer because it enables the saving of storage space and the reduction of transportation cost. However, concentrated urine may carry infectious disease risks resulting from human pathogens frequently present in excreta, though the survival of pathogens in concentrated urine is not well understood. In this study, the inactivation of MS2 coliphage, a surrogate for single-stranded RNA human enteric viruses, in concentrated synthetic urine was investigated. The infectious titer reduction of MS2 coliphage in synthetic urine samples was measured by plaque assay, and the reduction of genome copy number was monitored by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RTqPCR). Among chemical-physical conditions such as pH and osmotic pressure, uncharged ammonia was shown to be the predominant factor responsible for MS2 inactivation, independently of urine concentration level. The reduction rate of the viral genome number varied among genome regions, but the comprehensive reduction rate of six genome regions was well correlated with that of the infectious titer of MS2 coliphage. This indicates that genome degradation is the main mechanism driving loss of infectivity, and that RT-qPCR targeting the six genome regions can be used as a culture-independent assay for monitoring infectivity loss of the coliphage in urine. MS2 inactivation rate constants were well predicted by a model using ion composition and speciation in synthetic urine samples, which suggests that MS2 infectivity loss can be estimated solely based on the solution composition, temperature and pH, without explicitly accounting for effects of osmotic pressure.

Title: Internal control for real-time polymerase chain reaction based on MS2 bacteriophage for RNA viruses diagnostics.
Abstract: Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is routinely used to detect viral infections. In Brazil, it is mandatory the use of nucleic acid tests to detect hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus and human immunodeficiency virus in blood banks because of the immunological window. The use of an internal control (IC) is necessary to differentiate the true negative results from those consequent from a failure in some step of the nucleic acid test.

Title: Solar photocatalytic disinfection of E. coli and bacteriophages MS2, ΦX174 and PR772 using TiO<sub>2</sub>, ZnO and ruthenium based complexes in a continuous flow system.
Abstract: The performance of photocatalytic treatment processes were assessed using different photocatalysts against E. coli and bacteriophages MS2, ΦX174 and PR772, in a recirculating continuous flow compound parabolic collector system under real sunlight conditions. Suspended TiO<sub>2</sub> and ZnO nanoparticle powders and Tris(2,2'-bipyridyl)dichlororuthenium(II) hexahydrate in solution were tested separately, as well as in combination, using E. coli. For a 3-log reduction of E. coli in distilled water, inactivation rates in terms of cumulative dose were in the order Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>>(TiO<sub>2</sub> & Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>)>(ZnO & Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>)>ZnO>TiO<sub>2</sub>>photolysis. Reactivation of E. coli was observed following all trials despite the detection limit being reached, although the reactivated colonies were observed to be under stress and much slower growing when compared to original colonies. Treatment with Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> was also compared against standard photolysis of bacteriophages MS2, ΦX174 and PR772 with the order of photolytic inactivation for a 3-log reduction in terms of cumulative UV-A dose being ΦX174>PR772>MS2. However, MS2 was found to be the most susceptible bacteriophage to treatment with Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, with complete removal of the phage observed within the first 15min of exposure. Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> also significantly improved inactivation rates for PR772 and ΦX174.

Title: MS2 Lysis of Escherichia coli Depends on Host Chaperone DnaJ.
Abstract: The L protein of the single-stranded RNA phage MS2 causes lysis of <i>Escherichia coli</i> without inducing bacteriolytic activity or inhibiting net peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis. To find host genes required for L-mediated lysis, spontaneous Ill (<u>i</u>nsensitivity to <u>L</u><u>l</u>ysis) mutants were selected as survivors of L expression and shown to have a missense change of the highly conserved proline (P330Q) in the C-terminal domain of DnaJ. In the <i>dnaJ</i><sub>P330Q</sub> mutant host, L-mediated lysis is completely blocked at 30°C without affecting the intracellular levels of L. At higher temperatures (37°C and 42°C), both lysis and L accumulation are delayed. The lysis block at 30°C in the <i>dnaJ</i><sub>P330Q</sub> mutant was recessive and could be suppressed by <u><i>L</i></u><u>o</u>vercomes <u><i>d</i></u><i>na</i><u><i>J</i></u> (<i>L<sup>odj</sup></i> ) alleles selected for restoration of lysis. All three <i>L<sup>odj</sup></i> alleles lack the highly basic N-terminal half of the lysis protein and cause lysis ∼20 min earlier than full-length L. DnaJ was found to form a complex with full-length L. This complex was abrogated by the P330Q mutation and was absent with the L<sup>odj</sup> truncations. These results suggest that, in the absence of interaction with DnaJ, the N-terminal domain of L interferes with its ability to bind to its unknown target. The lysis retardation and DnaJ chaperone dependency conferred by the nonessential, highly basic N-terminal domain of L resembles the SlyD chaperone dependency conferred by the highly basic C-terminal domain of the E lysis protein of ϕX174, suggesting a common theme where single-gene lysis can be modulated by host factors influenced by physiological conditions.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Small single-stranded nucleic acid lytic phages (<i>Microviridae</i> and <i>Leviviridae</i>) lyse their host by expressing a single "protein antibiotic." The protein antibiotics from two out of three prototypic small lytic viruses have been shown to inhibit two different steps in the conserved PG biosynthesis pathway. However, the molecular basis of lysis caused by L, the lysis protein of the third prototypic virus, MS2, is unknown. The significance of our research lies in the identification of DnaJ as a chaperone in the MS2 L lysis pathway and the identification of the minimal lytic domain of MS2 L. Additionally, our research highlights the importance of the highly conserved P330 residue in the C-terminal domain of DnaJ for specific protein interactions.

Title: Inactivation modeling of human enteric virus surrogates, MS2, Qβ, and ΦX174, in water using UVC-LEDs, a novel disinfecting system.
Abstract: In order to assure the microbial safety of drinking water, UVC-LED treatment has emerged as a possible technology to replace the use of conventional low pressure (LP) mercury vapor UV lamps. In this investigation, inactivation of Human Enteric Virus (HuEV) surrogates with UVC-LEDs was investigated in a water disinfection system, and kinetic model equations were applied to depict the surviving infectivities of the viruses. MS2, Qβ, and ΦX 174 bacteriophages were inoculated into sterile distilled water (DW) and irradiated with UVC-LED printed circuit boards (PCBs) (266nm and 279nm) or conventional LP lamps. Infectivities of bacteriophages were effectively reduced by up to 7-log after 9mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> treatment for MS2 and Qβ, and 1mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> for ΦX 174. UVC-LEDs showed a superior viral inactivation effect compared to conventional LP lamps at the same dose (1mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>). Non-log linear plot patterns were observed, so that Weibull, Biphasic, Log linear-tail, and Weibull-tail model equations were used to fit the virus survival curves. For MS2 and Qβ, Weibull and Biphasic models fit well with R<sup>2</sup> values approximately equal to 0.97-0.99, and the Weibull-tail equation accurately described survival of ΦX 174. The level of UV-susceptibility among coliphages measured by the inactivation rate constant, k, was statistically different (ΦX 174 (ssDNA)>MS2, Qβ (ssRNA)), and indicated that sensitivity to UV was attributed to viral genetic material.

Title: Inactivation of MS2 bacteriophage by titanium dioxide nanoparticles in the presence of quartz sand with and without ambient light.
Abstract: Virus inactivation by nanoparticles (NPs) is hypothesized to affect virus fate and transport in the subsurface. This study examines the interactions of viruses with titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) anatase NPs, which is a good disinfectant with unique physiochemical properties. The bacteriophage MS2 was used as a model virus. A series of batch experiments of MS2 inactivation by TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs were conducted at room temperature (25°C), in the presence and absence of quartz sand, with and without ambient light. Three sets of experiments were performed in phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS) and one in distilled deionized water (ddH<sub>2</sub>O). The virus inactivation experimental data were satisfactorily fitted with a pseudo-first order expression with a time dependent rate coefficient. Quartz sand was shown to affect MS2 inactivation by TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs both in the presence and absence of ambient light, because, under the experimental conditions of this study, the quartz sand offers a protection to the attached MS2 against inactivation. Moreover, it was shown that low TiO<sub>2</sub> concentration (10mg/L) affected only slightly MS2 inactivation with and without ambient light. Furthermore, PBS hindered MS2 inactivation by TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs.

Title: Assessment of the efficacy of membrane filtration processes to remove human enteric viruses and the suitability of bacteriophages and a plant virus as surrogates for those viruses.
Abstract: Here, we evaluated the efficacy of direct microfiltration (MF) and ultrafiltration (UF) to remove three representative human enteric viruses (i.e., adenovirus [AdV] type 40, coxsackievirus [CV] B5, and hepatitis A virus [HAV] IB), and one surrogate of human caliciviruses (i.e., murine norovirus [MNV] type 1). Eight different MF membranes and three different UF membranes were used. We also examined the ability of coagulation pretreatment with high-basicity polyaluminum chloride (PACl) to enhance virus removal by MF. The removal ratios of two bacteriophages (MS2 and φX174) and a plant virus (pepper mild mottle virus; PMMoV) were compared with the removal ratios of the human enteric viruses to assess the suitability of these viruses to be used as surrogates for human enteric viruses. The virus removal ratios obtained with direct MF with membranes with nominal pore sizes of 0.1-0.22 μm differed, depending on the membrane used; adsorptive interactions, particularly hydrophobic interactions between virus particles and the membrane surface, were dominant factors for virus removal. In contrast, direct UF with membranes with nominal molecular weight cutoffs of 1-100 kDa effectively removed viruses through size exclusion, and >4-log<sub>10</sub> removal was achieved when a membrane with a nominal molecular weight cutoff of 1 kDa was used. At pH 7 and 8, in-line coagulation-MF with nonsulfated high-basicity PACls containing Al<sub>30</sub> species had generally a better virus removal (i.e., >4-log<sub>10</sub> virus removal) than the other aluminum-based coagulants, except for φX174. For all of the filtration processes, the removal ratios of AdV, CV, HAV, and MNV were comparable and strongly correlated with each other. The removal ratios of MS2 and PMMoV were comparable or smaller than those of the three human enteric viruses and MNV, and were strongly correlated with those of the three human enteric viruses and MNV. The removal ratios obtained with coagulation-MF for φX174 were markedly smaller than those obtained for the three human enteric viruses and MNV. However, because MS2 was inactivated after contact with PACl during coagulation pretreatment, unlike AdV, CV, MNV, and PMMoV, the removal ratios of infectious MS2 were probably an overestimation of the ability of coagulation-MF to remove infectious AdV, CV, and caliciviruses. Thus, PMMoV appears to be a suitable surrogate for human enteric viruses, whereas MS2 and φX174 do not, for the assessment of the efficacy of membrane filtration processes to remove viruses.

Title: Postharvest Reduction of Coliphage MS2 from Romaine Lettuce during Simulated Commercial Processing with and without a Chlorine-Based Sanitizer.
Abstract: Viral foodborne outbreaks are a serious threat to public health, and fresh produce is becoming increasingly recognized as a transmission vehicle. To limit foodborne disease, ready-to-eat leafy greens are typically washed with a chlorine-based sanitizer during commercial production. This study assessed the efficacy of a chlorine-based sanitizer against coliphage MS2, as a potential surrogate for foodborne viruses, on fresh-cut romaine lettuce during simulated commercial production using a small-scale processing line. Before processing, romaine lettuce was inoculated to contain approximately 10<sup>5</sup> and 10<sup>6</sup> PFU/g of MS2 for experiments with and without sanitizer, respectively. Lettuce samples were collected following each stage of processing, which included mechanical shredding, 2 min of flume washing (with or without 25 ppm of free chlorine), shaker table dewatering, and centrifugal drying. In addition, the spent centrifuge water and flume wash water were collected, with the flume water concentrated using hollow-fiber ultrafiltration. MS2 was recovered from lettuce in Tris-glycine buffer and quantified as PFUs in a double-agar overlay assay. The greatest reduction in MS2 occurred between shredding and flume washing, with levels remaining relatively stable following flume washing with or without 25 ppm of free chlorine. Average total reductions of 0.8 and 1.0 log PFU/g were seen after processing with and without the sanitizer, respectively, with no statistical difference observed between the two treatments (P > 0.05). The average MS2 level in the spent centrifugation water started at 4.0 log PFU/ml for experiments with sanitizer and the average MS2 reduction in the flume wash water was 4 log (PFU) for experiments with sanitizer, demonstrating that removals could be achieved in the water itself. These findings suggest that the currently recommended commercial production practices are unable to effectively decrease viruses once they have attached to leafy greens during commercial processing.

Title: Tethering RNA to chromatin for fluorescence microscopy based analysis of nuclear organization.
Abstract: Nuclear RNAs emerge as important factors to orchestrate the dynamic organization of the nucleus into functional subcompartments. By tethering RNAs to distinct genomic loci, RNA-dependent chromatin changes can be dissected by fluorescence microscopic analysis. Here we describe how this approach is implemented in mammalian cells. It involves two high-affinity protein-nucleic acid interactions that can be established with a number of different protein domains and DNA and RNA sequences. A prototypic system is described here in detail: It consists of the binding of MS2 bacteriophage coat protein to its RNA recognition sequence and the interaction between the bacterial LacI repressor protein to its target lacO operator DNA sequence. Via these interactions RNAs tagged with the MS2 recognition sequences can be recruited to a locus with integrated lacO repeats. By inducing RNA-chromatin binding a number of RNA-dependent activities can be dissected: (i) The RNA-induced compaction or decondensation of chromatin, (ii) identification of RNA-interacting chromatin modifiers that set epigenetic signals such as posttranslational histone modifications, and (iii) nuclear relocation of a genomic locus targeted by the tethered RNA. Thus, a variety of RNA-dependent activities can be evaluated with the MS2-LacI system, which are crucial for understanding how RNA shapes nuclear organization.

Title: Comparative Inactivation of Murine Norovirus and MS2 Bacteriophage by Peracetic Acid and Monochloramine in Municipal Secondary Wastewater Effluent.
Abstract: Chlorination has long been used for disinfection of municipal wastewater (MWW) effluent while the use peracetic acid (PAA) has been proposed more recently in the United States. Previous work has demonstrated the bactericidal effectiveness of PAA and monochloramine in wastewater, but limited information is available for viruses, especially ones of mammalian origin (e.g., norovirus). Therefore, a comparative assessment was performed of the virucidal efficacy of PAA and monochloramine against murine norovirus (MNV) and MS2 bacteriophage in secondary effluent MWW and phosphate buffer (PB). A suite of inactivation kinetic models was fit to the viral inactivation data. Predicted concentration-time (CT) values for 1-log<sub>10</sub> MS2 reduction by PAA and monochloramine in MWW were 1254 and 1228 mg-min/L, respectively. The 1-, 2-, and 3-log<sub>10</sub> model predicted CT values for MNV viral reduction in MWW were 32, 47, and 69 mg-min/L for PAA and 6, 13, and 28 mg-min/L for monochloramine, respectively. Wastewater treatment plant disinfection practices informed by MS2 inactivation data will likely be protective for public health but may overestimate CT values for reduction of MNV. Additionally, equivalent CT values in PB resulted in greater viral reduction which indicate that viral inactivation data in laboratory grade water may not be generalizable to MWW applications.

Title: The impact of viral RNA on the association free energies of capsid protein assembly: bacteriophage MS2 as a case study.
Abstract: A large number of single-stranded RNA viruses assemble their capsid and their genomic material simultaneously. The RNA viral genome plays multiple roles in this process that are currently only partly understood. In this work, we investigated the thermodynamic basis of the role of viral RNA on the assembly of capsid proteins. The viral capsid of bacteriophage MS2 was considered as a case study. The MS2 virus capsid is composed of 60 AB and 30 CC protein dimers. We investigated the effect of RNA stem loop (the translational repressor TR) binding to the capsid dimers on the dimer-dimer relative association free energies. We found that TR binding results in destabilization of AB self-association compared with AB and CC association. This indicates that the association of the AB and CC dimers is the most likely assembly pathway for the MS2 virus, which explains the experimental observation of alternating patterns of AB and CC dimers in dominant assembly intermediates of the MS2 virus. The presence of viral RNA, therefore, dramatically channels virus assembly to a limited number of pathways, thereby enhancing the efficiency of virus self-assembly process. Interestingly, Thr59Ser and Thr45Ala mutations of the dimers, in the absence of RNA stem loops, lead to stabilization of AB self-association compared with the AB and CC associations, thereby channelling virus assembly towards a fivefold (AB)<sub>5</sub> pentamer intermediate, providing a testable hypothesis of our thermodynamic arguments.

Title: Pathogen-specific deep sequence-coupled biopanning: A method for surveying human antibody responses.
Abstract: Identifying the targets of antibody responses during infection is important for designing vaccines, developing diagnostic and prognostic tools, and understanding pathogenesis. We developed a novel deep sequence-coupled biopanning approach capable of identifying the protein epitopes of antibodies present in human polyclonal serum. Here, we report the adaptation of this approach for the identification of pathogen-specific epitopes recognized by antibodies elicited during acute infection. As a proof-of-principle, we applied this approach to assessing antibodies to Dengue virus (DENV). Using a panel of sera from patients with acute secondary DENV infection, we panned a DENV antigen fragment library displayed on the surface of bacteriophage MS2 virus-like particles and characterized the population of affinity-selected peptide epitopes by deep sequence analysis. Although there was considerable variation in the responses of individuals, we found several epitopes within the Envelope glycoprotein and Non-Structural Protein 1 that were commonly enriched. This report establishes a novel approach for characterizing pathogen-specific antibody responses in human sera, and has future utility in identifying novel diagnostic and vaccine targets.

To control the whole process of analysis and in order to guarantee the validity and reliability of results, process control viruses (PCV) are used. The present article describes the process of preparation and use of such PCV- MS2 phage-like particles (MS2 PLP) - in RT-qPCR detection and quantification of enteric RNA viruses. The MS2 PLP were derived from bacteriophage MS2 carrying a unique and specific <i>de novo</i>-constructed RNA target sequence originating from the DNA of two extinct species. The amount of prepared MS2 particles was quantified using four independent methods - UV spectrophotometry, fluorimetry, transmission electron microscopy and a specifically developed duplex RT-qPCR. To evaluate the usefulness of MS2 PLP in routine diagnostics different matrices known to harbor enteric RNA viruses (swab samples, liver tissue, serum, feces, and vegetables) were artificially contaminated with specific amounts of MS2 PLP. The extraction efficiencies were calculated for each individual matrix. The prepared particles fulfill all requirements for PCV - they are very stable, non-infectious, and are genetically distinct from the target RNA viruses. Due to these properties they represent a good morphological and physiochemical model. The use of MS2 PLP as a PCV in detection and quantification of enteric RNA viruses was evaluated in different types of matrices.

Title: Stem-loop RNA labeling can affect nuclear and cytoplasmic mRNA processing.
Abstract: The binding of sequence-specific RNA-interacting proteins, such as the bacteriophage MS2 or PP7 coat proteins, to their corresponding target sequences has been extremely useful and widely used to visualize single mRNAs in vivo. However, introduction of MS2 stem-loops into yeast mRNAs has recently been shown to lead to the accumulation of RNA fragments, suggesting that the loops impair mRNA decay. This result was questioned, because fragment occurrence was mainly assessed using ensemble methods, and their cellular localization and its implications had not been addressed on a single transcript level. Here, we demonstrate that the introduction of either MS2 stem-loops (MS2SL) or PP7 stem-loops (PP7SL) can affect the processing and subcellular localization of mRNA. We use single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) to determine the localization of three independent mRNAs tagged with the stem-loop labeling systems in glucose-rich and glucose starvation conditions. Transcripts containing MS2SL or PP7SL display aberrant localization in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. These defects are most prominent in glucose starvation conditions, with nuclear mRNA processing being altered and stem-loop fragments abnormally enriching in processing bodies (PBs). The mislocalization of SL-containing RNAs is independent of the presence of the MS2 or PP7 coat protein (MCP or PCP).

Title: Application of low frequency pulsed ohmic heating for inactivation of foodborne pathogens and MS-2 phage in buffered peptone water and tomato juice.
Abstract: The purpose of this study was to inactivate foodborne pathogens effectively by ohmic heating in buffered peptone water and tomato juice without causing electrode corrosion and quality degradation. Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Listeria monocytogenes were used as representative foodborne pathogens and MS-2 phage was used as a norovirus surrogate. Buffered peptone water and tomato juice inoculated with pathogens were treated with pulsed ohmic heating at different frequencies (0.06-1 kHz). Propidium iodide uptake values of bacterial pathogens were significantly (p < 0.05) larger at 0.06-0.5 kHz than at 1 kHz, and sub-lethal injury of pathogenic bacteria was reduced by decreasing frequency. MS-2 phage was inactivated more effectively at low frequency, and was more sensitive to acidic conditions than pathogenic bacteria. Electrode corrosion and quality degradation of tomato juice were not observed regardless of frequency. This study suggests that low frequency pulsed ohmic heating is applicable to inactivate foodborne pathogens effectively without causing electrode corrosion and quality degradation in tomato juice.

Title: Virus inactivation in stored human urine, sludge and animal manure under typical conditions of storage or mesophilic anaerobic digestion.
Abstract: Viruses represent major disease transmitting agents carried by human excreta and animal manure. Understanding virus inactivation is therefore essential in preventing microbial spread due to inadequate treatment of these materials. Here, we investigated the inactivation kinetics of the single-stranded (ss) RNA phage MS2, DNA phages T4 and ΦX174, andthe double-stranded DNA human adenovirus in stored human urine, sludge, and animal manure, at temperatures and pH valuestypical of storage under naturally occurring conditions or mesophilic anaerobic digestion (<40 °C). The ssRNA phage MS2 was most readily inactivated in all samples compared to the other viruses tested. This is consistent with previous findings in wellcontrolled buffer solutions of similar composition, where inactivation was found to be governedby bases (NH<sub>3</sub>, carbonate, hydroxide) that catalyze the transesterification and cleavage of the ssRNA. Correspondingly, MS2 inactivation kinetics in real matrices could be adequately modelled by only taking into account the effects of temperature, pH, carbonate and ammonia on the integrity of ssRNA. DNA viruses were more persistent compared to MS2;however, inactivation in selected sludge and manure samples proceeded at faster rates compared to well-controlled buffersolutions of similar composition. This indicates a contribution of microbial or enzymatic activity to inactivation of DNA viruses. Overall, this study identifies the most important factors contributing to inactivation of viruses in human excreta and manure, and highlights the differences in inactivation kinetics and mechanisms between ssRNA and DNA viruses.

Title: Resistance of Aerosolized Bacterial Viruses to Four Germicidal Products.
Abstract: Viral diseases can spread through a variety of routes including aerosols. Yet, limited data are available on the efficacy of aerosolized chemicals to reduce viral loads in the air. Bacteriophages (phages) are often used as surrogates for hazardous viruses in aerosol studies because they are inexpensive, easy to handle, and safe for laboratory workers. Moreover, several of these bacterial viruses display physical characteristics similar to pathogenic human and animal viruses, like morphological size, type of nucleic acids, capsid morphology, and the presence of an envelope. In this study, the efficacy of four chemicals was evaluated on four airborne phages at two different relative humidity levels. Non-tailed bacteriophages MS2 (single-stranded RNA), ϕ6 (double-stranded RNA, enveloped), PR772 (double-stranded DNA), and ϕX174 (single-stranded DNA) were first aerosolized in a 55L rotative environmental chamber at 19°C with 25% and 50% relative humidity. Then, hydrogen peroxide, Eugenol (phenylpropene used in commercial perfumes and flavorings), Mist® (automobile disinfectant containing Triethylene glycol), and Pledge® (multisurface disinfectant containing Isopropanol, n-Alkyl Dimethyl Benzyl Amonium Chlorides, and n-Alkyl Dimethyl Ethylbenzyl Ammonium Chloride) were nebulized with the phages using a separate nebulizer. Aerosols were maintained in suspension during 10 minutes, 1 hour, and 2 hours. Viral aerosols were sampled using an SKC BioSampler and samples were analyzed using qPCR and plaque assays. The resistance levels of the four phages varied depending on the relative humidity (RH) and germicidal products tested. Phage MS2 was the most stable airborne virus under the environmental conditions tested while phage PR772 was the least stable. Pledge® and Eugenol reduced the infectivity of all airborne phages tested. At 25% RH, Pledge® and Eugenol were more effective at reducing infectivity of RNA phages ϕ6 and MS2. At 50% RH, Pledge® was the most effective agent against phage MS2. These findings illustrate that various airborne viruses should be tested to demonstrate the effectiveness of germicidal treatments. This research also provides a set of parameters for testing germicidal products in large-scale settings to reduce the risk of virus transmission.

Rating: ChatCompletionMessage(content='This abstract provides valuable information on the efficacy of various germicidal products, including their impact on airborne phages such as the non-tailed bacteriophage MS2.

By investigating the resistance levels of airborne phages to different treatments, this study contributes to our knowledge of how to manipulate phages for therapeutic purposes. The findings on the stability of phage MS2 and its susceptibility to germicidal agents are directly relevant to the goal of using MS2 phage in phage therapy against multidrug-resistant E. coli. \n\nRating: 8/10', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)

Title: The role of the loop 1 region in MazFbs mRNA interferase from Bacillus subtilis in recognition of the 3' end of the RNA substrate.
Abstract: MazFbs is an mRNA interferase from Bacillus subtilis specifically recognizing UACAU. The X-ray structure of its complex with an RNA substrate has been also solved. When its amino acid sequence is compared with that of MazFhw, an mRNA interferase from a highly halophilic archaeon, recognizing UUACUCA, the 9-residue loop-1 region is highly homologous except that the V<sub>16</sub>V<sub>17</sub> sequence in MazFbs is replaced with TK in MazFhw. Thus, we examined the role of the VV sequence in RNA substrate recognition by replacing it with TK, GG, AA or LL. The substitution mutants thus constructed showed significant differences in cleavage specificity using MS2 phage RNA. The primer extension analysis of the cleavage sites revealed that the VV sequence plays an important role in the recognition of the 3'-end base of the RNA substrate.

Rating: ChatCompletionMessage(content='This abstract explores the role of specific amino acid sequences in the MazFbs mRNA interferase in interaction with RNA substrates.

Title: Elimination of representative contaminant candidate list viruses, coxsackievirus, echovirus, hepatitis A virus, and norovirus, from water by coagulation processes.
Abstract: We examined the removal of representative contaminant candidate list (CCL) viruses (coxsackievirus [CV] B5, echovirus type [EV] 11, and hepatitis A virus [HAV] IB), recombinant norovirus virus-like particles (rNV-VLPs), and murine norovirus (MNV) type 1 by coagulation. Water samples were subjected to coagulation with polyaluminum chloride (PACl, basicity 1.5) followed by either settling or settling and filtration. Together with our previously published results, the removal ratio order, as evaluated by a plaque-forming-unit method or an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay after settling, was HAV>EV=rNV-VLPs≥CV=poliovirus type 1=MNV>adenovirus type 40 (range, 0.1-2.7-log<sub>10</sub>). Infectious HAV was likely inactivated by the PACl and therefore was removed to a greater extent than the other viruses. A nonsulfated high-basicity PACl (basicity 2.1), removed the CCL viruses more efficiently than did two other sulfated PACls (basicity 1.5 or 2.1), alum, or ferric chloride. We also examined the removal ratio of two bacteriophages. The removal ratios for MS2 tended to be larger than those of the CCL viruses, whereas those for φX174 were comparable with or smaller than those of the CCL viruses. Therefore, φX174 may be a useful conservative surrogate for CCL viruses during coagulation.

Title: Analysis of Hydroxyl Radicals and Inactivation Mechanisms of Bacteriophage MS2 in Response to a Simultaneous Application of UV and Chlorine.
Abstract: The simultaneous application of UV and chlorine (expressed as UV/Cl<sub>2</sub>) as a water treatment method may be a good disinfection option for UV-resistant microorganisms, such as human adenoviruses (HAdVs). In this study, we developed two approaches using UV/Cl<sub>2</sub>: one to quantitate the OH• radicals based on the degradation of the probe compound para-chlorobenzoic acid (pCBA) and the other to use bacteriophage MS2 to understand the virus inactivation mechanisms in response to UV, chlorine and UV/Cl<sub>2</sub> disinfection using reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), attachment and genome penetration assays. The results revealed that OH• radicals were produced at a concentration of 2.70 × 10<sup>-14</sup> M in the UV/Cl<sub>2</sub> treatment with a practical chlorine dose of 1 mg/L and with a minimum UV<sub>254</sub> fluence of approximately 10 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>, whereas UV or chlorine alone did not produce OH• radicals. In the UV/Cl<sub>2</sub> treatment, synergistic effects on viral genome damage were observed, but were not directly due to OH• radicals. The ability of MS2 to penetrate the genome of the host bacteria was impaired, but its ability to attach to the host was not affected by the treatment. We concluded that the major cause of virus inactivation in response to UV/Cl<sub>2</sub> was the damage to the viral genome caused by combination actions of chlorine species and OH• radicals.

Title: In situ structures of the genome and genome-delivery apparatus in a single-stranded RNA virus.
Abstract: Packaging of the genome into a protein capsid and its subsequent delivery into a host cell are two fundamental processes in the life cycle of a virus. Unlike double-stranded DNA viruses, which pump their genome into a preformed capsid, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses, such as bacteriophage MS2, co-assemble their capsid with the genome; however, the structural basis of this co-assembly is poorly understood. MS2 infects Escherichia coli via the host 'sex pilus' (F-pilus); it was the first fully sequenced organism and is a model system for studies of translational gene regulation, RNA-protein interactions, and RNA virus assembly. Its positive-sense ssRNA genome of 3,569 bases is enclosed in a capsid with one maturation protein monomer and 89 coat protein dimers arranged in a T = 3 icosahedral lattice. The maturation protein is responsible for attaching the virus to an F-pilus and delivering the viral genome into the host during infection, but how the genome is organized and delivered is not known. Here we describe the MS2 structure at 3.6 Å resolution, determined by electron-counting cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) and asymmetric reconstruction. We traced approximately 80% of the backbone of the viral genome, built atomic models for 16 RNA stem-loops, and identified three conserved motifs of RNA-coat protein interactions among 15 of these stem-loops with diverse sequences. The stem-loop at the 3' end of the genome interacts extensively with the maturation protein, which, with just a six-helix bundle and a six-stranded β-sheet, forms a genome-delivery apparatus and joins 89 coat protein dimers to form a capsid. This atomic description of genome-capsid interactions in a spherical ssRNA virus provides insight into genome delivery via the host sex pilus and mechanisms underlying ssRNA-capsid co-assembly, and inspires speculation about the links between nucleoprotein complexes and the origins of viruses.

Title: Variables influencing the efficiency and interpretation of reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR): An empirical study using Bacteriophage MS2.
Abstract: Reverse transcription, quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is a sensitive method for quantification of specific RNA targets, but the first step of the assay, reverse transcription, is notoriously variable and sensitive to reaction conditions. In this study, we used purified Bacteriophage MS2 genomic RNA as a model virus target to test two different RT enzymes (SuperScript II and SuperScript III), two RT-priming strategies (gene-specific primers and random hexamers), and varying background RNA concentrations (0-50ngμl<sup>-1</sup>) to determine how these variables influence the efficiency of reverse transcription over a range of target concentrations (10<sup>1</sup>-10<sup>7</sup> copies μl<sup>-1</sup>). The efficiency of the RT reaction was greatly improved by increasing both background RNA and primer concentrations, but the benefit provided by background RNA was source dependent. At a given target concentration, similar RT efficiencies were achieved with gene-specific primers and random hexamers, but the latter required much higher concentrations. With random hexamers, we observed a systematic variation in RT reaction efficiency as a function of target concentration. Using an RNA standard curve that was also subject to RT effectively normalized for this systematic variability, but the assay accuracy depended critically on the length of the standard RNA extending to the 3' end of the qPCR target site. Our results shed some light on previous contradictory conclusions in the literature, and provide insights that may aid in the design of RT-qPCR assays and the design of synthetic RNA standards when full-length material is not available.

Title: Evaluating UV-C LED disinfection performance and investigating potential dual-wavelength synergy.
Abstract: A dual-wavelength UV-C LED unit, emitting at peaks of 260 nm, 280 nm, and the combination of 260|280 nm together was evaluated for its inactivation efficacy and energy efficiency at disinfecting Escherichia coli, MS2 coliphage, human adenovirus type 2 (HAdV2), and Bacillus pumilus spores, compared to conventional low-pressure and medium-pressure UV mercury vapor lamps. The dual-wavelength unit was also used to measure potential synergistic effects of multiple wavelengths on bacterial and viral inactivation and DNA and RNA damage. All five UV sources demonstrated similar inactivation of E. coli. For MS2, the 260 nm LED was most effective. For HAdV2 and B. pumilus, the MP UV lamp was most effective. When measuring electrical energy per order of reduction, the LP UV lamp was most efficient for inactivating E. coli and MS2; the LP UV and MP UV mercury lamps were equally efficient for HAdV2 and B. pumilus spores. Among the UV-C LEDs, there was no statistical difference in electrical efficiency for inactivating MS2, HAdV2, and B. pumilus spores. The 260 nm and 260|280 nm LEDs had a statistical energy advantage for E. coli inactivation. For UV-C LEDs to match the electrical efficiency per order of log reduction of conventional LP UV sources, they must reach efficiencies of 25-39% or be improved on by smart reactor design. No dual wavelength synergies were detected for bacterial and viral inactivation nor for DNA and RNA damage.

Title: Identification of unknown RNA partners using MAPS.
Abstract: Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing have led to an explosion in the rate of small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) discovery among bacteria. However, only a handful of them are functionally characterized. Most of the time, little to no targets are known. In Lalaouna et al. (2015), we proposed a new technology to uncover sRNAs targetome, which is based on the MS2-affinity purification (MAPS). We were able to prove its efficiency by applying it on well-characterized sRNAs of Escherichia coli. Thereafter, we adapted the procedure to other kind of RNA (mRNAs and tRNA-derived RNA fragments) and bacteria (pathogenic or Gram-positive strains). Here, we clearly report all improvements and adjustments made to MAPS technology since it was originally reported.

Title: Comparison of RNA extraction kits for the purification and detection of an enteric virus surrogate on green onions via RT-PCR.
Abstract: Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) offers a rapid and sensitive molecular method for detection of enteric viruses. Unfortunately, these assays are often hampered by the low virus titre found in foods and PCR inhibition due to matrix carryover during RNA extraction. Four commercial RNA extraction kits (Qiagen's QIAamp Viral RNA Mini and UltraSens Virus kits, MoBio UltraClean Tissue & Cells RNA Isolation kit, and Ambion MagMAX Viral RNA Isolation kit) were evaluated for their ability to extract and purify MS2 bacteriophage RNA, an enteric virus surrogate, from inoculated green onions, a food which has been associated with viral gastroenteritis outbreaks. Inoculated green onion wash concentrates and green onion pieces with and without Qiagen QIAshredder homogenization were assayed in the kit comparison. MS2 detection and PCR inhibition were evaluated using a duplex real-time RT-PCR for MS2 and an exogenous internal amplification control (IAC) assay. Without homogenization, MS2 inoculated at 40pfu/g was detected in at least 4 lots of green onion wash concentrates using the silica-membrane spin-column kits. Inhibition was a factor for the magnetic silica-based MagMAX kit, which resulted in detection of MS2 in 1 of 5. Addition of QIAshredder homogenization prior to extraction did not adversely affect the silica-membrane kit results but improved the MS2 detection by MagMAX to 5 of 5 lots. Use of a 1:10 dilution of primary RNA extracts also improved detection. The QIAamp Viral RNA Mini and MagMAX kits were further compared for detection of MS2 from green onion pieces inoculated at 20 and 5pfu/g.

Abstract: The aim of this research was to preliminary track fecal source male-specific F<sup>+</sup>RNA coliphages including human and animals in lettuce. At first, two published virus extraction procedures of ultracentrifugation and PEG precipitation were compared using DAL assay for determining the recovery efficiency in lettuce spiked artificially with three concentrations (10<sup>2</sup>, 10<sup>4</sup>, 10<sup>6</sup> pfu/100 ml) of MS2 coliphage. The results showed that PEG precipitation had the highest recovery in which the recovery efficiency at the spiked level of 10<sup>6</sup> pfu/100 ml was 16.63 %. Aqueous phase obtained from the final step of PEG method was applied for enumeration of coliphage and viral RNA extraction in naturally contaminated lettuce samples (N = 30) collected from two sources (market and farm). The samples were then analyzed based on (I, II, III, and IV primer sets) using RT-PCR method.

In the absence of model particles, MS2 aggregates formed in either 1mM NaCl at pH=3 or 50-200mM ionic strength CaCl<sub>2</sub> solutions at pH=7 led to a decrease in the MS2 inactivation efficacy because the virions located inside the aggregate were protected from the UV irradiation. In the presence of kaolinite and Microcystis aeruginosa, MS2 adsorbed onto the particles in either 1mM NaCl at pH=3 or 50-200mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> solutions at pH=7. In contrast to MS2 aggregates formed without the presence of particles, more MS2 virions adsorbed on these particles were exposed to UV irradiation to allow an increase in MS2 inactivation. In either 1mM NaCl at pH from 4 to 8 or 2-200mM NaCl solutions at pH=7, the absence of MS2 aggregation and adsorption onto the model particles explained why MS2 inactivation was not influenced by pH, ionic strength, and the presence of model particles in these conditions. The influence of virus adsorption and aggregation on the UV disinfection efficiency found in this research suggests the necessity of accounting for particles and cation composition in virus inactivation for drinking water.

Title: The Effect of Heat on the Physicochemical Properties of Bacteriophage MS2.
Abstract: The differences in physicochemical characteristics between infectious and non-infectious viral particles are poorly known. Even for heat, which is known as one of the most efficient treatments to inactivate enteric viruses, the global inactivation mechanisms have not been described yet. Such knowledge would help distinguish between both types of particles and therefore clarify the interpretation of the presence of viral genomes in food after heat treatment. In this study, we examined in particular the differences in electrostatic charge and hydrophobicity between the two particle types. MS2 phage, a common surrogate for enteric viruses, was used as a model virus. The heat-induced inactivation process of the infectious phages caused hydrophobic domains to be transiently exposed and their charge to become less negative. The particles also became progressively permeable to small molecules such as SYPRO Orange dye. The presence of non-infectious phage particles in which the genome was not accessible to RNases has been clearly demonstrated. These observations were done for MS2 phages exposed to a temperature of 60 °C. When exposed to a temperature higher than their critical temperature (72 °C), the particles were disrupted and the genome became available for RNases. At lower temperatures, 60 °C in this study, the transient expression of hydrophobic domains of remaining infectious phages appeared as an interesting parameter for improving their specific detection.

Title: Improving the collection efficiency of the liquid impinger for ultrafine particles and viral aerosols by applying granular bed filtration.
Abstract: Liquid impingers are utilized to collect bioaerosols for many advantages, such as avoiding dehydration of biological agents. However, many previous studies have reported that the liquid impingers are surprisingly inefficient for the collection of ultrafine bioaerosols, with collection efficiencies <30%. In the present work, we have successfully improved the collection efficiency of the liquid impinger (AGI30) to as high as 99% for particles in the size range of 20-400 nm with the aid of packed glass beads. We also systematically investigated the effects of influential factors on the collection efficiency. These factors include the volume of the sampling liquid (0, 20 and 30 mL), depth (0, 7 and 10 cm) of packed glass beads and sampling flow rate (4, 6 and 8 liter per min, lpm). According to our experimental results, increasing the depth of packed glass beads and the volume of sampling liquid can enhance the collection efficiency. Also, decreasing the sampling flow rate can increase the collection efficiency and reduce the loss of sampling liquid. For the sampling of viable MS2 phages, the collection efficiency of AGI30 sampler with packed glass beads is much higher than that without packed glass beads. Conclusively, this study validates that the granular bed filtration can enhance the collection efficiency of liquid impingers for submicron and ultrafine particles and viral aerosols.

Title: Combining Genes from Multiple Phages for Improved Cell Lysis and DNA Transfer from Escherichia coli to Bacillus subtilis.
Abstract: The ability to efficiently and reliably transfer genetic circuits between the key synthetic biology chassis, such as Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, constitutes one of the major hurdles of the rational genome engineering. Using lambda Red recombineering we integrated the thermosensitive lambda repressor and the lysis genes of several bacteriophages into the E. coli chromosome. The lysis of the engineered autolytic cells is inducible by a simple temperature shift. We improved the lysis efficiency by introducing different combinations of lysis genes from bacteriophages lambda, ΦX174 and MS2 under the control of the thermosensitive lambda repressor into the E. coli chromosome. We tested the engineered autolytic cells by transferring plasmid and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-borne genetic circuits from E. coli to B. subtilis. Our engineered system combines benefits of the two main synthetic biology chassis, E. coli and B. subtilis, and allows reliable and efficient transfer of DNA edited in E. coli into B. subtilis.

Title: Directed evolution using dCas9-targeted somatic hypermutation in mammalian cells.
Abstract: Engineering and study of protein function by directed evolution has been limited by the technical requirement to use global mutagenesis or introduce DNA libraries. Here, we develop CRISPR-X, a strategy to repurpose the somatic hypermutation machinery for protein engineering in situ. Using catalytically inactive dCas9 to recruit variants of cytidine deaminase (AID) with MS2-modified sgRNAs, we can specifically mutagenize endogenous targets with limited off-target damage. This generates diverse libraries of localized point mutations and can target multiple genomic locations simultaneously. We mutagenize GFP and select for spectrum-shifted variants, including EGFP. Additionally, we mutate the target of the cancer therapeutic bortezomib, PSMB5, and identify known and novel mutations that confer bortezomib resistance. Finally, using a hyperactive AID variant, we mutagenize loci both upstream and downstream of transcriptional start sites. These experiments illustrate a powerful approach to create complex libraries of genetic variants in native context, which is broadly applicable to investigate and improve protein function.

Title: Phenolic Compounds of Potato Peel Extracts: Their Antioxidant Activity and Protection against Human Enteric Viruses.
Abstract: Potato peels (PP) contain several bioactive compounds. These compounds are known to provide human health benefits, including antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. In addition, these compounds could have effects on human enteric viruses that have not yet been reported. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the phenolic composition, antioxidant properties in the acidified ethanol extract (AEE) and water extract of PP, and the antiviral effects on the inhibition of Av-05 and MS2 bacteriophages, which were used as human enteric viral surrogates. The AEE showed the highest phenolic content and antioxidant activity. Chlorogenic and caffeic acids were the major phenolic acids. In vitro analysis indicated that PP had a strong antioxidant activity. A 3 h incubation with AEE at a concentration of 5 mg/ml was needed to reduce the PFU/ml (plaque-forming unit per unit volume) of Av-05 and MS2 by 2.8 and 3.9 log₁₀, respectively, in a dose-dependent manner. Our data suggest that PP has potential to be a source of natural antioxidants against enteric viruses.

Title: Inactivation of Viruses and Bacteriophages as Models for Swine Hepatitis E Virus in Food Matrices.
Abstract: Hepatitis E virus has been recognised as a food-borne virus hazard in pork products, due to its zoonotic properties. This risk can be reduced by adequate treatment of the food to inactivate food-borne viruses. We used a spectrum of viruses and bacteriophages to evaluate the effect of three food treatments: high pressure processing (HPP), lactic acid (LA) and intense light pulse (ILP) treatments. On swine liver at 400 MPa for 10 min, HPP gave log<sub>10</sub> reductions of ≥4.2, ≥5.0 and 3.4 for feline calicivirus (FCV) 2280, FCV wildtype (wt) and murine norovirus 1 (MNV 1), respectively. Escherichia coli coliphage ϕX174 displayed a lower reduction of 1.1, while Escherichia coli coliphage MS2 was unaffected. For ham at 600 MPa, the corresponding reductions were 4.1, 4.4, 2.9, 1.7 and 1.3 log<sub>10</sub>. LA treatment at 2.2 M gave log<sub>10</sub> reductions in the viral spectrum of 0.29-2.1 for swine liver and 0.87-3.1 for ham, with ϕX174 and MNV 1, respectively, as the most stable microorganisms. The ILP treatment gave log<sub>10</sub> reductions of 1.6-2.8 for swine liver, 0.97-2.2 for ham and 1.3-2.3 for sausage, at 15-60 J cm<sup>-2</sup>, with MS2 as the most stable microorganism. The HPP treatment gave significantly (p < 0.05) greater virus reduction on swine liver than ham for the viruses at equivalent pressure/time combinations. For ILP treatment, reductions on swine liver were significantly (p < 0.05) greater than on ham for all microorganisms. The results presented here could be used in assessments of different strategies to protect consumers against virus contamination and in advice to food producers. Conservative model indicators for the pathogenic viruses could be suggested.

Title: Evaluation of propidium monoazide and long-amplicon qPCR as an infectivity assay for coliphage.
Abstract: Standardized and rapid assays for viable viral pathogens are needed to inform human health risk assessments. Conventional qPCR is designed to enumerate the gene copies of an organism in a sample, but does not identify those that originated from a viable pathogen. This study was undertaken to evaluate modified qPCR methods as infectivity assays for the enumeration of infectious MS2 coliphage. Propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment coupled with long-amplicon qPCR assays were assessed for their ability to quantify infectious MS2 in pure cultures and following inactivation by a range of UV light exposures and chlorine doses. The qPCR results were compared to the plaque assay, which was used as the standard to indicate the level of infectious MS2 in each sample. For pure cultures, PMA-qPCR results were not significantly different from the plaque assay (p>0.05). At >4 log inactivation, combined PMA and long-amplicon qPCR assays overestimated the level of infectious MS2 remaining (p<0.05). The most accurate long-amplicon qPCR infectivity assay targeted a 624-bp region at the 5' end of the genome. Modified qPCR approaches may be useful tools to monitor the loss of infectivity as a result of disinfection processes.

Title: A Catalytic Nanoreactor Based on in Vivo Encapsulation of Multiple Enzymes in an Engineered Protein Nanocompartment.
Abstract: Bacterial protein compartments concentrate and sequester enzymes, thereby regulating biochemical reactions. Here, we generated a new functional nanocompartment in Escherichia coli by engineering the MS2 phage capsid protein to encapsulate multiple cargo proteins. Sequestration of multiple proteins in MS2-based capsids was achieved by SpyTag/SpyCatcher protein fusions that covalently crosslinked with the interior surface of the capsid. Further, the functional two-enzyme indigo biosynthetic pathway could be targeted to the engineered capsids, leading to a 60 % increase in indigo production in vivo. The enzyme-loaded particles could be purified in their active form and showed enhanced long-term stability in vitro (about 95 % activity after seven days) compared with free enzymes (about 5 % activity after seven days). In summary, this engineered in vivo encapsulation system provides a simple and versatile way for generating highly stable multi-enzyme nanoreactors for in vivo and in vitro applications.

Title: Antimicrobial filtration with electrospun poly(vinyl alcohol) nanofibers containing benzyl triethylammonium chloride: Immersion, leaching, toxicity, and filtration tests.
Abstract: Antimicrobial electrospun poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) nanofibers were synthesized by impregnating benzyl triethylammonium chloride (BTEAC) as an antimicrobial agent into PVA nanofibers. The BTEAC-PVA nanofibers were heat-methanol treated during the preparation for various tests. The BTEAC-PVA nanofibers became more hydrophilic than the PVA nanofibers due to incorporation of BTEAC. Through heat-methanol treatment, thermal property, crystallinity, and water stability of BTEAC-PVA nanofibers were improved considerably. The immersion test shows that heat-methanol treatment has an advantage over heat treatment to maintain BTEAC content in BTEAC-PVA nanofibers. The acute toxicity test demonstrates that the 24-h EC<sub>50</sub> and 48-h EC<sub>50</sub> values (EC<sub>50</sub> = median effective concentration) of BTEAC to Daphnia magna were 113 and 90 mg/L, respectively. The leaching test indicates that the BTEAC concentration leached from BTEAC-PVA nanofibers was far below the concentration affecting the immobilization of D. magna. For antimicrobial filtration tests, the BTEAC-PVA nanofibers were deposited onto glass fiber filter. The antimicrobial filtration test was conducted against bacteria (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus) and bacteriophages (MS2, PhiX174), demonstrating that the BTEAC-PVA nanofibers could enhance the removal of E. coli and S. aureus considerably but not the removal of MS2 and PhiX174 under dynamic flow conditions.

Title: Marine Phages As Tracers: Effects of Size, Morphology, and Physico-Chemical Surface Properties on Transport in a Porous Medium.
Abstract: Although several studies examined the transport of viruses in terrestrial systems only few studies exist on the use of marine phages (i.e., nonterrestrial viruses infecting marine host bacteria) as sensitively detectable microbial tracers for subsurface colloid transport and water flow. Here, we systematically quantified and compared for the first time the effects of size, morphology and physicochemical surface properties of six marine phages and two coliphages (MS2, T4) on transport in sand-filled percolated columns. Phage-sand interactions were described by colloidal filtration theory and the extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek approach (XDLVO), respectively. The phages belonged to different families and comprised four phages never used in transport studies (i.e., PSA-HM1, PSA-HP1, PSA-HS2, and H3/49). Phage transport was influenced by size, morphology and hydrophobicity in an approximate order of size > hydrophobicity ≥ morphology. Two phages PSA-HP1, PSA-HS2 (Podoviridae and Siphoviridae) exhibited similar mass recovery as commonly used coliphage MS2 and were 7-fold better transported than known marine phage vB_PSPS-H40/1. Differing properties of the marine phages may be used to trace transport of indigenous viruses, natural colloids or anthropogenic nanomaterials and, hence, contribute to better risk analysis. Our results underpin the potential role of marine phages as microbial tracer for transport of colloidal particles and water flow.

Title: Genetic, Structural, and Phenotypic Properties of MS2 Coliphage with Resistance to ClO<sub>2</sub> Disinfection.
Abstract: Common water disinfectants like chlorine have been reported to select for resistant viruses, yet little attention has been devoted to characterizing disinfection resistance. Here, we investigated the resistance of MS2 coliphage to inactivation by chlorine dioxide (ClO<sub>2</sub>). ClO<sub>2</sub> inactivates MS2 by degrading its structural proteins, thereby disrupting the ability of MS2 to attach to and infect its host. ClO<sub>2</sub>-resistant virus populations emerged not only after repeated cycles of ClO<sub>2</sub> disinfection followed by regrowth but also after dilution-regrowth cycles in the absence of ClO<sub>2</sub>. The resistant populations exhibited several fixed mutations which caused the substitution of ClO<sub>2</sub>-labile by ClO<sub>2</sub>-stable amino acids. On a phenotypic level, these mutations resulted in a more stable host binding during inactivation compared to the wild-type, thus resulting in a greater ability to maintain infectivity. This conclusion was supported by cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of the virus particle, which demonstrated that most structural modification occurred in the putative A protein, an important binding factor. Resistance was specific to the inactivation mechanism of ClO<sub>2</sub> and did not result in significant cross-resistance to genome-damaging disinfectants. Overall, our data indicate that resistant viruses may emerge even in the absence of ClO<sub>2</sub> pressure but that they can be inactivated by other common disinfectants.

Abstract: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the pathogen causing hepatitis E (HE). It arouses global public health concern since it is a zoonotic disease. The objective of this letter is to report a cost-effective internal control prepared for monitoring procedures of HEV reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR detection. A selected conserved HEV RNA fragment was integrated into the downstream of the truncated MS2 bacteriophage genome based on Armored RNA technology. The resulting MS2-HEV gene harbored by the pET-28b-MS2-HEV plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) for expression analysis by SDS-PAGE. The expression products were purified and concentrated by ultrasonication and ultrafiltration separation. The morphology and stability properties of the virus-like particles (VLPs) were evaluated by electron microscopy scanning and nuclease challenges, respectively. SDS-PAGE results showed that the constructed MS2-HEV gene expressed efficiently and the purity of the VLPs was highly consistent with the result in electron microscopy. Stability evaluation results demonstrated that the prepared VLPs exhibited strong resistance to DNase I and RNase A attacks and also performed long-lasting protection of coated HEV RNA for at least 4 months at -20°C. These data revealed that the prepared VLPs meet the basic requirements of use as internal control material in the HEV RNA amplification assay.

Title: Biodistribution of Antibody-MS2 Viral Capsid Conjugates in Breast Cancer Models.
Abstract: A variety of nanoscale scaffolds, including virus-like particles (VLPs), are being developed for biomedical applications; however, little information is available about their in vivo behavior. Targeted nanoparticles are particularly valuable as diagnostic and therapeutic carriers because they can increase the signal-to-background ratio of imaging agents, improve the efficacy of drugs, and reduce adverse effects by concentrating the therapeutic molecule in the region of interest. The genome-free capsid of bacteriophage MS2 has several features that make it well-suited for use in delivery applications, such as facile production and modification, the ability to display multiple copies of targeting ligands, and the capacity to deliver large payloads. Anti-EGFR antibodies were conjugated to MS2 capsids to construct nanoparticles targeted toward receptors overexpressed on breast cancer cells. The MS2 agents showed good stability in physiological conditions up to 2 days and specific binding to the targeted receptors in in vitro experiments. Capsids radiolabeled with <sup>64</sup>Cu isotopes were injected into mice possessing tumor xenografts, and both positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) and scintillation counting of the organs ex vivo were used to determine the localization of the agents. The capsids exhibit surprisingly long circulation times (10-15% ID/g in blood at 24 h) and moderate tumor uptake (2-5% ID/g). However, the targeting antibodies did not lead to increased uptake in vivo despite in vitro enhancements, suggesting that extravasation is a limiting factor for delivery to tumors by these particles.

Title: [Preparation and Characterization of Recombinant HEV RNA-loaded MS2 Bacteriophage Capsid by Armored RNA Technology].
Abstract: The purpose of this study was to develop an effective control to be applied in hepatitis E virus(HEV)nucleic acid detection.Construction of an MS2/HEV gene was performed based on an "Armored RNA technology" protocol. The gene included a partial MS2 phage genome including the 5’UTR,the maturation protein, capsid protein and initiation site of the replicase and a partially conserved sequence derived from the HEV ORF2.The target genes were synthesized and amplified by PCR, and the purified target gene products subcloned into the pET-28 b prokaryotic expression vector to obtain the pET-28b-MS2/HEV recombinant plasmid. SDS-PAGE was used for expression analysis in E. coli BL21(DE3)cells harboring the pET-28b-MS2/HEV plasmid. Centrifugal ultrafiltration was adopted for the purification and concentration of recombinant HEV RNA-loaded MS2 Bacteriophage Capsid (rHEPC). The morphological identification of the particles was subsequently performed by scanning electron microscopy. Stability of the rHEPC particles were evaluated by challenging with different concentrations of DNase I and RNase A, and also evaluated for long-term storage based on RT-PCR verification. SDS-PAGE results showed that the target MS2/HEV gene could express efficiently in recombinant E. coli BL21(DE3)and RT-PCR results revealed that the designed HEV conserved gene sequence was successfully packaged into MS2phage-like or rHEPC particles. Stability evaluation showed that the prepared rHEPC particles exhibited strong resistance to degradation by DNase I and RNase A and long-lasting protection of coated HEV RNA for at least seven months when stored at-20℃.The prepared rHEPC particles in the present study meet the basic requirements to be used as a quality control material for routine HEV nucleic acid detection.

Title: Bactericidal and virucidal mechanisms in the alkaline disinfection of compost using calcium lime and ash.
Abstract: In the present study, the bactericidal and virucidal mechanisms in the alkaline disinfection of compost with calcium lime and ash were investigated. Two indicator microorganisms, Escherichia coli and MS2 coliphage, were used as surrogates for enteric pathogens. The alkaline-treated compost with calcium oxide (CaO) or ash resulted primarily in damage to the outer membrane and enzyme activities of E. coli. The alkaline treatment of compost also led to the infectivity loss of the coliphage because of the partial capsid damage and RNA exteriorization due to a raised pH, which is proportional to the amount of alkaline agents added. These results indicate that the alkaline treatment of compost using calcium oxide and ash is effective and can contribute to the safe usage of compost from a mixing type dry toilet.

Title: Asymmetric cryo-EM reconstruction of phage MS2 reveals genome structure in situ.
Abstract: In single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses, virus capsid assembly and genome packaging are intertwined processes. Using cryo-electron microscopy and single particle analysis we determined the asymmetric virion structure of bacteriophage MS2, which includes 178 copies of the coat protein, a single copy of the A-protein and the RNA genome. This reveals that in situ, the viral RNA genome can adopt a defined conformation.

Title: A Selection for Assembly Reveals That a Single Amino Acid Mutant of the Bacteriophage MS2 Coat Protein Forms a Smaller Virus-like Particle.
Abstract: Virus-like particles are used to encapsulate drugs, imaging agents, enzymes, and other biologically active molecules in order to enhance their function. However, the size of most virus-like particles is inflexible, precluding the design of appropriately sized containers for different applications. Here, we describe a chromatographic selection for virus-like particle assembly. Using this selection, we identified a single amino acid substitution to the coat protein of bacteriophage MS2 that mediates a uniform switch in particle geometry from T = 3 to T = 1 icosahedral symmetry. The resulting smaller particle retains the ability to be disassembled and reassembled in vitro and to be chemically modified to load cargo into its interior cavity. The pair of 27 and 17 nm MS2 particles will allow direct examination of the effect of size on function in established applications of virus-like particles, including drug delivery and imaging.

Title: Use of ATP Readings to Predict a Successful Hygiene Intervention in the Workplace to Reduce the Spread of Viruses on Fomites.
Abstract: The purpose of this study was to validate the use of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for evaluating hygiene intervention effectiveness in reducing viral dissemination in an office environment. The bacterial virus MS-2 was used to evaluate two scenarios, one where the hand of an individual was contaminated and another where a fomite was contaminated. MS-2 was selected as a model because its shape and size are similar to many human pathogenic viruses. Two separate experiments were conducted, one in which the entrance door push plate was inoculated and the other in which the hand of one selected employee was inoculated. In both scenarios, 54 selected surfaces in the office were tested to assess the dissemination of the virus within the office. Associated surface contamination was also measured employing an ATP meter. More than half of the tested hands and surfaces in the office were contaminated with MS-2 within 4 h. Next, an intervention was conducted, and each scenario was repeated. Half of the participating employees were provided hand sanitizer, facial tissues, and disinfecting wipes, and were instructed in their use. A significant (p < 0.05) reduction was observed in the number of surfaces contaminated with virus. This reduction in viral spread was evident from the results of both viral culture and the surface ATP measurements, although there was no direct correlation between ATP measurements with respect to viral concentration. Although ATP does not measure viruses, these results demonstrate that ATP measurements could be useful for evaluating the effectiveness of hygiene interventions aimed at preventing viral spread in the workplace.

Title: Assessment of Self-Contamination During Removal of Personal Protective Equipment for Ebola Patient Care.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE Ebola virus disease (EVD) places healthcare personnel (HCP) at high risk for infection during patient care, and personal protective equipment (PPE) is critical. Protocols for EVD PPE doffing have not been validated for prevention of viral self-contamination. Using surrogate viruses (non-enveloped MS2 and enveloped Φ6), we assessed self-contamination of skin and clothes when trained HCP doffed EVD PPE using a standardized protocol. METHODS A total of 15 HCP donned EVD PPE for this study. Virus was applied to PPE, and a trained monitor guided them through the doffing protocol. Of the 15 participants, 10 used alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) for glove and hand hygiene and 5 used hypochlorite for glove hygiene and ABHR for hand hygiene. Inner gloves, hands, face, and scrubs were sampled after doffing. RESULTS After doffing, MS2 virus was detected on the inner glove worn on the dominant hand for 8 of 15 participants, on the non-dominant inner glove for 6 of 15 participants, and on scrubs for 2 of 15 participants. All MS2 on inner gloves was observed when ABHR was used for glove hygiene; none was observed when hypochlorite was used. When using hypochlorite for glove hygiene, 1 participant had MS2 on hands, and 1 had MS2 on scrubs. CONCLUSIONS A structured doffing protocol using a trained monitor and ABHR protects against enveloped virus self-contamination. Non-enveloped virus (MS2) contamination was detected on inner gloves, possibly due to higher resistance to ABHR. Doffing protocols protective against all viruses need to incorporate highly effective glove and hand hygiene agents. Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2016;1-6.

Title: Oligomeric Conjugated Polyelectrolytes Display Site-Preferential Binding to an MS2 Viral Capsid.
Abstract: Opportunistic bacteria and viruses are a worldwide health threat prompting the need to develop new targeting modalities. A class of novel synthetic poly(phenylene ethynylene) (PPE)-based oligomeric conjugated polyelectrolytes (OPEs) have demonstrated potent wide-spectrum biocidal activity. A subset of cationic OPEs display high antiviral activity against the MS2 bacteriophage. The oligomers have been found to inactivate the bacteriophage and perturb the morphology of the MS2 viral capsid. However, details of the initial binding and interactions between the OPEs and the viruses are not well understood. In this study, we use a multiscale computational approach, including random sampling, molecular dynamics, and electronic structure calculations, to gain an understanding of the molecular-level interactions of a series of OPEs that vary in length, charge, and functional groups with the MS2 capsid. Our results show that OPEs strongly bind to the MS2 capsid protein assembly with binding energies of up to -30 kcal/mol. Free-energy analysis shows that the binding is dominated by strong van der Waals interactions between the hydrophobic OPE backbone and the capsid surface and strong electrostatic free energy contributions between the OPE charged moieties and charged residues on the capsid surface. This knowledge provides molecular-level insight into how to tailor the OPEs to optimize viral capsid disruption and increase OPE efficacy to target amphiphilic protein coats of icosahedral-based viruses.

Title: Novel miR-122 delivery system based on MS2 virus like particle surface displaying cell-penetrating peptide TAT for hepatocellular carcinoma.
Abstract: Current treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have shown inadequate. MicroRNA-122 (miR-122) mediated RNA interference brings new prospects. A safe, efficient miRNA delivery system is an indispensable assurance. Previously, we developed an MS2 bacteriophage virus-like particle (VLP)-based microRNA delivery system crosslinked with the HIV TAT peptide, which served as an effective inhibitor in the treatments of systemic lupus erythematosus and osteoporosis. However, defects, such as low crosslinking efficiency, high cost, and potential toxicity of the crosslinking agent, needed to be confronted. Therefore, TAT peptide was designed to display on the surface of MS2 VLPs, instead of being chemically crosslinked, using the platform of phage surface display. The results reflected that MS2 VLPs displaying TAT could effectively penetrate the cytomembrane and deliver miR-122. Additionally, its inhibitory effects on HCC were significant in Hep3B, HepG2, and Huh7 cells and Hep3B related animal models. Thus, we have established a novel miR-122 delivery system based on MS2 VLPs surface displaying TAT peptide, which could effectively perform the function of penetrating cytomembrane and the inhibition of HCC.

The approach of surface displaying the TAT peptide on MS2 VLPs could be adapted for targeting E. coli. However, since the study primarily focuses on a different disease model and therapeutic agent, it may need additional evaluation and modification to ensure its efficacy against multidrug-resistant E. coli.\n\nRating: 6/10', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)

Title: The allosteric switching mechanism in bacteriophage MS2.
Abstract: We use all-atom simulations to elucidate the mechanisms underlying conformational switching and allostery within the coat protein of the bacteriophage MS2. Assembly of most icosahedral virus capsids requires that the capsid protein adopts different conformations at precise locations within the capsid. It has been shown that a 19 nucleotide stem loop (TR) from the MS2 genome acts as an allosteric effector, guiding conformational switching of the coat protein during capsid assembly. Since the principal conformational changes occur far from the TR binding site, it is important to understand the molecular mechanism underlying this allosteric communication. To this end, we use all-atom simulations with explicit water combined with a path sampling technique to sample the MS2 coat protein conformational transition, in the presence and absence of TR-binding. The calculations find that TR binding strongly alters the transition free energy profile, leading to a switch in the favored conformation. We discuss changes in molecular interactions responsible for this shift. We then identify networks of amino acids with correlated motions to reveal the mechanism by which effects of TR binding span the protein. We find that TR binding strongly affects residues located at the 5-fold and quasi-sixfold interfaces in the assembled capsid, suggesting a mechanism by which the TR binding could direct formation of the native capsid geometry. The analysis predicts amino acids whose substitution by mutagenesis could alter populations of the conformational substates or their transition rates.

Title: The effect of chlorine and combined chlorine/UV treatment on coliphages in drinking water disinfection.
Abstract: Chlorine disinfection is a globally used method to ensure the safety of drinking water. However, it has not always been successful against viruses and, therefore, it is important to find new methods to disinfect water. Seventeen different coliphages were isolated from the treated municipal wastewater. These coliphages and MS2 were treated with different dosages of chlorine in drinking water, and a combined chlorine/ultraviolet irradiation treatment for the chlorine-resistant coliphages. Chlorine disinfection with 0.3-0.5 mg/L total chlorine (free Cl-dosage 0.12-0.21 mg/L) for 10 min achieved 2.5-5.7 Log10-reductions for 11 sensitive coliphages. The six most resistant coliphages showed no reduction with these chlorine concentrations. MS2 was intermediate in chlorine resistance, and thus it is not a good indicator for viruses in chlorine disinfection. In the combined treatment total chlorine of 0.05-0.25 mg/L (free Cl-dosage 0.02-0.08 mg/L) and ultraviolet irradiation (14-22 mWs/cm(2)) were more effective than chlorine alone, and 3-5 Log10-reductions were achieved for the chlorine-resistant strains. The chlorination efficiency could be increased by higher dosages and longer contact times, but this could increase the formation of disinfection by-products. Therefore, the combination treatment is a recommended disinfection method.

Title: Ammonia as an In Situ Sanitizer: Influence of Virus Genome Type on Inactivation.
Abstract: Treatment of human excreta and animal manure (HEAM) is key in controlling the spread of persistent enteric pathogens, such as viruses. The extent of virus inactivation during HEAM storage and treatment appears to vary with virus genome type, although the reasons for this variability are not clear. Here, we investigated the inactivation of viruses of different genome types under conditions representative of HEAM storage or mesophilic digestion. The goals were to characterize the influence of HEAM solution conditions on inactivation and to determine the potential mechanisms involved. Specifically, eight viruses representing the four viral genome types (single-stranded RNA [ssRNA], double-stranded RNA [dsRNA], single-stranded DNA [ssDNA], and double-stranded DNA [dsDNA]) were exposed to synthetic solutions with well-controlled temperature (20 to 35°C), pH (8 to 9), and ammonia (NH3) concentrations (0 to 40 mmol liter(-1)). DNA and dsRNA viruses were considerably more resistant than ssRNA viruses, resulting in up to 1,000-fold-longer treatment times to reach a 4-log inactivation. The apparently slower inactivation of DNA viruses was rationalized by the higher stability of DNA than that of ssRNA in HEAM. Pushing the system toward harsher pH (>9) and temperature (>35°C) conditions, such as those encountered in thermophilic digestion and alkaline treatments, led to more consistent inactivation kinetics among ssRNA and other viruses. This suggests that the dependence of inactivation on genome type disappeared in favor of protein-mediated inactivation mechanisms common to all viruses. Finally, we recommend the use of MS2 as a conservative indicator to assess the inactivation of ssRNA viruses and the stable ΦX174 or dsDNA phages as indicators for persistent viruses.

Title: Tethered Function Assays as Tools to Elucidate the Molecular Roles of RNA-Binding Proteins.
Abstract: Dynamic regulation of RNA molecules is critical to the survival and development of cells. Messenger RNAs are transcribed in the nucleus as intron-containing pre-mRNAs and bound by RNA-binding proteins, which control their fate by regulating RNA stability, splicing, polyadenylation, translation, and cellular localization. Most RBPs have distinct mRNA-binding and functional domains; thus, the function of an RBP can be studied independently of RNA-binding by artificially recruiting the RBP to a reporter RNA and then measuring the effect of RBP recruitment on reporter splicing, stability, translational efficiency, or intracellular trafficking. These tethered function assays therefore do not require prior knowledge of the RBP's endogenous RNA targets or its binding sites within these RNAs. Here, we provide an overview of the experimental strategy and the strengths and limitations of common tethering systems. We illustrate specific examples of the application of the assay in elucidating the function of various classes of RBPs. We also discuss how classic tethering assay approaches and insights gained from them have been empowered by more recent technological advances, including efficient genome editing and high-throughput RNA-sequencing.

Title: In Vivo RNA Visualization in Plants Using MS2 Tagging.
Abstract: Intracellular trafficking and asymmetric localization of RNA molecules within cells are a prevalent process across phyla involved in developmental control and signaling and thus in the determination of cell fate. In addition to intracellular localization, plants support the trafficking of RNA molecules also between cells through plasmodesmata (PD), which has important roles in the cell-to-cell and systemic communication during plant growth and development. Viruses have developed strategies to exploit the underlying plant RNA transport mechanisms for the cell-to-cell and systemic dissemination of infection. In vivo RNA visualization methods have revolutionized the study of RNA dynamics in living cells. However, their application in plants is still in its infancy. To gain insights into the RNA transport mechanisms in plants, we study the localization and transport of Tobacco mosaic virus RNA using MS2 tagging. This technique involves the tagging of the RNA of interest with repeats of an RNA stem-loop (SL) that is derived from the origin of assembly of the bacteriophage MS2 and recruits the MS2 coat protein (MCP). Thus, expression of MCP fused to a fluorescent marker allows the specific visualization of the SL-carrying RNA. Here we describe a detailed protocol for Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transient expression and in vivo visualization of MS2-tagged mRNAs in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves.

Title: Imaging Single mRNA Dynamics in Live Neurons and Brains.
Abstract: RNA is a key player in the process of gene expression. Whereas fluorescence in situ hybridization allows single mRNA imaging in fixed cells, the MS2-GFP labeling technique enables the observation of mRNA dynamics in living cells. Recently, two genetically engineered mouse models have been developed for the application of the MS2-GFP system in live animals. First, the Actb-MBS mouse was generated by knocking in 24 repeats of the MS2 stem-loop sequence in the 3' untranslated region of the β-actin gene. Second, the MCP mouse was made to express the NLS-HA-MCP-GFP transgene in all cell types. By crossing Actb-MBS and MCP mice, a double homozygous mouse line, MCP×MBS, was established to visualize endogenous β-actin mRNA labeled with multiple green fluorescent proteins. By imaging hippocampal neurons or brain slices from MCP×MBS mice, the dynamics of mRNA, such as transcription, transport, and localization, can be studied at single mRNA resolution. In this chapter, we explain the basics of MCP×MBS mice and describe methods for utilizing these animals.

Title: Partitioning of Viruses in Wastewater Systems and Potential for Aerosolization.
Abstract: To gain insight into the potential for aerosolization of viruses in wastewater systems, we investigated the partitioning of MS2 and Phi6 bacteriophages in synthetic sludge and anaerobically digested sludge from a wastewater treatment plant. We evaluated partitioning among the liquid, solids, and material surfaces of porcelain, concrete, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polypropylene. In all cases, at least 94% of the virions partitioned into the liquid fraction. In real sludge, no more than 0.8% of virions partitioned to the solids and no more than 6% to the material surface. Both MS2 and Phi6 partitioned more to the surface of concrete and polypropylene than to the surface of porcelain or PVC. Partitioning of viruses in wastewater among the liquid, biosolids, and material surface does not appear to mitigate the potential for aerosolization of virus, as most of the virus remains in the liquid phase.

Title: Use of RNA amplification and electrophoresis for studying virus aerosol collection efficiency and their comparison with plaque assays.
Abstract: The spread of virus-induced infectious diseases through airborne routes of transmission is a global concern for economic and medical reasons. To study virus transmission, it is essential to have an effective aerosol collector such as the growth tube collector (GTC) system that utilizes water-based condensation for collecting virus-containing aerosols. In this work, we characterized the GTC system using bacteriophage MS2 as a surrogate for a small RNA virus. We investigated using RNA extraction and reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to study the total virus collection efficiency of the GTC system. Plaque assays were also used to enumerate viable viruses collected by the GTC system compared to that by a commercially available apparatus, the SKC® Biosampler. The plaque assay counts were used to enumerate viable viruses whereas RT-PCR provides a total virus count, including those viruses inactivated during collection. The effects of relative humidity (RH) and other conditions on collection efficiency were also investigated. Our results suggest that the GTC has a collection efficiency for viable viruses between 0.24 and 1.8% and a total virus collection efficiency between 18.3 and 79.0%, which is 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than that of the SKC® Biosampler. Moreover, higher RH significantly increases both the viable and total collection efficiency of the GTC, while its effect on the collection efficiency of the SKC® Biosampler is not significant.

Title: Bacteriophage MS2 genomic RNA encodes an assembly instruction manual for its capsid.
Abstract: Using RNA-coat protein crosslinking we have shown that the principal RNA recognition surface on the interior of infectious MS2 virions overlaps with the known peptides that bind the high affinity translational operator, TR, within the phage genome. The data also reveal the sequences of genomic fragments in contact with the coat protein shell. These show remarkable overlap with previous predictions based on the hypothesis that virion assembly is mediated by multiple sequences-specific contacts at RNA sites termed Packaging Signals (PSs). These PSs are variations on the TR stem-loop sequence and secondary structure. They act co-operatively to regulate the dominant assembly pathway and ensure cognate RNA encapsidation. In MS2, they also trigger conformational change in the dimeric capsomere creating the A/B quasi-conformer, 60 of which are needed to complete the <i>T</i>=3 capsid. This is the most compelling demonstration to date that this ssRNA virus, and by implications potentially very many of them, assemble via a PS-mediated assembly mechanism.

Title: Investigation of enteric adenovirus and poliovirus removal by coagulation processes and suitability of bacteriophages MS2 and φX174 as surrogates for those viruses.
Abstract: We evaluated the removal of enteric adenovirus (AdV) type 40 and poliovirus (PV) type 1 by coagulation, using water samples from 13 water sources for drinking water treatment plants in Japan. The behaviors of two widely accepted enteric virus surrogates, bacteriophages MS2 and φX174, were compared with the behaviors of AdV and PV. Coagulation with polyaluminum chloride (PACl, basicity 1.5) removed AdV and PV from virus-spiked source waters: the infectious AdV and PV removal ratios evaluated by means of a plaque-forming-unit method were 0.1-1.4-log10 and 0.5-2.4-log10, respectively. A nonsulfated high-basicity PACl (basicity 2.1) removed infectious AdV and PV more efficiently than did other commercially available PACls (basicity 1.5-2.1), alum, and ferric chloride. The MS2 removal ratios tended to be larger than those of AdV and PV, partly because of differences in the hydrophobicities of the virus particles and the sensitivity of the virus to the virucidal activity of PACl; the differences in removal ratios were not due to differences in the surface charges of the virus particles. MS2, which was more hydrophobic than the other viruses, was inactivated during coagulation with PACl. Therefore, MS2 does not appear to be an appropriate surrogate for AdV and PV during coagulation. In contrast, because φX174, like AdV and PV, was not inactivated during coagulation, and because the hydrophobicity of φX174 was similar to or somewhat lower than the hydrophobicities of AdV and PV, the φX174 removal ratios tended to be similar to or somewhat smaller than those of the enteric viruses. Therefore, φX174 is a potential conservative surrogate for AdV and PV during coagulation. In summary, the surface hydrophobicity of virus particles and the sensitivity of the virus to the virucidal activity of the coagulant are probably important determinants of the efficiency of virus removal during coagulation.

Title: Symmetry-adapted digital modeling III. Coarse-grained icosahedral viruses.
Abstract: Considered is the coarse-grained modeling of icosahedral viruses in terms of a three-dimensional lattice (the digital modeling lattice) selected among the projected points in space of a six-dimensional icosahedral lattice. Backbone atomic positions (Cα's for the residues of the capsid and phosphorus atoms P for the genome nucleotides) are then indexed by their nearest lattice point. This leads to a fine-grained lattice point characterization of the full viral chains in the backbone approximation (denoted as digital modeling). Coarse-grained models then follow by a proper selection of the indexed backbone positions, where for each chain one can choose the desired coarseness. This approach is applied to three viruses, the Satellite tobacco mosaic virus, the bacteriophage MS2 and the Pariacoto virus, on the basis of structural data from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank.

Title: Survivability, Partitioning, and Recovery of Enveloped Viruses in Untreated Municipal Wastewater.
Abstract: Many of the devastating pandemics and outbreaks of the 20th and 21st centuries have involved enveloped viruses, including influenza, HIV, SARS, MERS, and Ebola. However, little is known about the presence and fate of enveloped viruses in municipal wastewater. Here, we compared the survival and partitioning behavior of two model enveloped viruses (MHV and ϕ6) and two nonenveloped bacteriophages (MS2 and T3) in raw wastewater samples. We showed that MHV and ϕ6 remained infective on the time scale of days. Up to 26% of the two enveloped viruses adsorbed to the solid fraction of wastewater compared to 6% of the two nonenveloped viruses. Based on this partitioning behavior, we assessed and optimized methods for recovering enveloped viruses from wastewater. Our optimized ultrafiltration method resulted in mean recoveries (±SD) of 25.1% (±3.6%) and 18.2% (±9.5%) for the enveloped MHV and ϕ6, respectively, and mean recoveries of 55.6% (±16.7%) and 85.5% (±24.5%) for the nonenveloped MS2 and T3, respectively. A maximum of 3.7% of MHV and 2% of MS2 could be recovered from the solids. These results shed light on the environmental fate of an important group of viruses and the presented methods will enable future research on enveloped viruses in water environments.

Title: Spatiotemporal Control of Type III-A CRISPR-Cas Immunity: Coupling DNA Degradation with the Target RNA Recognition.
Abstract: Streptococcus thermophilus (St) type III-A CRISPR-Cas system restricts MS2 RNA phage and cuts RNA in vitro. However, the CRISPR array spacers match DNA phages, raising the question: does the St CRISPR-Cas system provide immunity by erasing phage mRNA or/and by eliminating invading DNA? We show that it does both. We find that (1) base-pairing between crRNA and target RNA activates single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) degradation by StCsm; (2) ssDNase activity is confined to the HD-domain of Cas10; (3) target RNA cleavage by the Csm3 RNase suppresses Cas10 DNase activity, ensuring temporal control of DNA degradation; and (4) base-pairing between crRNA 5'-handle and target RNA 3'-flanking sequence inhibits Cas10 ssDNase to prevent self-targeting. We propose that upon phage infection, crRNA-guided StCsm binding to the emerging transcript recruits Cas10 DNase to the actively transcribed phage DNA, resulting in degradation of both the transcript and phage DNA, but not the host DNA.

Title: Inactivation of Escherichia coli, Bacteriophage MS2, and Bacillus Spores under UV/H2O2 and UV/Peroxydisulfate Advanced Disinfection Conditions.
Abstract: Ultraviolet light (UV) combined with peroxy chemicals, such as H2O2 and peroxydisulfate (PDS), have been considered potentially highly effective disinfection processes. This study investigated the inactivation of Escherichia coli, bacteriophage MS2, and Bacillus subtilis spores as surrogates for pathogens under UV/H2O2 and UV/PDS conditions, with the aim to provide further understanding of UV-based advanced disinfection processes (ADPs). Results showed that one additional log of inactivation of E. coli was achieved with 0.3 mM H2O2 or PDS at 5.2 × 10(-5) Einstein·L(-1) photo fluence (at 254 nm) compared with UV irradiation alone. Addition of H2O2 and PDS greatly enhanced the inactivation rate of MS2 by around 15 folds and 3 folds, respectively, whereas the inactivation of B. subtilis spores was slightly enhanced. Reactive species responsible for the inactivation were identified to be •OH, SO4(·-), and CO3(·-) based on manipulation of solution conditions. The CT value of each reactive species was calculated with respect to each microbial surrogate, which showed that the disinfection efficacy ranked as •OH > SO4(·-) > CO3(·-) ≫ O2(·-)/HO2(·). A comprehensive dynamic model was developed and successfully predicted the inactivation of the microbial surrogates in surface water and wastewater matrices. The concepts of UV-efficiency and EE/O were employed to provide a cost-effective evaluation for UV-based ADPs. Overall, the present study suggests that it will be beneficial to upgrade UV disinfection to UV/H2O2 ADP for the inactivation of viral pathogens.

Title: Armored long non-coding RNA MEG3 targeting EGFR based on recombinant MS2 bacteriophage virus-like particles against hepatocellular carcinoma.
Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers worldwide. However, the treatment of patients with HCC is particularly challenging. Long non-coding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) has been identified as a potential suppressor of several types of tumors, but the delivery of long RNA remains problematic, limiting its applications. In the present study, we designed a novel delivery system based on MS2 virus-like particles (VLPs) crosslinked with GE11 polypeptide. This vector was found to be fast, effective and safe for the targeted delivery of lncRNA MEG3 RNA to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-positive HCC cell lines without the activation of EGFR downstream pathways, and significantly attenuated both in vitro and in vivo tumor cell growth. Our study also revealed that the targeted delivery was mainly dependent on clathrin-mediated endocytosis and MEG3 RNA suppresses tumor growth mainly via increasing the expression of p53 and its downstream gene GDF15, but decreasing the expression of MDM2. Thus, this vector is promising as a novel delivery system and may facilitate a new approach to lncRNA based cancer therapy.

Title: Scalable chromatography-based purification of virus-like particle carrier for epitope based influenza A vaccine produced in Escherichia coli.
Abstract: Virus-like particles (VLPs) are promising molecular structures for the design and construction of novel vaccines, diagnostic tools, and gene therapy vectors. Size, oligomer assembly and repetitiveness of epitopes are optimal features to induce strong immune responses. Several VLP-based vaccines are currently licensed and commercialized, and many vaccine candidates are now under preclinical and clinical studies. In recent years, the development of genetically engineered recombinant VLPs has accelerated the need for new, improved downstream processes. In particular, a rapid low cost purification process has been identified as a remaining key challenge in manufacturing process development. In the present study we set up a size-exclusion chromatography-based, scalable purification protocol for the purification of a VLP-based influenza A vaccine produced in Escherichia coli. Recombinant VLPs derived from the RNA bacteriophage MS2 displaying an epitope from the ectodomain of Matrix 2 protein from influenza A virus were produced and purified. The 3 steps purification protocol uses a recently developed multimodal size-exclusion chromatography medium (Capto™ Core 700) in combination with detergent extraction and size-exclusion polishing to reach a 89% VLP purity with a 19% yield. The combination of this downstream strategy following production in E. coli would be suited for production of VLP-based veterinary vaccines targeting livestock and companion animals where large amounts of doses must be produced at an affordable price.

Title: Inactivation of Airborne Bacteria and Viruses Using Extremely Low Concentrations of Chlorine Dioxide Gas.
Abstract: Infectious airborne microbes, including many pathological microbes that cause respiratory infections, are commonly found in medical facilities and constitute a serious threat to human health. Thus, an effective method for reducing the number of microbes floating in the air will aid in the minimization of the incidence of respiratory infectious diseases. Here, we demonstrate that chlorine dioxide (ClO2) gas at extremely low concentrations, which has no detrimental effects on human health, elicits a strong effect to inactivate bacteria and viruses and significantly reduces the number of viable airborne microbes in a hospital operating room. In one set of experiments, a suspension of Staphylococcus aureus, bacteriophage MS2, and bacteriophage ΦX174 were released into an exposure chamber. When ClO2 gas at 0.01 or 0.02 parts per million (ppm, volume/volume) was present in the chamber, the numbers of surviving microbes in the air were markedly reduced after 120 min. The reductions were markedly greater than the natural reductions of the microbes in the chamber. In another experiment, the numbers of viable airborne bacteria in the operating room of a hospital collected over a 24-hour period in the presence or absence of 0.03 ppm ClO2 gas were found to be 10.9 ± 6.7 and 66.8 ± 31.2 colony-forming units/m3 (n = 9, p < 0.001), respectively. Taken together, we conclude that ClO2 gas at extremely low concentrations (≤0.03 ppm) can reduce the number of viable microbes floating in the air in a room. These results strongly support the potential use of ClO2 gas at a non-toxic level to reduce infections caused by the inhalation of pathogenic microbes in nursing homes and medical facilities.

Title: Competitive Coadsorption Dynamics of Viruses and Dissolved Organic Matter to Positively Charged Sorbent Surfaces.
Abstract: Adsorption onto solid-water interfaces is a key process governing the fate and transport of waterborne viruses. Although negatively charged viruses are known to extensively adsorb onto positively charged adsorbent surfaces, virus adsorption in such systems in the presence of negatively charged dissolved organic matter (DOM) as coadsorbate remains poorly studied and understood. This work provides a systematic assessment of the adsorption dynamics of negatively charged viruses (i.e., bacteriophages MS2, fr, GA, and Qβ) and polystyrene nanospheres onto a positively charged model sorbent surface in the presence of varying DOM concentrations. In all systems studied, DOM competitively suppressed the adsorption of the viruses and nanospheres onto the model surface. Electrostatic repulsion of the highly negatively charged MS2, fr, and the nanospheres impaired their adsorption onto DOM adlayers that formed during the coadsorption process. In contrast, the effect of competition on overall adsorption was attenuated for less-negatively charged GA and Qβ because these viruses also adsorbed onto DOM adlayer surfaces. Competition in MS2-DOM coadsorbate systems were accurately described by a random sequential adsorption model that explicitly accounts for the unfolding of adsorbed DOM. Consistent findings for viruses and nanospheres suggest that the coadsorbate effects described herein generally apply to systems containing negatively charged nanoparticles and DOM.

Title: "Nanofiltration" Enabled by Super-Absorbent Polymer Beads for Concentrating Microorganisms in Water Samples.
Abstract: Detection and quantification of pathogens in water is critical for the protection of human health and for drinking water safety and security. When the pathogen concentrations are low, large sample volumes (several liters) are needed to achieve reliable quantitative results. However, most microbial identification methods utilize relatively small sample volumes. As a consequence, a concentration step is often required to detect pathogens in natural waters. Herein, we introduce a novel water sample concentration method based on superabsorbent polymer (SAP) beads. When SAP beads swell with water, small molecules can be sorbed within the beads, but larger particles are excluded and, thus, concentrated in the residual non-sorbed water. To illustrate this approach, millimeter-sized poly(acrylamide-co-itaconic acid) (P(AM-co-IA)) beads are synthesized and successfully applied to concentrate water samples containing two model microorganisms: Escherichia coli and bacteriophage MS2. Experimental results indicate that the size of the water channel within water swollen P(AM-co-IA) hydrogel beads is on the order of several nanometers. The millimeter size coupled with a negative surface charge of the beads are shown to be critical in order to achieve high levels of concentration. This new concentration procedure is very fast, effective, scalable, and low-cost with no need for complex instrumentation.

Title: Concentration of MS2 phage in river water by a combined ferric colloid adsorption and foam separation-based method, with MS2 phage leaching from ferric colloid.
Abstract: The concentration of MS2 phage as a model RNA virus in river water using a combined ferric colloid adsorption and foam separation-based method was examined. The MS2 phage concentrations were determined by the plaque-forming unit (PFU) method and reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis. When ferric colloid adsorption was performed prior to foam separation, MS2 phage was effectively removed from river water and concentrated in the generated foam within 7 min. The removal efficiency was >99% at the optimum iron and casein concentrations of 5 mg-Fe/L and 10 mg/L, respectively. Furthermore, based on the analysis of the collected ferric colloid dissolved using deferoxamine, the MS2 concentration in the colloid-dissolved solution was 190-fold higher than that found in raw water according to RT-qPCR analysis. This is a novel method for concentrating RNA viruses to facilitate their detection in river water using coagulation and foam separation combined with chelate dissolution of ferric flocs.

Title: Electrochemical disinfection of toilet wastewater using wastewater electrolysis cell.
Abstract: The paucity of proper sanitation facilities has contributed to the spread of waterborne diseases in many developing countries. The primary goal of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of using a wastewater electrolysis cell (WEC) for toilet wastewater disinfection. The treated wastewater was designed to reuse for toilet flushing and agricultural irrigation. Laboratory-scale electrochemical (EC) disinfection experiments were performed to investigate the disinfection efficiency of the WEC with four seeded microorganisms (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus, recombinant adenovirus serotype 5, and bacteriophage MS2). In addition, the formation of organic disinfection byproducts (DBPs) trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAA5) at the end of the EC treatment was also investigated. The results showed that at an applied cell voltage of +4 V, the WEC achieved 5-log10 reductions of all four seeded microorganisms in real toilet wastewater within 60 min. In contrast, chemical chlorination (CC) disinfection using hypochlorite [NaClO] was only effective for the inactivation of bacteria. Due to the rapid formation of chloramines, less than 0.5-log10 reduction of MS2 was observed in toilet wastewater even at the highest [NaClO] dosage (36 mg/L, as Cl2) over a 1 h reaction. Experiments using laboratory model waters showed that free reactive chlorine generated in situ during EC disinfection process was the main disinfectant responsible for the inactivation of microorganisms. However, the production of hydroxyl radicals [OH], and other reactive oxygen species by the active bismuth-doped TiO2 anode were negligible under the same electrolytic conditions. The formation of THMs and HAA5 were found to increase with higher applied cell voltage. Based on the energy consumption estimates, the WEC system can be operated using solar energy stored in a DC battery as the sole power source.

Title: Porous silicon membrane-modified electrodes for label-free voltammetric detection of MS2 bacteriophage.
Abstract: A proof of concept for the label-free detection of bacteriophage MS2, a model indicator of microbiological contamination, is validated in this work as a porous silicon (pSi) membrane-based electrochemical biosensor. PSi membranes were used to afford nanochannel architectures. The sensing mechanism was based on the nanochannel blockage caused by MS2 binding to immobilized capture antibodies. This blockage was quantified by measuring the oxidation current of the electroactive species reaching the electrode surface, by means of differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The immunosensor showed a limit of detection of 6 pfu/mL in buffer, allowing the detection of MS2 to levels commonly found in real-world applications, and proved to be unaffected by matrix effects when analyzing MS2 in reservoir water. This platform enables the straightforward, direct and sensitive detection of a broad range of target analytes and constitutes a promising approach towards the development of portable electronic point of sample analysis devices.

Title: Transport and retention of bacteria and viruses in biochar-amended sand.
Abstract: The transport and retention of Escherichia coli and bacteriophages (PRD1, MS2 and ФX174), as surrogates for human pathogenic bacteria and viruses, respectively, were studied in the sand that was amended with several types of biochar produced from various feedstocks. Batch and column studies were conducted to distinguish between the role of attachment and straining in microbe retention during transport. Batch experiments conducted at various solution chemistries showed negligible attachment of viruses and bacteria to biochar before or after chemical activation. At any given solution ionic strength, the attachment of viruses to sand was significantly higher than that of biochar, whereas bacteria showed no attachment to either sand or biochar. Consistent with batch results, biochar addition (10% w/w) to sand reduced virus retention in the column experiments, suggesting a potential negative impact of biochar application to soil on virus removal. In contrast, the retention of bacteria was enhanced in biochar-amended sand columns. However, elimination of the fine fraction (<60μm) of biochar particles in biochar-amended sand columns significantly reduced bacteria retention. Results from batch and column experiments suggest that land application of biochar may only play a role in microbe retention via straining, by alteration of pore size distribution, and not via attachment. Consequently, the particle size distribution of biochar and sediments is a more important factor than type of biochar in determining whether land application of biochar enhances or diminishes microbial retention.

Title: Persistence of F-Specific RNA Coliphages in Surface Waters from a Produce Production Region along the Central Coast of California.
Abstract: F+ RNA coliphages (FRNA) are used to source-track fecal contamination and as surrogates for enteric pathogen persistence in the environment. However, the environmental persistence of FRNA is not clearly understood and necessitates the evaluation of the survival of prototype and environmental isolates of FRNA representing all four genogroups in surface waters from the central coast of California. Water temperature played a significant role in persistence-all prototype and environmental strains survived significantly longer at 10 °C compared to 25 °C. Similarly, the availability of host bacterium was found to be critical in FRNA survival. In the absence of E. coli F(amp), all prototypes of FRNA disappeared rapidly with a D-value (days for one log reduction) of <1.2 d from water samples incubated at 25 °C; the longest surviving prototype was SP. However, in the presence of the host, the order of persistence at 25 °C was QB>MS2>SP>GA and at 10 °C it was QB = MS2>GA>SP. Significant differences in survival were observed between prototypes and environmental isolates of FRNA. While most environmental isolates disappeared rapidly at 25 °C and in the absence of the host, members of genogroups GIII and GI persisted longer with the host compared to members of GII and GIV. Consequentially, FRNA based source tracking methods can be used to detect phages from recent fecal contamination along with those that persist longer in the environment as a result of cooler temperatures and increased host presence.

Title: Cotransport of clay colloids and viruses through water-saturated vertically oriented columns packed with glass beads: Gravity effects.
Abstract: The cotransport of clay colloids and viruses in vertically oriented laboratory columns packed with glass beads was investigated. Bacteriophages MS2 and ΦX174 were used as model viruses, and kaolinite (ΚGa-1b) and montmorillonite (STx-1b) as model clay colloids. A steady flow rate of Q=1.5 mL/min was applied in both vertical up (VU) and vertical down (VD) flow directions. In the presence of KGa-1b, estimated mass recovery values for both viruses were higher for VD than VU flow direction, while in the presence of STx-1b the opposite was observed. However, for all cases examined, the produced mass of viruses attached onto suspended clay particles were higher for VD than VU flow direction, suggesting that the flow direction significantly influences virus attachment onto clays, as well as packed column retention of viruses attached onto suspended clays. KGa-1b hindered the transport of ΦX174 under VD flow, while STx-1b facilitated the transport of ΦX174 under both VU and VD flow directions. Moreover, KGa-1b and STx-1b facilitated the transport of MS2 in most of the cases examined except of the case where KGa-1b was present under VD flow. Also, the experimental data were used for the estimation of virus surface-coverages and virus surface concentrations generated by virus diffusion-limited attachment, as well as virus attachment due to sedimentation. Both sedimentation and diffusion limited virus attachment were higher for VD than VU flow, except the case of MS2 and STx-1b cotransport. The diffusion-limited attachment was higher for MS2 than ΦΧ174 for all cases examined.

Title: Virus removal and integrity in aged RO membranes.
Abstract: Membrane ageing reduces the quality of the filtered water. Therefore, in order to warrant public health, monitoring membrane performances are of utmost importance. Reverse osmosis (RO) membranes are generally used to remove viruses and salt. However, there is no detailed study demonstrating the impact of aged membrane on the rejection of viruses and of membrane integrity indicators. In this paper, the impact of hypochlorite induced RO ageing on the rejection of a virus surrogate (MS2 phage) and four membrane integrity indicators (salt, dissolved organic matter, rhodamine WT and sulphate) was evaluated. Hypochlorite exposure was either active (under filtration) or passive (soaking), and the changes of the membrane surface chemistry were characterised using several autopsy techniques. Under this accelerated ageing condition, the introduction of chlorine in the membrane chemistry and the breakage of amide bonds caused an increase of the water permeability and a decrease of the virus surrogate's and indicators' rejection. Ageing resulted in a more negatively charged membrane and also in a higher hydrophobicity, which lead to the adsorption of MS2 phage. Despite severe physical membrane damage leading to a reduction of salt rejection to 1.2 log (94%), the minimum rejection of MS2 phage stayed on or above 4 log.

Title: Comparison of UV-Induced Inactivation and RNA Damage in MS2 Phage across the Germicidal UV Spectrum.
Abstract: Polychromatic UV irradiation is a common method of pathogen inactivation in the water treatment industry. To improve its disinfection efficacy, more information on the mechanisms of UV inactivation on microorganisms at wavelengths throughout the germicidal UV spectrum, particularly at below 240 nm, is necessary. This work examined UV inactivation of bacteriophage MS2, a common surrogate for enteric pathogens, as a function of wavelength. The bacteriophage was exposed to monochromatic UV irradiation from a tunable laser at wavelengths of between 210 nm and 290 nm. To evaluate the mechanisms of UV inactivation throughout this wavelength range, RT-qPCR (reverse transcription-quantitative PCR) was performed to measure genomic damage for comparison with genomic damage at 253.7 nm. The results indicate that the rates of RNA damage closely mirror the loss of viral infectivity across the germicidal UV spectrum. This demonstrates that genomic damage is the dominant cause of MS2 inactivation from exposure to germicidal UV irradiation.

Title: High-throughput single-molecule screen for small-molecule perturbation of splicing and transcription kinetics.
Abstract: In eukaryotes, mRNA synthesis is catalyzed by RNA polymerase II and involves several distinct steps, including transcript initiation, elongation, cleavage, and transcript release. Splicing of RNA can occur during (co-transcriptional) or after (post-transcriptional) RNA synthesis. Thus, RNA synthesis and processing occurs through the concerted activity of dozens of enzymes, each of which is potentially susceptible to perturbation by small molecules. However, there are few, if any, high-throughput screening strategies for identifying drugs which perturb a specific step in RNA synthesis and processing. Here we have developed a high-throughput fluorescence microscopy approach in single cells to screen for inhibitors of specific enzymatic steps in RNA synthesis and processing. By utilizing the high affinity interaction between bacteriophage capsid proteins (MS2, PP7) and RNA stem loops, we are able to fluorescently label the intron and exon of a β-globin reporter gene in human cells. This approach allows one to measure the kinetics of transcription, splicing and release in both fixed and living cells using a tractable, genetically encoded assay in a stable cell line. We tested this reagent in a targeted screen of molecules that target chromatin readers and writers and identified three compounds that slow transcription elongation without changing transcription initiation.

Title: RNA voyeurism: A coming of age story.
Abstract: Studies of gene expression are typically carried out by a molecular analysis that averages entire populations of cells in culture, or in a tissue. This approach cannot detect cell to cell variability, or collect subcellular information, such as spatial distribution. At the transcriptional level, it is evident that even a robust transcriptional response in ensemble measurements is not uniform among all cells in a population. At the post-transcriptional level, mRNAs and proteins can be trafficked to specific sub-cellular compartments allowing spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression, but these critical spatial relationships are lost with common molecular biology approaches. Through direct visualization of mRNA during the biogenesis process and analyzing the distribution of single mRNA molecules in cells we have gained a deeper understanding of gene expression at many levels. Recent technical advances have made these types of analysis more accessible than ever. The utility of this approach toward studying transcriptional events is underscored throughout many of the articles within this volume. Techniques such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) are being applied to single molecule studies in fixed cells with far-reaching results, but they are limited in their ability to provide information about the dynamic nature of mRNA in vivo, so methodology to visualize single mRNA molecules in living cells has become desirable. In this article, we will discuss the state-of-the-art tagging systems used for real-time imaging of mRNAs that have been developed. We will present an overview of how these approaches have been applied to impacting our view of gene expression.

Title: Viruses at Solid-Water Interfaces: A Systematic Assessment of Interactions Driving Adsorption.
Abstract: Adsorption to solid-water interfaces is a major process governing the fate of waterborne viruses in natural and engineered systems. The relative contributions of different interaction forces to adsorption and their dependence on the physicochemical properties of the viruses remain, however, only poorly understood. Herein, we systematically studied the adsorption of four bacteriophages (MS2, fr, GA, and Qβ) to five model surfaces with varying surface chemistries and to three dissolved organic matter adlayers, as a function of solution pH and ionic strength, using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring. The viruses were selected to have similar sizes and shapes but different surface charges, polarities, and topographies, as identified by modeling the distributions of amino acids in the virus capsids. Virus-sorbent interactions were governed by long-ranged electrostatics and favorable contributions from the hydrophobic effect, and shorter-ranged van der Waals interactions were of secondary importance. Steric effects depended on the topographic irregularities on both the virus and sorbent surfaces. Differences in the adsorption characteristics of the tested viruses were successfully linked to differences in their capsid surface properties. Besides identifying the major interaction forces, this work highlights the potential of computable virus surface charge and polarity descriptors to predict virus adsorption to solid-water interfaces.

Title: A modeling approach to estimate the solar disinfection of viral indicator organisms in waste stabilization ponds and surface waters.
Abstract: Sunlight is known to be a pertinent factor governing the infectivity of waterborne viruses in the environment. Sunlight inactivates viruses via endogenous inactivation (promoted by absorption of solar light in the UVB range by the virus) and exogenous processes (promoted by adsorption of sunlight by external chromophores, which subsequently generate inactivating reactive species). The extent of inactivation is still difficult to predict, as it depends on multiple parameters including virus characteristics, solution composition, season and geographical location. In this work, we adapted a model typically used to estimate the photodegradation of organic pollutants, APEX, to explore the fate of two commonly used surrogates of human viruses (coliphages MS2 and ϕX174) in waste stabilization pond and natural surface water. Based on experimental data obtained in previous work, we modeled virus inactivation as a function of water depth and composition, as well as season and latitude, and we apportioned the contributions of the different inactivation processes to total inactivation. Model results showed that ϕX174 is inactivated more readily than MS2, except at latitudes >60°. ϕX174 inactivation varies greatly with both season (20-fold) and latitude (10-fold between 0 and 60°), and is dominated by endogenous inactivation under all solution conditions considered. In contrast, exogenous processes contribute significantly to MS2 inactivation. Because exogenous inactivation can be promoted by longer wavelengths, which are less affected by changes in season and latitude, MS2 exhibits smaller fluctuations in inactivation throughout the year (10-fold) and across the globe (3-fold between 0 and 60°) compared to ϕX174. While a full model validation is currently not possible due to the lack of sufficient field data, our estimated inactivation rates corresponded well to those reported in field studies. Overall, this study constitutes a step toward estimating microbial water quality as a function of spatio-temporal information and easy-to-determine solution parameters.

Title: Direct Evidence for Packaging Signal-Mediated Assembly of Bacteriophage MS2.
Abstract: Using cross-linking coupled to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry and CLIP-Seq sequencing, we determined the peptide and oligonucleotide sequences at the interfaces between the capsid proteins and the genomic RNA of bacteriophage MS2. The results suggest that the same coat protein (CP)-RNA and maturation protein (MP)-RNA interfaces are used in every viral particle. The portions of the viral RNA in contact with CP subunits span the genome, consistent with a large number of discrete and similar contacts within each particle. Many of these sites match previous predictions of the locations of multiple, dispersed and degenerate RNA sites with cognate CP affinity termed packaging signals (PSs). Chemical RNA footprinting was used to compare the secondary structures of protein-free genomic fragments and the RNA in the virion. Some PSs are partially present in protein-free RNA but others would need to refold from their dominant solution conformations to form the contacts identified in the virion. The RNA-binding peptides within the MP map to two sections of the N-terminal half of the protein. Comparison of MP sequences from related phages suggests a similar arrangement of RNA-binding sites, although these N-terminal regions have only limited sequence conservation. In contrast, the sequences of the C-termini are highly conserved, consistent with them encompassing pilin-binding domains required for initial contact with host cells. These results provide independent and unambiguous support for the assembly of MS2 virions via a PS-mediated mechanism involving a series of induced-fit viral protein interactions with RNA.

Title: Enhanced Inactivation of Escherichia coli and MS2 Coliphage by Cupric Ion in the Presence of Hydroxylamine: Dual Microbicidal Effects.
Abstract: The inactivation of Escherichia coli and MS2 coliphage by Cu(II) is found to be significantly enhanced in the presence of hydroxylamine (HA). The addition of a small amount of HA (i.e., 5-20 μM) increased the inactivation efficacies of E. coli and MS2 coliphage by 5- to 100-fold, depending on the conditions. Dual effects were anticipated to enhance the biocidal activity of Cu(II) by the addition of HA, viz. (i) the accelerated reduction of Cu(II) into Cu(I) (a stronger biocide) and (ii) the production of reactive oxidants from the reaction of Cu(I) with dissolved oxygen (evidenced by the oxidative transformation of methanol into formaldehyde). Deaeration enhanced the inactivation of E. coli but slightly decreased the inactivation efficacy of MS2 coliphage. The addition of 10 μM hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) greatly enhanced the MS2 inactivation, whereas the same concentration of H2O2 did not significantly affect the inactivation efficacy of E. coli Observations collectively indicate that different biocidal actions lead to the inactivation of E. coli and MS2 coliphage. The toxicity of Cu(I) is dominantly responsible for the E. coli inactivation. However, for the MS2 coliphage inactivation, the oxidative damage induced by reactive oxidants is as important as the effect of Cu(I).

Title: Evaluation of an Ultrafiltration-Based Procedure for Simultaneous Recovery of Diverse Microbes in Source Waters.
Abstract: In this study, hollow-fiber ultrafiltration (UF) was assessed for recovery of <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Clostridium perfringens</i> spores, <i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i> oocysts, echovirus 1, and bacteriophages MS2 and ΦX174 from ground and surface waters. Microbes were seeded into twenty-two 50-L water samples that were collected from the Southeastern United States and concentrated to ∼500 mL by UF. Secondary concentration was performed for <i>C. parvum</i> by centrifugation followed by immunomagnetic separation. Secondary concentration for viruses was performed using centrifugal ultrafilters or polyethylene glycol precipitation. Nine water quality parameters were measured in each water sample to determine whether water quality data correlated with UF and secondary concentration recovery efficiencies. Average UF recovery efficiencies were 66%-95% for the six enteric microbes. Average recovery efficiencies for the secondary concentration methods were 35%-95% for <i>C. parvum</i> and the viruses. Overall, measured water quality parameters were not significantly associated with UF recovery efficiencies. However, recovery of ΦX174 was negatively correlated with turbidity. The recovery data demonstrate that UF can be an effective method for concentrating diverse microbes from ground and surface waters. This study highlights the utility of tangential-flow hollow fiber ultrafiltration for recovery of bacteria, viruses, and parasites from large volume environmental water samples.

Title: Solar Disinfection of Viruses in Polyethylene Terephthalate Bottles.
Abstract: Solar disinfection (SODIS) of drinking water in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles is a simple, efficient point-of-use technique for the inactivation of many bacterial pathogens. In contrast, the efficiency of SODIS against viruses is not well known. In this work, we studied the inactivation of bacteriophages (MS2 and ϕX174) and human viruses (echovirus 11 and adenovirus type 2) by SODIS. We conducted experiments in PET bottles exposed to (simulated) sunlight at different temperatures (15, 22, 26, and 40°C) and in water sources of diverse compositions and origins (India and Switzerland). Good inactivation of MS2 (>6-log inactivation after exposure to a total fluence of 1.34 kJ/cm(2)) was achieved in Swiss tap water at 22°C, while less-efficient inactivation was observed in Indian waters and for echovirus (1.5-log inactivation at the same fluence). The DNA viruses studied, ϕX174 and adenovirus, were resistant to SODIS, and the inactivation observed was equivalent to that occurring in the dark. High temperatures enhanced MS2 inactivation substantially; at 40°C, 3-log inactivation was achieved in Swiss tap water after exposure to a fluence of only 0.18 kJ/cm(2). Overall, our findings demonstrate that SODIS may reduce the load of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses, such as echoviruses, particularly at high temperatures and in photoreactive matrices. In contrast, complementary measures may be needed to ensure efficient inactivation during SODIS of DNA viruses resistant to oxidation.

Title: Degradation of Amino Acids and Structure in Model Proteins and Bacteriophage MS2 by Chlorine, Bromine, and Ozone.
Abstract: Proteins are important targets of chemical disinfectants. To improve the understanding of disinfectant-protein reactions, this study characterized the disinfectant:protein molar ratios at which 50% degradation of oxidizable amino acids (i.e., Met, Tyr, Trp, His, Lys) and structure were observed during HOCl, HOBr, and O3 treatment of three well-characterized model proteins and bacteriophage MS2. A critical question is the extent to which the targeting of amino acids is driven by their disinfectant rate constants rather than their geometrical arrangement. Across the model proteins and bacteriophage MS2 (coat protein), differing widely in structure, methionine was preferentially targeted, forming predominantly methionine sulfoxide. This targeting concurs with its high disinfectant rate constants and supports its hypothesized role as a sacrificial antioxidant. Despite higher HOCl and HOBr rate constants with histidine and lysine than for tyrosine, tyrosine generally was degraded in preference to histidine, and to a lesser extent, lysine. These results concur with the prevalence of geometrical motifs featuring histidines or lysines near tyrosines, facilitating histidine and lysine regeneration upon Cl[+1] transfer from their chloramines to tyrosines. Lysine nitrile formation occurred at or above oxidant doses where 3,5-dihalotyrosine products began to degrade. For O3, which lacks a similar oxidant transfer pathway, histidine, tyrosine, and lysine degradation followed their relative O3 rate constants. Except for its low reactivity with lysine, the O3 doses required to degrade amino acids were as low as or lower than for HOCl or HOBr, indicating its oxidative efficiency. Loss of structure did not correlate with loss of particular amino acids, suggesting the need to characterize the oxidation of specific geometric motifs to understand structural degradation.

Title: Attachment and Detachment Behavior of Human Adenovirus and Surrogates in Fine Granular Limestone Aquifer Material.
Abstract: The transport of human adenovirus, nanoparticles, and PRD1 and MS2 bacteriophages was tested in fine granular limestone aquifer material taken from a borehole at a managed aquifer recharge site in Adelaide, South Australia. Comparison of transport and removal of virus surrogates with the pathogenic virus is necessary to understand the differences between the virus and surrogate. Because experiments using pathogenic viruses cannot be done in the field, laboratory tests using flow-through soil columns were used. Results show that PRD1 is the most appropriate surrogate for adenovirus in an aquifer dominated by calcite material but not under high ionic strength or high pH conditions. It was also found that straining due to size and the charge of the colloid were not dominant removal mechanisms in this system. Implications of this study indicate that a certain surrogate may not represent a specific pathogen solely based on similar size, morphology, and/or surface charge. Moreover, if a particular surrogate is representative of a pathogen in one aquifer system, it may not be the most appropriate surrogate in another porous media system. This was apparent in the inferior performance of MS2 as a surrogate, which is commonly used in virus transport studies.

Title: Efficacy of Coral Sand for Removal of and Bacteriophage under Saturated Flow Conditions.
Abstract: Knowledge of how effectively microbes are transported through porous media is useful for water resource/wastewater management. Despite much research having been done to characterize microbial contaminant transport through various sedimentary materials, very little study has been made on coral sand, such as constitutes the primary substrate of many Pacific atolls. We conducted a set of laboratory column experiments as a preliminary examination of how effective coral sand is at attenuating model pathogens J6-2 and MS2 bacteriophage (phage) under saturated flow conditions mildly representative of field conditions at the Bonriki freshwater lens, South Tarawa, Kiribati. The very poorly sorted gravelly sand coral substrate tested proved very effective at attenuating the bacterial tracer, and spatial removal rates of between 0.02 and 0.07 log cm were determined for J6-2. The ability to determine precise removal rates for MS2 phage was compromised by the use of a plastic apparatus, although the evidence weights toward coral sand being less effective at attenuating MS2 phage than it is . Further research is required to fully assess the ability of coral sand to remove pathogens and to explore how this medium could be engineered into cost-effective water/wastewater treatment solutions on Pacific atolls. The phage data from this work highlight the limitations of using plastic apparatus in experiments targeted at characterizing the fate and transport of viruses.

Title: Evaluation of Ag nanoparticle coated air filter against aerosolized virus: Anti-viral efficiency with dust loading.
Abstract: In this study, the effect of dust loading on the anti-viral ability of an anti-viral air filter was investigated. Silver nanoparticles approximately 11 nm in diameter were synthesized via a spark discharge generation system and were used as anti-viral agents coated onto a medium air filter. The pressure drop, filtration efficiency, and anti-viral ability of the filter against aerosolized bacteriophage MS2 virus particles were tested with dust loading. The filtration efficiency and pressure drop increased with dust loading, while the anti-viral ability decreased. Theoretical analysis of anti-viral ability with dust loading was carried out using a mathematical model based on that presented by Joe et al. (J. Hazard. Mater.; 280: 356-363, 2014).

Title: Sunlight inactivation of somatic coliphage in the presence of natural organic matter.
Abstract: Long wavelengths of sunlight spectrum (UVA and visible light), as well as natural organic matter (NOM) are important environmental factors affecting survival of viruses in aquatic environment through direct and indirect inactivation. In order to understand the virus inactivation kinetics under such conditions, this study investigated the effects of Suwannee River natural organic matter (NOM) on the inactivation of a somatic coliphage, phiX174, by UVA and visible light. Experiments were carried out to examine the virucidal effects of UVA/visible light, assess the influence of SRNOM at different concentrations, and identify the effective ROS in virus inactivation. The results from this study showed that the presence of NOM could either enhance virus inactivation or reduce virus inactivation depending on the concentration, where the inactivation rate followed a parabolic relationship against NOM concentration. The results indicated that moderate levels of NOM (11 ppm) had the strongest antiviral activity, while very low or very high NOM concentrations prolonged virus survival. The results also showed that OH▪ was the primary ROS in causing phiX174 (ssDNA virus) inactivation, unlike previous findings where (1)O2 was the primary ROS causing MS2 (ssRNA virus) inactivation. The phiX174 inactivation by OH∙ could be described as k=3.7 ✕ 10(13)[OH∙]+1.404 (R(2)=0.8527).

Title: Aerosolization of a Human Norovirus Surrogate, Bacteriophage MS2, during Simulated Vomiting.
Abstract: Human noroviruses (NoV) are the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide. Epidemiological studies of outbreaks have suggested that vomiting facilitates transmission of human NoV, but there have been no laboratory-based studies characterizing the degree of NoV release during a vomiting event. The purpose of this work was to demonstrate that virus aerosolization occurs in a simulated vomiting event, and to estimate the amount of virus that is released in those aerosols. A simulated vomiting device was constructed at one-quarter scale of the human body following similitude principles. Simulated vomitus matrices at low (6.24 mPa*s) and high (177.5 mPa*s) viscosities were inoculated with low (108 PFU/mL) and high (1010 PFU/mL) concentrations of bacteriophage MS2 and placed in the artificial "stomach" of the device, which was then subjected to scaled physiologically relevant pressures associated with vomiting. Bio aerosols were captured using an SKC Biosampler. In low viscosity artificial vomitus, there were notable differences between recovered aerosolized MS2 as a function of pressure (i.e., greater aerosolization with increased pressure), although this was not always statistically significant. This relationship disappeared when using high viscosity simulated vomitus. The amount of MS2 aerosolized as a percent of total virus "vomited" ranged from 7.2 x 10-5 to 2.67 x 10-2 (which corresponded to a range of 36 to 13,350 PFU total). To our knowledge, this is the first study to document and measure aerosolization of a NoV surrogate in a similitude-based physical model. This has implications for better understanding the transmission dynamics of human NoV and for risk modeling purposes, both of which can help in designing effective infection control measures.

Title: Comparative investigations for adenovirus recognition and quantification: Plastic or natural antibodies?
Abstract: Comparative and comprehensive investigations for adenovirus recognition and detection were conducted using plastic and natural antibodies to compare three different strategies. The implementation of molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) technology for specific and sensitive recognition of viruses with the combination of biosensors was reported. Plastic antibodies (MIPs nanoparticles) were produced for adenovirus by employing a novel solid phase synthesis method. MIP receptors were then characterised using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques prior to immobilisation on a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor as affinity receptor for adenovirus detection. Two different templates were also imprinted as control MIPs (vancomycin-MIP and MS2-MIP). The specific recognition of adenovirus was investigated in the concentration range of 0.01-20 pM and the limit of detection was achieved as 0.02 pM. As an alternative to MIP receptors, direct and sandwich assays were developed for adenovirus quantification using natural antibodies. The detection limit of direct and sandwich assays were found as 0.3 pM and 0.008 pM, respectively. The kinetic data analyses were performed for three different adenovirus recognition methods and cross-reactivity studies were also conducted using MS2 phage as control virus and an excellent specificity was achieved with all assays types. This work confirmed the suitability of the MIPs SPR sensor for the detection of viruses.

Abstract: The objective of this study was to identify sources of fecal contamination in leek and parsley, by using four different F(+)RNA coliphage genogroups (IV, I indicate animal fecal contamination and II, III indicate human fecal contamination). Three different concentrations (10(2), 10(4), 10(6) pfu/ml) of MS2 coliphage were inoculated on the surface of parsley and leek samples for detection of phage recovery efficiency among two methods of elution concentration (PEG-precipitation and Ultracentrifugation) by performing double agar layer (DAL) assay in three replications. Highest recovery of MS2 was observed in PEG method and in 10(6) inoculation concentration. Accordingly, the PEG method was used for washing and isolation of potentially contaminated phages of 30 collected samples (15 samples from the market and 15 samples from the farm). The final solutions of PEG method were tested for the enumeration of plaques by DAL assay. Total RNA was then extracted from recovered phages, and RT-PCR was performed by using four primer sets I, II, III, and IV. Incidence of F(+)RNA coliphages was observed in 12/15 (80 %) and 10/15 (66/6 %) of samples were obtained from farm and market, respectively, using both DAL and RT-PCR test methods. Different genotypes (I, II, and IV) of F(+)RNA coliphages were found in farm samples, while only genotype I was detected in market samples by using the primer sets. Due to the higher frequency of genotype I and IV, the absence of genotype III, and also the low frequency of genotype II, it is concluded that the contamination of vegetable (parsley and leek) in Neyshabour, Iran is most likely originated from animal sources.

Rating: ChatCompletionMessage(content='This abstract discusses a study focused on identifying sources of fecal contamination in leek and parsley using MS2 coliphage as an indicator.

Therefore, the relevance to the goal of using the MS2 phage in phage therapy on multidrug-resistant E. coli is limited.\n\nRating: 3/10', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)

Title: Resistance of Aerosolized Bacterial Viruses to Relative Humidity and Temperature.
Abstract: The use of aerosolized bacteriophages as surrogates for hazardous viruses might simplify and accelerate the discovery of links between viral components and their persistence in the airborne state under diverse environmental conditions. In this study, four structurally distinct lytic phages, MS2 (single-stranded RNA [ssRNA]), ϕ6 (double-stranded RNA [dsRNA]), ϕX174 (single-stranded DNA [ssDNA]), and PR772 (double-stranded DNA [dsDNA]), were nebulized into a rotating chamber and exposed to various levels of relative humidity (RH) and temperature as well as to germicidal UV radiation. The aerosolized viral particles were allowed to remain airborne for up to 14 h before being sampled for analysis by plaque assays and quantitative PCRs. Phages ϕ6 and MS2 were the most resistant at low levels of relative humidity, while ϕX174 was more resistant at 80% RH. Phage ϕ6 lost its infectivity immediately after exposure to 30°C and 80% RH. The infectivity of all tested phages rapidly declined as a function of the exposure time to UVC radiation, phage MS2 being the most resistant. Taken altogether, our data indicate that these aerosolized phages behave differently under various environmental conditions and highlight the necessity of carefully selecting viral simulants in bioaerosol studies.

Rating: ChatCompletionMessage(content='This abstract does not directly address the goal of modifying the MS2 phage lysis protein to not require DNAJ binding for use in phage therapy against multidrug-resistant E. coli.

Title: Impact of virus surface characteristics on removal mechanisms within membrane bioreactors.
Abstract: In this study we investigated the removal of viruses with similar size and shape but with different external surface capsid proteins by a bench-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR). The goal was to determine which virus removal mechanisms (retention by clean backwashed membrane, retention by cake layer, attachment to biomass, and inactivation) were most impacted by differences in the virus surface properties. Seven bench-scale MBR experiments were performed using mixed liquor wastewater sludge that was seeded with three lab-cultured bacteriophages with icosahedral capsids of ∼30 nm diameter (MS2, phiX174, and fr). The operating conditions were designed to simulate those at a reference, full-scale MBR facility. The virus removal mechanism most affected by virus type was attachment to biomass (removals of 0.2 log for MS2, 1.2 log for phiX174, and 3 log for fr). These differences in removal could not be explained by electrostatic interactions, as the three viruses had similar net negative charge when suspended in MBR permeate. Removals by the clean backwashed membrane (less than 1 log) and cake layer (∼0.6 log) were similar for the three viruses. A comparison between the clean membrane removals seen at the bench-scale using a virgin membrane (∼1 log), and the full-scale using 10-year old membranes (∼2-3 logs) suggests that irreversible fouling, accumulated on the membrane over years of operation that cannot be removed by cleaning, also contributes towards virus removal. This study enhances the current mechanistic understanding of virus removal in MBRs and will contribute to more reliable treatment for water reuse applications.

Title: Antimicrobial N-brominated hydantoin and uracil grafted polystyrene beads.
Abstract: Hydantoin-N-halamine derivatives conjugated on polystyrene beads are promising disinfectants with broad antimicrobial activity affected by the gradual release of oxidizing halogen in water. The objective of this work was to identify and test of hydantoin-like molecules possessing urea moiety, which may provide N-haloamines releasing oxidizing halogens when exposed to water at different rates and release profiles for tailored antimicrobial agents. In this work, several hydantoin (five member ring) and for the first time reported, uracil (six member ring) derivatives have been conjugated to polystyrene beads and tested for their lasting antimicrobial activity. Four molecules of each series were conjugated onto polystyrene beads from the reaction of the N-potassium hydantoin or uracil derivatives onto chloromethylated polystyrene beads. A distinct difference in bromine loading capacity and release profiles was found for the different conjugated derivatives. All tested materials exhibit strong antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and bacteriophages MS2 of 7 and ~4 log reduction, respectively. These results highlight the antimicrobial potential of halogenated cyclic molecules containing urea groups as water disinfection agents.

Title: Enteric Viral Surrogate Reduction by Chitosan.
Abstract: Enteric viruses are a major problem in the food industry, especially as human noroviruses are the leading cause of nonbacterial gastroenteritis. Chitosan is known to be effective against some enteric viral surrogates, but more detailed studies are needed to determine the precise application variables. The main objective of this work was to determine the effect of increasing chitosan concentration (0.7-1.5% w/v) on the cultivable enteric viral surrogates, feline calicivirus (FCV-F9), murine norovirus (MNV-1), and bacteriophages (MS2 and phiX174) at 37 °C. Two chitosans (53 and 222 kDa) were dissolved in water (53 kDa) or 1% acetic acid (222 KDa) at 0.7-1.5%, and were then mixed with each virus to obtain a titer of ~5 log plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL. These mixtures were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. Controls included untreated viruses in phosphate-buffered saline and viruses were enumerated by plaque assays. The 53 kDa chitosan at the concentrations tested reduced FCV-F9, MNV-1, MS2, and phi X174 by 2.6-2.9, 0.1-0.4, 2.6-2.8, and 0.7-0.9 log PFU/mL, respectively, while reduction by 222 kDa chitosan was 2.2-2.4, 0.8-1.0, 2.6-5.2, and 0.5-0.8 log PFU/mL, respectively. The 222 kDa chitosan at 1 and 0.7% w/v in acetic acid (pH 4.5) caused the greatest reductions of MS2 by 5.2 logs and 2.6 logs, respectively. Overall, chitosan treatments showed the greatest reduction of MS2, followed by FCV-F9, phi X174, and MNV-1. These two chitosans may contribute to the reduction of enteric viruses at the concentrations tested but would require use of other hurdles to eliminate food borne viruses.

Title: Identification of an Immunogenic Mimic of a Conserved Epitope on the Plasmodium falciparum Blood Stage Antigen AMA1 Using Virus-Like Particle (VLP) Peptide Display.
Abstract: We have developed a peptide display platform based on VLPs of the RNA bacteriophage MS2 that combines the high immunogenicity of VLP display with affinity selection capabilities. Random peptides can be displayed on the VLP surface by genetically inserting sequences into a surface-exposed loop of the viral coat protein. VLP-displayed peptides can then be isolated by selection using antibodies, and the VLP selectants can then be used directly as immunogens. Here, we investigated the ability of this platform to identify mimotopes of a highly conserved conformational epitope present on the Plasmodium falciparum blood-stage protein AMA1. Using 4G2, a monoclonal antibody that binds to this epitope and is a potent inhibitor of erythrocyte invasion, we screened three different VLP-peptide libraries and identified specific VLPs that bound strongly to the selecting mAb. We then tested the ability of a handful of selected VLPs to elicit anti-AMA1 antibody responses in mice. Most of the selected VLPs failed to reliably elicit AMA1 specific antibodies. However, one VLP consistently induced antibodies that cross-reacted with AMA1. Surprisingly, this VLP bound to 4G2 more weakly than the other selectants we identified. Taken together, these data demonstrate that VLP-peptide display can identify immunogenic mimics of a complex conformational epitope and illustrate the promise and challenges of this approach.

Title: Direct ultrafiltration performance and membrane integrity monitoring by microbiological analysis.
Abstract: The feasibility of substituting a conventional pre-treatment, consisting of dioxi-chlorination, coagulation/flocculation, settling and sand filtration, of a drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) by direct ultrafiltration (UF) has been assessed from a microbiological standpoint. Bacterial indicators, viral indicators and human viruses have been monitored in raw river, ultrafiltered and conventionally pre-treated water samples during two years. Direct UF has proven to remove bacterial indicators quite efficiently and to a greater extent than the conventional process does. Nevertheless, the removal of small viruses such as some small bacteriophages and human viruses (e.g. enteroviruses and noroviruses) is lower than the current conventional pre-treatment. Membrane integrity has been assessed during two years by means of tailored tests based on bacteriophages with different properties (MS-2, GA and PDR-1) and bacterial spores (Bacillus spores). Membrane integrity has not been compromised despite the challenging conditions faced by directly treating raw river water. Bacteriophage PDR-1 appears as a suitable microbe to test membrane integrity, as its size is slightly larger than the considered membrane pore size. However, its implementation at full scale plant is still challenging due to difficulties in obtaining enough phages for its seeding.

Title: Enumeration of Somatic and F-RNA Phages as an Indicator of Fecal Contamination in Potable Water from Rural Areas of the North West Province.
Abstract: Bacteriophages are regarded as enteric viral indicators in faecally contaminated water systems and may indicate the presence of human viral pollution. They are relatively resistant to inactivation by natural and treatment processes. In this study, the presence of somatic coliphages and F-RNA coliphages was investigated in potable water from rural areas in the North West province. Water samples were aseptically collected from boreholes and tap water from some rural communities in the North West Province. Physical parameters of the water, such as the temperature, pH and turbidity, were measured before sample collection. Double-agar layer assay was performed using ISO, (1995, 2000) standard methods. Bottled water was used as a negative control and the strains фX174 and MS2 as positive controls. Of the 16 water samples collected, 15 were positive for somatic bacteriophages while F-RNA coliphages were detected in only two samples. Amongst the positive samples 189 and three plaque forming units were obtained for both somatic and F-RNA coliphages, respectively. No coliphage was detected in water from Masamane tap 1. The rest of the samples obtained from various rural areas were positive and did not comply with national and international standards for potable water. This was a cause for concern and should be further investigated.

Title: High performance concentration method for viruses in drinking water.
Abstract: According to the risk assessment of the WHO, highly infectious pathogenic viruses like rotaviruses should not be present in large-volume drinking water samples of up to 90 m(3). On the other hand, quantification methods for viruses are only operable in small volumes, and presently no concentration procedure for processing such large volumes has been reported. Therefore, the aim of this study was to demonstrate a procedure for processing viruses in-line of a drinking water pipeline by ultrafiltration (UF) and consecutive further concentration by monolithic filtration (MF) and centrifugal ultrafiltration (CeUF) of viruses to a final 1-mL sample. For testing this concept, the model virus bacteriophage MS2 was spiked continuously in UF instrumentation. Tap water was processed in volumes between 32.4 m(3) (22 h) and 97.7 m(3) (72 h) continuously either in dead-end (DE) or cross-flow (CF) mode. Best results were found by DE-UF over 22 h. The concentration of MS2 was increased from 4.2×10(4) GU/mL (genomic units per milliliter) to 3.2×10(10) GU/mL and from 71 PFU/mL to 2×10(8) PFU/mL as determined by qRT-PCR and plaque assay, respectively.

Title: The healthy workplace project: Reduced viral exposure in an office setting.
Abstract: Viral illnesses such as gastroenteritis and the common cold create a substantial burden in the workplace due to reduced productivity, increased absenteeism, and increased health care costs. Behaviors in the workplace contribute to the spread of human viruses via direct contact between hands, contaminated surfaces, and the mouth, eyes, and/or nose. This study assessed whether implementation of the Healthy Workplace Project (HWP) (providing hand sanitizers, disinfecting wipes, facial tissues, and use instructions) would reduce viral loads in an office setting of approximately 80 employees after seeding fomites and the hands of volunteer participants with an MS-2 phage tracer. The HWP significantly reduced viable phage detected on participants' hands, communal fomites, and personal fomites (p ≤ .010) in office environments and presents a cost-effective method for reducing the health and economic burden associated with viral illnesses in the workplace.

Title: Use of a Hand Sanitizing Wipe for Reducing Risk of Viral Illness in the Home.
Abstract: This study determined whether a hand sanitizing wipe can reduce virus transmission in households, and could reduce the probability of infection by rhinovirus and rotavirus. Bacteriophage MS-2 (a marker virus) was used to assess viral transmission in five households having at least two children of ages 2-18. Hands of one female adult were inoculated with ~10(8) PFU MS-2 bacteriophages in each home, and after 8 h, hands of all family members and select fomites were sampled to determine baseline contamination without intervention. This sequence was repeated with the intervention, where all family members were instructed to use a quaternary ammonium compound-based sanitizing wipe at least once per day. A significant reduction of virus after the intervention occurred on inoculated hands (95.3%; p = 0.0039), all fomites combined (74.5%; p < 0.005), and non-inoculated hands and fomites combined (73.5%; p < 0.005). However, viral reduction on non-inoculated hands was not significant, likely due to small sample size. Using rhinovirus and rotavirus as models it was estimated that infection risk was reduced by ~30 to 89% with the use of sanitizing wipes once per day depending on the starting concentration of these viruses on hands of susceptible individuals. Therefore, using a hand sanitizing wipe can significantly reduce viral transmission and risk of illness in homes. Previous studies have shown other hand hygiene interventions, such as alcohol-based hand sanitizers, are even more effective for reducing risk of illness in homes; however the sanitizing wipe used in this study is appropriate to use for microbial reduction.

Title: Factors affecting decay of Salmonella Birkenhead and coliphage MS2 during mesophilic anaerobic digestion and air drying of sewage sludge.
Abstract: Factors affecting the decay of Salmonella Birkenhead and coliphage, as representatives of bacterial and viral pathogens, respectively, during mesophilic anaerobic digestion (MAD) and air drying treatment of anaerobically digested sewage sludge were investigated. Controlled concentrations of S. Birkenhead were inoculated into non-sterile, autoclaved, γ-irradiated and nutrient-supplemented sludge and cultures were incubated at 37 °C (MAD sludge treatment temperature) or 20 °C (summer air drying sludge treatment temperature). Nutrient limitation caused by microbial competition was the principal mechanism responsible for the decay of S. Birkenhead by MAD and during air drying of digested sludge. The effects of protease activity in sludge on MS2 coliphage decay in digested and air dried sludge were also investigated. MS2 coliphage showed a 3.0-3.5 log10 reduction during incubation with sludge-protease extracts at 37 °C for 25 h. Proteases produced by indigenous microbes in sludge potentially increase coliphage inactivation and may therefore have a significant role in the decay of enteric viruses in sewage sludge. The results help to explain the loss of viability of enteric bacteria and viral pathogens with treatment process time and contribute to fundamental understanding of the various biotic inactivation mechanisms operating in sludge treatment processes at mesophilic and ambient temperatures.

Title: Preclinical refinements of a broadly protective VLP-based HPV vaccine targeting the minor capsid protein, L2.
Abstract: An ideal prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine would provide broadly protective and long-lasting immune responses against all high-risk HPV types, would be effective after a single dose, and would be formulated in such a manner to allow for long-term storage without the necessity for refrigeration. We have developed candidate HPV vaccines consisting of bacteriophage virus-like particles (VLPs) that display a broadly neutralizing epitope derived from the HPV16 minor capsid protein, L2. Immunization with 16L2 VLPs elicited high titer and broadly cross-reactive and cross-neutralizing antibodies against diverse HPV types. In this study we introduce two refinements for our candidate vaccines, with an eye towards enhancing efficacy and clinical applicability in the developing world. First, we assessed the role of antigen dose and boosting on immunogenicity. Mice immunized with 16L2-MS2 VLPs at doses ranging from 2 to 25 μg with or without alum were highly immunogenic at all doses; alum appeared to have an adjuvant effect at the lowest dose. Although boosting enhanced antibody titers, even a single immunization could elicit strong and long-lasting antibody responses. We also developed a method to enhance vaccine stability. Using a spray dry apparatus and a combination of sugars & an amino acid as protein stabilizers, we generated dry powder vaccine formulations of our L2 VLPs. Spray drying of our L2 VLPs did not affect the integrity or immunogenicity of VLPs upon reconstitution. Spray dried VLPs were stable at room temperature and at 37 °C for over one month and the VLPs were highly immunogenic. Taken together, these enhancements are designed to facilitate implementation of a next-generation VLP-based HPV vaccine which addresses U.S. and global disparities in vaccine affordability and access in rural/remote populations.

Title: A novel method to produce armored double-stranded DNA by encapsulation of MS2 viral capsids.
Abstract: With the rapid development of molecular diagnostic techniques, there is a growing need for quality controls and standards with favorable properties to monitor the entire detection process. In this study, we describe a novel method to produce armored hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA for use in nucleic acid tests, which was confirmed to be stable, homogeneous, noninfectious, nuclease resistant, and safe for shipping. We demonstrated that MS2 bacteriophage could successfully package double-stranded DNA of 1.3-, 3-, 3.5-, and 6.5-kb length into viral capsids with high reassembly efficiency. This is the first application of RNA bacteriophage MS2 as a platform to encapsulate double-stranded DNA, forming virus-like particles (VLPs) which were indistinguishable from native MS2 capsids in size and morphology. Moreover, by analyzing the interaction mechanism of pac site and the MS2 coat protein (CP), we found that in addition to the recognized initiation signal TR-RNA, TR-DNA can also trigger spontaneous reassembly of CP dimers, providing a more convenient and feasible method of assembly. In conclusion, this straightforward and reliable manufacturing approach makes armored DNA an ideal control and standard for use in clinical laboratory tests and diagnostics, possessing prospects for broad application, especially providing a new platform for the production of quality controls for DNA viruses.

Title: Improving the Visible Light Photoactivity of Supported Fullerene Photocatalysts through the Use of [C₇₀] Fullerene.
Abstract: We herein present the first instance of employing [C₇₀] fullerene for photocatalytic ¹O₂ production in water, through covalent immobilization onto a mesoporous silica support via nucelophilic amine addition directly to fullerene's cage. This attachment approach prevents the aggregation of individual fullerene molecules in water, thus allowing fullerene to retain its photoactivity, yet is much less complex than other techniques commonly pursued to create such supported-fullerene materials, which typically rely on water-soluble fullerene derivatives and elaborate immobilization methods. The solid-supported C₇₀ material exhibits significantly improved aqueous visible-light photoactivity compared to previous C₆₀- and C₆₀-derivative-based supported fullerene materials. Further, this material rapidly inactivates MS2 bacteriophage under sunlight illumination, oxidizes various organic contaminants, and does not appear to be significantly fouled by natural organic matter (NOM), highlighting the potential of these materials in real-world applications. Collectively, the ease of preparation and significantly enhanced visible-light photoactivity of these materials advance fullerene-based technologies for water treatment.

Title: Enzymatic Pre-treatment of Wastewater to Minimize Recovery by Reverse Transcriptase PCR of RNA from Inactive Bacteriophages.
Abstract: Quantitative viral risk assessments for wastewaters are notoriously difficult. The often considered quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR reflects poorly on virus infectivity rates leading to inaccurate risk interpretations. Various techniques focused on the degradation of the nucleic acids of non-infective viruses were previously employed. We comparatively assessed the effectiveness of such enzymatic treatments for MS2 bacteriophage in treated wastewaters. The single use of RNase A at an appropriate concentration may be as effective as the combination of RNase followed by Proteinase K and more rapid.

Title: RT-Bst: an integrated approach for reverse transcription and enrichment of cDNA from viral RNA.
Abstract: The synthesis of cDNA from RNA is challenging due to the inefficiency of reverse transcription (RT). In order to address this, an RT-Bst method was developed for sequential RT of RNA and Bst DNA polymerase amplification for enrichment of cDNA in a single-tube reaction. Using genomic RNA from bacteriophage MS2, the yield of cDNA produced by RT alone and RT-Bst were compared by analysis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified products. A superior performance was observed when amplifying MS2 cDNA with random primers following RT-Bst compared to RT alone, indicating greater quantities of cDNA were present after RT-Bst. RT-Bst was also compared with RT alone for their relative ability to produce sufficient cDNA to amplify eight target regions spanning the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) genome. Six out of eight targets were amplified consistently by PCR subsequent to RT-Bst amplification, whereas only three out of eight targets could be amplified after RT alone. The RSV sequences were selectively amplified using RSV-specific primers from a mixed template containing an excess of MS2 RNA without amplifying MS2 sequences. This suggests that RT-Bst can be used to amplify RNA sequences non-specifically using random primers and specifically using sequence-specific primers, and enhances the yield of cDNA when compared to RT alone.

Title: Synonymous modification results in high-fidelity gene expression of repetitive protein and nucleotide sequences.
Abstract: Repetitive nucleotide or amino acid sequences are often engineered into probes and biosensors to achieve functional readouts and robust signal amplification. However, these repeated sequences are notoriously prone to aberrant deletion and degradation, impacting the ability to correctly detect and interpret biological functions. Here, we introduce a facile and generalizable approach to solve this often unappreciated problem by modifying the nucleotide sequences of the target mRNA to make them nonrepetitive but still functional ("synonymous"). We first demonstrated the procedure by designing a cassette of synonymous MS2 RNA motifs and tandem coat proteins for RNA imaging and showed a dramatic improvement in signal and reproducibility in single-RNA detection in live cells. The same approach was extended to enhancing the stability of engineered fluorescent biosensors containing a fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair of fluorescent proteins on which a great majority of systems thus far in the field are based. Using the synonymous modification to FRET biosensors, we achieved correct expression of full-length sensors, eliminating the aberrant truncation products that often were assumed to be due to nonspecific proteolytic cleavages. Importantly, the biological interpretations of the sensor are significantly different when a correct, full-length biosensor is expressed. Thus, we show here a useful and generally applicable method to maintain the integrity of expressed genes, critical for the correct interpretation of probe readouts.

Title: Inactivation of adenovirus, reovirus and bacteriophages in fecal sludge by pH and ammonia.
Abstract: The aim of this study was to evaluate the inactivation of adenovirus, reovirus and bacteriophages (MS2, ΦX174, 28B) in a fecal sludge. We conducted two experiments. In the first, we tested different compositions of the fecal sludge by mixing different amounts of water, feces and urine, totaling nine combinations which were kept at temperatures between 10 and 28°C. In the second study, urea was added to the mixtures, which were kept at temperatures from 5 to 33°C. The inactivation was based on a combination of temperature, pH and uncharged ammonia concentration. The increase in pH and ammonia was provided mainly by urine content (Experiment 1) and by urine and added urea (Experiment 2). The inactivation of bacteriophages was slower than the AdV and ReV. At 23°C and 28°, reasonable treatment times were obtained when pH was higher than 8.9 and NH3 concentrations were higher than 35 and 55 mM respectively. With those conditions, the maximum time for a 3 log reduction in viruses, according to this study, would be 35 days (23°C) and 21 days (28°C). However, in most applications where helminth eggs are present, the treatment time and NH3 for sanitization will be the scaling criteria, as they are more persistent. Concerning the sanitization of effluents from latrines, vacuum toilets or dry toilets in developing countries with tropical and sub-tropical climates, the use of intrinsic ammonia combined with high pH can be effective in producing a safe and highly valuable liquid that can be used as a fertilizer. In the case of the fecal sludge with very intrinsic ammonia concentration (<20 mM), sanitization could still be achieved by the addition of urea.

Title: Removal of Surrogate Bacteriophages and Enteric Viruses from Seeded Environmental Waters Using a Semi-technical Ultrafiltration Unit.
Abstract: Experiments to determine the removal of viruses in different types of water (surface water from two reservoirs for drinking water treatment, treated groundwater and groundwater contaminated with either 5 or 30 % of wastewater) by ultrafiltration were performed with a semi-technical ultrafiltration unit. Concentrations of human adenoviruses (HAdVs), murine norovirus (MNV), and the bacteriophages MS2, ΦX174 and PRD1 were measured in the feed water and the filtrate, and log removal values were calculated. Bacteria added to the feed water were not detected in the filtrates. In contrast, in most cases viruses and bacteriophages were still present in the filtrates: log removal values were in the range of 1.4-6.3 depending on virus sizes and water qualities. Best removals were observed with bacteriophage PRD1 and HAdVs, followed by MNV and phages MS2 and ΦX174. Virus size, however, was not the only criterion for efficient removal. In diluted wastewater as compared to drinking water and uncontaminated environmental waters, virus removal was clearly higher for all viruses, most likely due to higher membrane fouling. For quality assessment purposes of membrane filtration efficiencies with regard to the elimination of human viruses the small bacteriophages MS2 and ΦX174 should be used as conservative viral indicators.

However, the focus on water treatment and membrane filtration may not directly address the modification of the MS2 phage lysis protein to eliminate the need for binding DNAJ. Therefore, while the information presented is informative, it may not directly contribute to the specific research goal of modifying the MS2 phage lysis protein.\n\nRating: 5/10', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)

Title: Microbial removals by a novel biofilter water treatment system.
Abstract: Two point-of-use drinking water treatment systems designed using a carbon filter and foam material as a possible alternative to traditional biosand systems were evaluated for removal of bacteria, protozoa, and viruses. Two configurations were tested: the foam material was positioned vertically around the carbon filter in the sleeve unit or horizontally in the disk unit. The filtration systems were challenged with Cryptosporidium parvum, Raoultella terrigena, and bacteriophages P22 and MS2 before and after biofilm development to determine average log reduction (ALR) for each organism and the role of the biofilm. There was no significant difference in performance between the two designs, and both designs showed significant levels of removal (at least 4 log10 reduction in viruses, 6 log10 for protozoa, and 8 log10 for bacteria). Removal levels meet or exceeded Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards for microbial purifiers. Exploratory test results suggested that mature biofilm formation contributed 1-2 log10 reductions. Future work is recommended to determine field viability.

Title: Attenuation and colloidal mobilization of bacteriophages in natural sediments under anoxic as compared to oxic conditions.
Abstract: Redox conditions are known to affect the fate of viruses in porous media. Several studies report the relevance of colloid-facilitated virus transport in the subsurface, but detailed studies on the effect of anoxic conditions on virus retention in natural sediments are still missing. Therefore, we investigated the fate of viruses in natural flood plain sediments with different sesquioxide contents under anoxic conditions by considering sorption to the solid phase, sorption to mobilized colloids, and inactivation in the aqueous phase. Batch experiments were conducted under oxic and anoxic conditions at pH values between 5.1 and 7.6, using bacteriophages MS2 and PhiX174 as model viruses. In addition to free and colloid-associated bacteriophages, dissolved and colloidal concentrations of Fe, Al and organic C as well as dissolved Ca were determined. Results showed that regardless of redox conditions, bacteriophages did not adsorb to mobilized colloids, even under favourable charge conditions. Under anoxic conditions, attenuation of bacteriophages was dominated by sorption over inactivation, with MS2 showing a higher degree of sorption than PhiX174. Inactivation in water was low under anoxic conditions for both bacteriophages with about one log10 decrease in concentration during 16 h. Increased Fe/Al concentrations and a low organic carbon content of the sediment led to enhanced bacteriophage removal under anoxic conditions. However, even in the presence of sufficient Fe/A-(hydr)oxides on the solid phase, bacteriophage sorption was low. We presume that organic matter may limit the potential retention of sesquioxides in anoxic sediments and should thus be considered for the risk assessment of virus breakthrough in the subsurface.

The microbial inactivation efficiency was studied according to the NSF-231 Guide Standard and Protocol for Testing Microbiological Water Purifiers against Escherichia coli and MS2 phage. The tested resins maintained their activity for 550 L. Thus, N-bromo-dimethylhydantoin-polystyrene beads synthesized under optimized conditions at kilogram quantities have a potential use in water purification filters.

Title: Interaction of human adenoviruses and coliphages with kaolinite and bentonite.
Abstract: Human adenoviruses (hAdVs) are pathogenic viruses responsible for public health problems worldwide. They have also been used as viral indicators in environmental systems. Coliphages (e.g., MS2, ΦX174) have also been studied as indicators of viral pollution in fecally contaminated water. Our objective was to evaluate the distribution of three viral fecal indicators (hAdVs, MS2, and ΦΧ174), between two different phyllosilicate clays (kaolinite and bentonite) and the aqueous phase. A series of static and dynamic experiments were conducted under two different temperatures (4, 25°C) for a time period of seven days. HAdV adsorption was examined in DNase I reaction buffer (pH=7.6, and ionic strength (IS)=1.4mM), whereas coliphage adsorption in phosphate buffered saline solution (pH=7, IS=2mM). Moreover, the effect of IS on hAdV adsorption under static conditions was evaluated. The adsorption of hAdV was assessed by real-time PCR and its infectivity was tested by cultivation methods. The coliphages MS2 and ΦΧ174 were assayed by the double-layer overlay method. The experimental results have shown that coliphage adsorption onto both kaolinite and bentonite was higher for the dynamic than the static experiments; whereas hAdV adsorption was lower under dynamic conditions. The adsorption of hAdV increased with decreasing temperature, contrary to the results obtained for the coliphages. This study examines the combined effect of temperature, agitation, clay type, and IS on hAdV adsorption onto clays. The results provide useful new information on the effective removal of viral fecal indicators (MS2, ΦX174 and hAdV) from dilute aqueous solutions by adsorption onto kaolinite and bentonite. Factors enabling enteric viruses to penetrate soils, groundwater and travel long distances within aquifers are important public health issues. Because the observed adsorption behavior of surrogate coliphages MS2 and ΦΧ174 is substantially different to that of hAdV, neither MS2 nor ΦΧ174 is recommended as a suitable model for adenovirus.

Title: A compact point-of-use water purification cartridge for household use in developing countries.
Abstract: Simple, low-cost household interventions are known to be effective in lowering the incidence of waterborne diseases in developing countries. However, high costs along with operational and maintenance issues have prevented the successful adoption of these interventions among the affected communities. To address these limitations, a cost-effective, gravity-driven water purification cartridge has been developed by employing the synergistic disinfection action of low concentrations of silver and chlorine on bacteria and viruses. The silver and chlorine treatment components within the cartridge have been developed using inexpensive materials and integrated with a life indicator and auto-shut-off-mechanism within a compact form factor. The antibacterial as well as antiviral performance of the cartridge was tested by using ground water spiked with Escherichia coli and MS2 bacteriophage. The results show that, although individually, the silver and chlorine treatment systems were unable to inactivate the test strains, the integrated cartridge inactivates both bacteria as well as viruses up to the log reduction requirement of the USEPA guide standard for microbiological water purifiers over its designated life of 2,000 liters.

Title: Methods for Preparation of MS2 Phage-Like Particles and Their Utilization as Process Control Viruses in RT-PCR and qRT-PCR Detection of RNA Viruses From Food Matrices and Clinical Specimens.
Abstract: RNA viruses are pathogenic agents of many serious infectious diseases affecting humans and animals. The detection of pathogenic RNA viruses is based on modern molecular methods, of which the most widely used methods are the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). All steps of RT-PCR and qRT-PCR should be strictly controlled to ensure the validity of obtained results. False-negative results may be caused not only by inhibition of RT or/and PCR steps but also by failure of the nucleic acid extraction step, particularly in the case of viral RNA extraction. The control of nucleic acid extraction generally involves the utilization of a non-pathogenic virus (process control virus) of similar structural properties to those of the target virus. Although in clinical samples the use of such process control virus is only recommended, in other kinds of settings such as food matrices its use is necessary. Currently, several different process control viruses are used for these purposes. Process control viruses can also be constructed artificially using technology for production of MS2 phage-like particles, which have many advantages in comparison with other used controls and are especially suited for controlling the detection and quantification of certain types of RNA viruses. The technology for production of MS2 phage-like particles is theoretically well established, uses the knowledge gained from the study of the familiar bacteriophage MS2 and utilizes many different approaches for the construction of the various process control viruses. Nevertheless, the practical use of MS2 phage-like particles in routine diagnostics is relatively uncommon. The current situation with regard to the use of MS2 phage-like particles as process control viruses in detection of RNA viruses and different methods of their construction, purification and use are summarized and discussed in this review.

Title: DLVO and XDLVO calculations for bacteriophage MS2 adhesion to iron oxide particles.
Abstract: In this study, batch experiments were performed to examine the adhesion of bacteriophage MS2 to three iron oxide particles (IOP1, IOP2 and IOP3) with different particle properties. The characteristics of MS2 and iron oxides were analyzed using various techniques to construct the classical DLVO and XDLVO potential energy profiles between MS2 and iron oxides. X-ray diffractometry peaks indicated that IOP1 was mainly composed of maghemite (γ-Fe2O3), but also contained some goethite (α-FeOOH). IOP2 was composed of hematite (α-Fe2O3) and IOP3 was composed of iron (Fe), magnetite (Fe3O4) and iron oxide (FeO). Transmission electron microscope images showed that the primary particle size of IOP1 (γ-Fe2O3) was 12.3±4.1nm. IOP2 and IOP3 had primary particle sizes of 167±35nm and 484±192nm, respectively. A surface angle analyzer demonstrated that water contact angles of IOP1, IOP2, IOP3 and MS2 were 44.83, 64.00, 34.33 and 33.00°, respectively. A vibrating sample magnetometer showed that the magnetic saturations of IOP1, IOP2 and IOP3 were 176.87, 17.02 and 946.85kA/m, respectively. Surface potentials measured in artificial ground water (AGW; 0.075mM CaCl2, 0.082mM MgCl2, 0.051mM KCl, and 1.5mM NaHCO3; pH7.6) indicated that iron oxides and MS2 were negatively charged in AGW (IOP1=-0.0185V; IOP2=-0.0194V; IOP3=-0.0301V; MS2=-0.0245V). Batch experiments demonstrated that MS2 adhesion to iron oxides was favorable in the order of IOP1>IOP2>IOP3. This tendency was well predicted by the classical DLVO model. In the DLVO calculations, both the sphere-plate and sphere-sphere geometries predicted the same trend of MS2 adhesion to iron oxides. Additionally, noticeable differences were not found between the DLVO and XDLVO interaction energy profiles, indicating that hydrophobic interactions did not play a major role; electrostatic interactions, however, did influence MS2 adhesion to iron oxides. Furthermore, the aggregation of iron oxides was investigated with a modified XDLVO model. This model included magnetic interactions between the particles in order to predict the aggregation of iron oxides. Even though iron oxide particle aggregation could occur under experimental conditions, the DLVO model results using primary particle size were more suitable for the interactions between MS2 and the iron oxides because of fast sorption of MS2 onto the surfaces of iron oxides.

Title: Electrostatic potential distribution of a soft spherical particle with a charged core and pH-dependent charge density.
Abstract: In this paper we provide numerical results for the electrostatic potential profile of a soft charged particle with a charged core and pH-dependent charge density. The present study serves as a useful platform for better quantification of the electrostatic potential profile of the MS2 bacteriophage virus. In this context, this work improves the analysis of a similar recent study [Phan et al., J. Chem. Phys. 139 (2013) 244908] in two aspects. First, as compared to the previous study, we provide numerical rather than analytical results for the electrostatic potential profile. This is important because the analytical treatment forbids the investigation of cases with intermediate to large charge density, relative to the bulk charge density of the electrolyte, of the viral surface. Second, the consideration of pH-dependent charge density in the electrostatic potential profile is a more credible representation of the electrostatics of the virus, which is known to demonstrate pH-dependent variation in the electrophoretic mobility. In fact, we establish that the various predictions on the electrostatic potential profile made in the previous study are substantially modified when the effect of pH is considered, and the result must now be described in terms of the difference pH-pKa, where Ka refers to the ionization constant of the acid that produces the PEL ions.

Title: Bacteriophage removal in a full-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) - Implications for wastewater reuse.
Abstract: The aim of this study was to assess the potential removal efficacy of viruses in a full-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) wastewater reuse system, using a range of indigenous and 'spiked' bacteriophages (phages) of known size and morphology. Samples were taken each week for three months from nine locations at each treatment stage of the water recycling plant (WRP) and tested for a range of microbiological parameters (n = 135). Mean levels of faecal coliforms were reduced to 0.3 CFU/100 ml in the MBR product and were undetected in samples taken after the chlorination stage. A relatively large reduction (5.3 log) in somatic coliphages was also observed following MBR treatment. However, F-specific and human-specific (GB124) phages were less abundant at all stages, and demonstrated log reductions post-MBR of 3.5 and 3.8, respectively. In 'spiking' experiments, suspended 'spiked' phages (MS2 and B-14) displayed post-MBR log reductions of 2.25 and 2.30, respectively. The removal of these suspended phages, which are smaller than the membrane pore size (0.04 μm), also highlights the possible role of the membrane biofilm as an effective additional barrier to virus transmission. The findings from this study of a full-scale MBR system demonstrate that the enumeration of several phage groups may offer a practical and conservative way of assessing the ability of MBR to remove enteric viruses of human health significance. They also suggest that phage removal in MBR systems may be highly variable and may be closely related on the one hand to both the size and morphology of the viruses and, on the other, to whether or not they are attached to solids.

Title: Quantitative measurement of transcription dynamics in living cells.
Abstract: In a wide range of organisms the kinetics of transcription have been found to be noisy, with "bursts" or "pulses" of transcription interspersed with irregular periods of inactivity. The in vivo analysis of transcription dynamics can be most directly monitored using RNA stem loop motifs derived from MS2 and other bacteriophages. Here we describe the implementation of the MS2 RNA detection system and the steps required for precise measurement of transcription dynamics in highly motile cells. Automated image processing techniques are used to track large numbers of cells and measure transcription in a systematic and unbiased manner.

Based on the result of HRTEM, the single-sheet structure of graphene oxide and the monodisperse Fe3O4 nanoparticles on the surface of graphene can be observed obviously. The G-Fe3O4 composite were attractive for removing a wide range of pathogens including not only bacteriophage ms2, but also various bacteria such as S. aureus, E. coli, Salmonella, E. Faecium, E. faecalis, and Shigella. The removal efficiency of E. coli for G-Fe3O4 composite can achieve 93.09%, whereas it is only 54.97% with pure Fe3O4 nanoparticles. Moreover, a detailed verification test of real water samples was conducted and the removal efficiency of bacteria in real water samples with G-Fe3O4 composite can also reach 94.8%.

Title: Detection of viruses by counting single fluorescent genetically biotinylated reporter immunophage using a lateral flow assay.
Abstract: We demonstrated a lateral flow immunoassay (LFA) for detection of viruses using fluorescently labeled M13 bacteriophage as reporters and single-reporter counting as the readout. AviTag-biotinylated M13 phage were functionalized with antibodies using avidin-biotin conjugation and fluorescently labeled with AlexaFluor 555. Individual phage bound to target viruses (here MS2 as a model) captured on an LFA membrane strip were imaged using epi-fluorescence microscopy. Using automated image processing, we counted the number of bound phage in micrographs as a function of target concentration. The resultant assay was more sensitive than enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and traditional colloidal-gold nanoparticle LFAs for direct detection of viruses.

Title: Size exclusion-based purification and PCR-based quantitation of MS2 bacteriophage particles for environmental applications.
Abstract: MS2 bacteriophage is the most commonly used surrogate for pathogenic viruses in laboratory and field studies. In order to determine the number of infectious viral particles in samples, the use of accurate quantitation methods is essential. We have optimised a size exclusion chromatography-based method for MS2 purification and a SYBR Green-based single-step quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay for the quantitation of MS2. The qRT-PCR enabled accurate quantitation of viral RNA of the purified stock with a detection limit of 2 genome copy equivalents/μl. Detection inhibition, if any, was eliminated by reducing sample volume added to the qRT-PCR reaction mix when MS2 was detected in environmental water samples. The purification method eliminated the impurities and the purified stock yielded a high concentration of infectious MS2 particles. The qRT-PCR assay enabled the accurate quantitation of the viral particles thus providing an alternative to the traditional plaque assays. A combined use of purified MS2 stock and PCR-based quantitation gives the opportunity to explore virus characteristics, behaviour and interactions in the environment.

Title: Action spectra for validation of pathogen disinfection in medium-pressure ultraviolet (UV) systems.
Abstract: Ultraviolet (UV) reactors used for disinfecting water and wastewater must be validated and monitored over time. The validation process requires understanding the photochemical properties of the pathogens of concern and the challenge microorganisms used to represent them. Specifically for polychromatic UV systems, the organisms' dose responses to UV light and their sensitivity across the UV spectrum must be known. This research measured the UV spectral sensitivity, called action spectra, of Cryptosporidium parvum, and MS2, T1UV, Q Beta, T7, and T7m Coliphages, as well as Bacillus pumilus spores. A tunable laser from the National Institute of Standards and Technology was used to isolate single UV wavelengths at 10 nm intervals between 210 and 290 nm. Above 240 nm, all bacteria and viruses tested exhibited a relative peak sensitivity between 260 and 270 nm. Of the coliphage, MS2 exhibited the highest relative sensitivity below 240 nm, relative to its sensitivity at 254 nm, followed by Q Beta, T1UV, T7m and T7 coliphage. B. pumilus spores were more sensitive to UV light at 220 nm than any of the coliphage. These spectra are required for calculating action spectra correction factors for medium pressure UV system validation, for matching appropriate challenge microorganisms to pathogens, and for improving UV dose monitoring. Additionally, understanding the dose response of these organisms at multiple wavelengths can improve polychromatic UV dose calculations and enable prediction of pathogen inactivation from wavelength-specific disinfection technologies such as UV light emitting diodes (LEDs).

Rating: ChatCompletionMessage(content='This research is very relevant to the goal of using the MS2 phage in phage therapy on multidrug-resistant E. coli.

This knowledge can inform the development of targeted disinfection technologies like UV LEDs, further advancing the potential application of phage therapy in combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\n\nRating: 8/10', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)

Title: Ammonia as an in situ sanitizer: inactivation kinetics and mechanisms of the ssRNA virus MS2 by NH3.
Abstract: Sanitizing human and animal waste (e.g., urine, fecal sludge, or grey water) is a critical step in reducing the spread of disease and ensuring microbially safe reuse of waste materials. Viruses are particularly persistent pathogens and can be transmitted through inadequately sanitized waste. However, adequate storage or digestion of waste can strongly reduce the number of viruses due to increases in pH and uncharged aqueous ammonia (NH3), a known biocide. In this study we investigated the kinetics and mechanisms of inactivation of the single-stranded RNA virus MS2 under temperature, pH and NH3 conditions representative of waste storage. MS2 inactivation was mainly controlled by the activity of NH3 over a pH range of 7.0–9.5 and temperatures lower than 40 °C. Other bases (e.g., hydroxide, carbonate) additionally contributed to the observed reduction of infective MS2. The loss in MS2 infectivity could be rationalized by a loss in genome integrity, which was attributed to genome cleavage via alkaline transesterification. The contribution of each base to genome transesterification, and hence inactivation, could be related to the base pKa by means of a Bronsted relationship. The Bronsted relationship in conjunction with the activity of bases in solution enabled an accurate prediction of MS2 inactivation rates.

Title: Virus Sensitivity Index of UV disinfection.
Abstract: A new concept of Virus Sensitivity Index (VSI) is defined as the ratio between the first-order inactivation rate constant of a virus, ki, and that of MS2-phage during UV disinfection, kr. MS2-phage is chosen as the reference virus because it is recommended as a virus indicator during UV reactor design and validation by the US Environmental Protection Agency. VSI has wide applications in research, design, and validation of UV disinfection systems. For example, it can be used to rank the UV disinfection sensitivity of viruses in reference to MS2-phage. There are four major steps in deriving the equation between Hi/Hr and 1/VSI. First, the first-order inactivation rate constants are determined by regression analysis between Log I and fluence required. Second, the inactivation rate constants of MS2-phage are statistically analysed at 3, 4, 5, and 6 Log I levels. Third, different VSI values are obtained from the ki of different viruses dividing by the kr of MS2-phage. Fourth, correlation between Hi/Hr and 1/VSI is analysed by using linear, quadratic, and cubic models. As expected from the theoretical analysis, a linear relationship adequately correlates Hi/Hr and 1/VSI without an intercept. VSI is used to quantitatively predict the UV fluence required for any virus at any log inactivation (Log I). Four equations were developed at 3, 4, 5, and 6 Log I. These equations have been validated using external data which are not used for the virus development. At Log I less than 3, the equation tends to under-predict the required fluence at both low Log I such as 1 and 2 Log I. At Log I greater than 3 Log I, the equation tends to over-predict the fluence required. The reasons for these may very likely be due to the shoulder at the beginning and the tailing at the end of the collimated beam test experiments. At 3 Log I, the error percentage is less than 6%. The VSI is also used to predict inactivation rate constants under two different UV disinfection scenarios such as under sunlight and different virus aggregates. The correlation analysis shows that viruses will be about 40% more sensitive to sunlight than to UV254. On the other hand, virus size of 500 nm will reduce their VSI by 10%. This is the first attempt to use VSI to predict the required fluence at any given Log I. The equation can be used to quantitatively evaluate other parameters influencing UV disinfection. These factors include environmental species, antibiotic-resistant bacteria or genes, photo and dark repair, water quality such as suspended solids, and UV transmittance.

Title: Experimental investigation of virus and clay particles cotransport in partially saturated columns packed with glass beads.
Abstract: Suspended clay particles in groundwater can play a significant role as carriers of viruses, because, depending on the physicochemical conditions, clay particles may facilitate or hinder the mobility of viruses. This experimental study examines the effects of clay colloids on the transport of viruses in variably saturated porous media. All cotransport experiments were conducted in both saturated and partially saturated columns packed with glass beads, using bacteriophages MS2 and ΦX174 as model viruses, and kaolinite (KGa-1b) and montmorillonite (STx-1b) as model clay colloids. The various experimental collision efficiencies were determined using the classical colloid filtration theory. The experimental data indicated that the mass recovery of viruses and clay colloids decreased as the water saturation decreased. Temporal moments of the various breakthrough concentrations collected, suggested that the presence of clays significantly influenced virus transport and irreversible deposition onto glass beads. The mass recovery of both viruses, based on total effluent virus concentrations, was shown to reduce in the presence of suspended clay particles. Furthermore, the transport of suspended virus and clay-virus particles was retarded, compared to the conservative tracer. Under unsaturated conditions both clay particles facilitated the transport of ΦX174, while hindered the transport of MS2. Moreover, the surface properties of viruses, clays and glass beads were employed for the construction of classical DLVO and capillary potential energy profiles, and the results suggested that capillary forces play a significant role on colloid retention. It was estimated that the capillary potential energy of MS2 is lower than that of ΦX174, and the capillary potential energy of KGa-1b is lower than that of STx-1b, assuming that the protrusion distance through the water film is the same for each pair of particles. Moreover, the capillary potential energy is several orders of magnitude greater than the DLVO potential energy.

Title: Programmable RNA shredding by the type III-A CRISPR-Cas system of Streptococcus thermophilus.
Abstract: Immunity against viruses and plasmids provided by CRISPR-Cas systems relies on a ribonucleoprotein effector complex that triggers the degradation of invasive nucleic acids (NA). Effector complexes of type I (Cascade) and II (Cas9-dual RNA) target foreign DNA. Intriguingly, the genetic evidence suggests that the type III-A Csm complex targets DNA, whereas biochemical data show that the type III-B Cmr complex cleaves RNA. Here we aimed to investigate NA specificity and mechanism of CRISPR interference for the Streptococcus thermophilus Csm (III-A) complex (StCsm). When expressed in Escherichia coli, two complexes of different stoichiometry copurified with 40 and 72 nt crRNA species, respectively. Both complexes targeted RNA and generated multiple cuts at 6 nt intervals. The Csm3 protein, present in multiple copies in both Csm complexes, acts as endoribonuclease. In the heterologous E. coli host, StCsm restricts MS2 RNA phage in a Csm3 nuclease-dependent manner. Thus, our results demonstrate that the type III-A StCsm complex guided by crRNA targets RNA and not DNA.

Title: Adsorption of MS2 on oxide nanoparticles affects chlorine disinfection and solar inactivation.
Abstract: Adsorption on colloidal particles is one of the environmental processes affecting fate, transport, viability or reproducibility of viruses. This work studied colloidal interactions (adsorption kinetics and isotherms) between different oxide nanoparticles (NPs) (i.e., TiO2, NiO, ZnO, SiO2, and Al2O3) and bacteriophage, MS2. The results shows that that all oxide NPs exhibited strong adsorption capacity for MS2, except SiO2 NPs, which is supported by the extended Derjaguin and Landau, Verwey and Overbeek (EDLVO) theory. Moreover, the implication of such colloidal interactions on water disinfection is manifested by the observations that the presence of TiO2 and ZnO NPs could enhance MS2 inactivation under solar irradiation, whereas NiO and SiO2 decreased MS2 inactivation. By contrast, all of these oxide NPs were found to mitigate chlorine disinfection against MS2 to different extent, and the shielding effect was probably caused by reduced free chlorine and free MS2 in the solution due to sorption onto NPs. Clearly, there is a pressing need to further understand colloidal interactions between engineered NPs and viruses in water to better improve the current water treatment processes and to develop novel nanomaterials for water disinfection.

Title: Conceptual model and experimental framework to determine the contributions of direct and indirect photoreactions to the solar disinfection of MS2, phiX174, and adenovirus.
Abstract: Sunlight inactivates waterborne viruses via direct (absorption of sunlight by the virus) and indirect processes (adsorption of sunlight by external chromophores, which subsequently generate reactive species). While the mechanisms underlying these processes are understood, their relative importance remains unclear. This study establishes an experimental framework to determine the kinetic parameters associated with a virus' susceptibility to solar disinfection and proposes a model to estimate disinfection rates and to apportion the contributions of different inactivation processes. Quantum yields of direct inactivation were determined for three viruses (MS2, phiX174, and adenovirus), and second-order rate constants associated with indirect inactivation by four reactive species ((1)O2, OH(•), CO3(•-), and triplet states) were established. PhiX174 exhibited the greatest quantum yield (1.4 × 10(-2)), indicating that it is more susceptible to direct inactivation than MS2 (2.9 × 10(-3)) or adenovirus (2.5 × 10(-4)). Second-order rate constants ranged from 1.7 × 10(7) to 7.0 × 10(9) M(-1) s(-1) and followed the sequence MS2 > adenovirus > phiX174. A predictive model based on these parameters accurately estimated solar disinfection of MS2 and phiX174 in a natural water sample and approximated that of adenovirus within a factor of 6. Inactivation mostly occurred by direct processes, though indirect inactivation by (1)O2 also contributed to the disinfection of MS2 and adenovirus.

Title: MS2 virus inactivation by atmospheric-pressure cold plasma using different gas carriers and power levels.
Abstract: In this study, airborne MS2 bacteriophages were exposed for subsecond time intervals to atmospheric-pressure cold plasma (APCP) produced using different power levels (20, 24, and 28 W) and gas carriers (ambient air, Ar-O2 [2%, vol/vol], and He-O2 [2%, vol/vol]). In addition, waterborne MS2 viruses were directly subjected to the APCP treatment for up to 3 min. MS2 viruses with and without the APCP exposure were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Viral inactivation was shown to exhibit linear relationships with the APCP generation power and exposure time (R(2) > 0.95 for all energy levels tested) up to 95% inactivation (1.3-log reduction) after a subsecond airborne exposure at 28 W; about the same inactivation level was achieved for waterborne viruses with an exposure time of less than 1 min. A larger amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as atomic oxygen, in APCP was detected for a higher generation power with Ar-O2 and He-O2 gas carriers. SEM images, SDS-PAGE, and agarose gel analysis of exposed waterborne viruses showed various levels of damage to both surface proteins and their related RNA genes after the APCP exposure, thus leading to the loss of their viability and infectivity.

Title: Relative insignificance of virus inactivation during aluminum electrocoagulation of saline waters.
Abstract: Combined removal and inactivation of the MS2 bacteriophage from model saline (0-100 mM NaCl) waters by electrochemical treatment using a sacrificial aluminum anode was evaluated. Both chemical and electrodissolution contributed to coagulant dosing since measured aluminum concentrations were statistically higher than purely electrochemical predictions using Faraday's law. Electrocoagulation generated only small amounts of free chlorine in situ but effectively destabilized viruses and incorporated them into Al(OH)3(s) flocs during electrolysis. Low chlorine concentrations combined with virus shielding and aggregation within flocs resulted in very slow disinfection rates necessitating extended flocculation/contact times to achieve significant log-inactivation. Therefore, the dominant virus control mechanism during aluminum electrocoagulation of saline waters is "physical" removal by uptake onto flocs rather than "chemical" inactivation by chlorine. Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy provided evidence for oxidative transformations of capsid proteins including formation of oxyacids, aldehydes, and ketones. Electrocoagulation significantly altered protein secondary structures decreasing peak areas associated with turns, bends, α-helices, β-structures, and random coils for inactivated viruses compared with the MS2 stock. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) measurements showed rapid initial RNA damage following a similar trend as plaque assay measurements of infectious viruses. However, ssRNA cleavage measured by qRT-PCR underestimated inactivation over longer durations. Although aluminum electrocoagulation of saline waters disorders virus capsids and damages RNA, inactivation occurs at a sufficiently low rate so as to only play a secondary role to floc-encapsulation during residence times typical of electrochemical treatment.

Rating: ChatCompletionMessage(content='This abstract discusses the use of electrochemical treatment with a sacrificial aluminum anode to remove and inactivate the MS2 bacteriophage from saline water solutions.

Title: Assessment of coliphage surrogates for testing drinking water treatment devices.
Abstract: Test protocols have been developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to test water treatment devices/systems that are used at the individual and home levels to ensure the removal of waterborne viruses. The goal of this study was to assess if coliphage surrogates could be used in this testing in place of the currently required use of animal or human enteric viruses. Five different coliphages (MS-2, PRD1, ΦX-174, Qβ, and fr) were compared to the removal of poliovirus type 1 (LSc-2ab) by eight different water treatment devices/systems using a general case and a challenge case (high organic load, dissolved solids, and turbidity) test water as defined by the USEPA. The performance of the units was rated as a pass/fail based on a 4 log removal/inactivation of the viruses. In all cases, a failure or a pass of the units/system for poliovirus also corresponded to a pass/fail by all of the coliphages. In summary, in using pass/fail criteria as recommended under USEPA guidelines for testing water treatment device/systems, the use of coliphages should be considered as an alternative to reduce cost and time of testing such devices/systems.

Title: Aerosolization of respirable droplets from a domestic spa pool and the use of MS-2 coliphage and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as markers for Legionella pneumophila.
Abstract: Legionnaires' disease can result when droplets or aerosols containing legionella bacteria are inhaled and deposited in the lungs. A number of outbreaks have been associated with the use of a spa pool where aeration, a high water temperature, and a large and variable organic load make disinfectant levels difficult to maintain. Spa pool ownership is increasing, and the aim of this study, using two surrogate organisms (MS-2 coliphage and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [a natural contaminant]), was to assess the potential risk to domestic users when disinfection fails. A representative "entry level" domestic spa pool was installed in an outdoor courtyard. The manufacturer's instructions for spa pool maintenance were not followed. A cyclone sampler was used to sample the aerosols released from the spa pool with and without activation of the air injection system. Samples were taken at increasing heights and distances from the pool. An aerodynamic particle sizer was used to measure the water droplet size distribution at each sample point. When the air injection system was inactivated, neither surrogate organism was recovered from the air. On activation of the air injection system, the mean mass of droplets within the respirable range (10 cm above the water line) was 36.8 μg cm(-3). This corresponded to a mean air concentration of P. aeruginosa of 350 CFU m(-3). From extrapolation from animal data, the estimated risk of infection from aerosols contaminated with similar concentrations of Legionella pneumophila was 0.76 (males) and 0.65 (females). At 1 m above and/or beyond the pool, the mean aerosol mass decreased to 0.04 μg cm(-3) and corresponded to a 100-fold reduction in mean microbial air concentration. The estimated risk of infection at this distance was negligible.

Title: Adsorption of Rotavirus, MS2 Bacteriophage and Surface-Modified Silica Nanoparticles to Hydrophobic Matter.
Abstract: Adsorption to aquifer media is an important process in the removal of viruses from groundwater. Even though hydrophobic interactions have been shown to contribute to adsorption, little is known about the hydrophobicity of viruses found in groundwater. In this study, the hydrophobicity of rotavirus, MS2 bacteriophage and DNA-labelled silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) coated with glycoprotein, protein A and alpha-1-microglobulin/bikunin precursor (AMBP) was investigated. The hydrophobicity was experimentally determined by using a modified microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons (MATH) assay. The results were compared with the theoretical hydrophobicity of the viral capsid proteins and the proteins used to coat the nanoparticles, and with the results of adsorption tests with unmodified and organosilane-coated (hydrophobic) silica sand. While most theoretical protein hydrophobicity values were similar, the results of the MATH assay suggested fundamental differences in the hydrophobicity of the viruses and the SiNPs. MS2 was found to be highly hydrophobic as based on the MATH hydrophobicity and a significantly enhanced adsorption to hydrophobic sand, whereas rotavirus was relatively hydrophilic. The MATH assay revealed that protein-coating of SiNP introduced some degree of hydrophobicity to hydrophilic SiNPs, enabling them to more closely mimic viral hydrophobicity. Our study also demonstrated that the protein-coated SiNPs better mimicked rotavirus adsorption to sand media (coated or not coated with hydrophobic organic matter) than the MS2. This further supports previous findings that these surface-modified SiNPs are useful surrogates in mimicking rotavirus retention and transport in porous media.

Title: [Effects of algae and kaolinite particles on the survival of bacteriophage MS2].
Abstract: In this study, Bacteriophage MS2, Kaolinite and Microcystis aeruginosa were selected as model materials for human enteric viruses, inorganic and organic particles, respectively. The influence of the inorganic (Kaolinite) or organic (Microcystis aeruginosa) particles on the survival of MS2 at different conditions, such as particles concentration, pH, ion concentration and natural organic matter (NOM) were studied. The results showed that Kaolinite had no effect on the survival of phage MS2 except that apparent survival of MS2 increased 1 logarithm in higher hardness water. Microcystis aeruginosa addition reduced 1 logarithm of MS2 survival. However, when the pH value was greater than 4.0 or the concentration of Microcystis aeruginosa was less than 1.0 x 10(6) cells x L(-1), Microcystis aeruginosa addition had no influence on the survival of MS2. In higher hardness water, Microcystis aeruginosa protected MS2 viruses and then increased the survival of MS2. In drinking water, resource containing higher concentration of particles, the survival ability of virus would be enhanced with the increase of the hardness and then elevated the risks of drinking water safety.

Title: Tailored carbon nanotube immunosensors for the detection of microbial contamination.
Abstract: The use of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as building blocks in the design of electrochemical biosensors has been attracting attention over the last few years, mainly due to their high electrical conductivity and large surface area. Here, we present two approaches based on tailored single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) architectures to develop immunosensors for the bacteriophage MS2, a virus often detected in sewage-impacted water supplies. In the first approach, SWCNTs were used in the bottom-up design of sensors as antibody immobilization support. Carboxy-functionalised SWCNTs were covalently tethered onto gold electrodes via carbodiimide coupling to cysteamine-modified gold electrodes. These SWCNTs were hydrazide functionalized by electrochemical grafting of diazonium salts. Site-oriented immobilization of antibodies was then carried out through hydrazone bond formation. Results showed microarray electrode behavior, greatly improving the signal-to-noise ratio. Excellent sensitivity and limit of detection (9.3 pfu/mL and 9.8 pfu/mL in buffer and in river water, respectively) were achieved, due to the combination of the SWCNTs' ability to promote electron transfer reactions with electroactive species at low overpotentials and their high surface-to-volume ratio providing a favorable environment to immobilize biomolecules. In the second approach, SWCNTs were decorated with iron oxide nanoparticles. Diazonium salts were electrochemically grafted on iron-oxide-nanoparticle-decorated SWCNTs to functionalize them with hydrazide groups that facilitate site-directed immobilization of antibodies via hydrazone coupling. These magnetic immunocarriers facilitated MS2 separation and concentration on an electrode surface. This approach minimized non-specific adsorptions and matrix effects and allowed low limits of detection (12 pfu/mL and 39 pfu/mL in buffer and in river water, respectively) that could be further decreased by incubating the magnetic immunocarriers with larger volumes of sample. Significantly, both approaches permitted the detection of MS2 to levels regularly encountered in sewage-impacted environments.

Title: In vivo RNA labeling using MS2.
Abstract: The trafficking and asymmetric distribution of cytoplasmic RNA is a fundamental process during development and signaling across phyla. Plants support the intercellular trafficking of RNA molecules such as gene transcripts, small RNAs, and viral RNA genomes by targeting these RNA molecules to plasmodesmata (PD). Intercellular transport of RNA molecules through PD has fundamental implications in the cell-to-cell and systemic signaling during plant development and in the systemic spread of viral disease. Recent advances in time-lapse microscopy allow researchers to approach dynamic biological processes at the molecular level in living cells and tissues. These advances include the ability to label RNA molecules in vivo and thus to monitor their distribution and trafficking. In a broadly used RNA labeling approach, the MS2 method, the RNA of interest is tagged with a specific stem-loop (SL) RNA sequence derived from the origin of assembly region of the bacteriophage MS2 genome that binds to the bacteriophage coat protein (CP) and which, if fused to a fluorescent protein, allows the visualization of the tagged RNA by fluorescence microscopy. Here we describe a protocol for the in vivo visualization of transiently expressed SL-tagged RNA and discuss key aspects to study RNA localization and trafficking to and through plasmodesmata in Nicotiana benthamiana plants.

Title: Isoelectric point is an inadequate descriptor of MS2, Phi X 174 and PRD1 phages adhesion on abiotic surfaces.
Abstract: MS2, Phi X 174 and PRD1 bacteriophages are commonly used as surrogates to evaluate pathogenic virus behavior in natural aquatic media. The interfacial properties of these model soft bioparticles are herein discussed in connection with their propensities to adhere onto abiotic surfaces that differ in terms of surface charges and hydrophobicities. The phages considered in this work exhibit distinct multilayered surface structures and their electrostatic charges are evaluated from the dependence of their electrophoretic mobilities on electrolyte concentration at neutral pH on the basis of electrokinetic theory for soft (bio)particles. The charges of the viruses probed by electrokinetics vary according to the sequence Phi X 174⩽PRD1≪MS2, where '<' stands for 'less charged than'. The hydrophobic/hydrophilic balances of the phages are further derived from their adhesions onto model hydrophobic and hydrophilic self-assembled mono-layers. The corresponding results lead to the following hydrophobicity sequence Phi X 174≪MS2<PRD1 where '<' means 'less hydrophobic than'. The respective electrostatic and hydrophobic/hydrophilic features of the phages are further shown to be consistent with their measured adhesions onto polyethersulfone-based membranes with distinct hydrophobicities and charge levels. The methodology clearly demonstrates that the traditionally adopted phage isoelectric point as a relevant physicochemical descriptor for phage adhesion is not adequate for MS2, Phi X 174 and PRD1 bacteriophages.

Title: Affinity purification of long noncoding RNA-protein complexes from formaldehyde cross-linked mammalian cells.
Abstract: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of recently identified untranslated RNA molecules that have been shown to function in diverse cellular processes. The purification and analysis of lncRNA-protein (lncRNP) complexes is critical toward understanding the normal physiological function of these molecules. Here, we describe the purification of lncRNP complexes from human cells using a FLAG-tagged MS2-phage coat protein (MS2 CP) that binds in sequence-specific fashion to MS2-phage coat protein-binding sites (MS2bs) with high affinity. In these experiments, a FLAG-tagged MS2 CP is transiently co-expressed with a version of the lncRNA into which 12 copies of the MS2bs have been inserted near its 3'-end. The lncRNA-FLAG-tagged MS2 CP complex is then isolated using an anti-FLAG antibody, allowing for characterization of associated cellular proteins and RNAs.

Title: Electrical immunosensor based on dielectrophoretically-deposited carbon nanotubes for detection of influenza virus H1N1.
Abstract: The influenza virus has received extensive attention due to the recent H1N1 pandemics originating from swine. This study reports a label-free, highly sensitive, and selective electrical immunosensor for the detection of influenza virus H1N1 based on dielectrophoretically deposited single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). COOH-functionalized SWCNTs were deposited on a self-assembled monolayer of polyelectrolyte polydiallyldimethyl-ammonium chloride (PDDA) between two gold electrodes by dielectrophoretic and electrostatic forces, which resulted in reproducible, uniform, aligned, and aggregation-free SWCNT channels (2-10 μm in length). Avidin was immobilized onto the PDDA-SWCNT channels, and viral antibodies were immobilized using biotin-avidin coupling. The resistance of the channels increased with the binding of the influenza viruses to the antibodies. These immunosensors showed linear behavior as the virus concentration was varied from 1 to 10(4) PFU ml(-1) along with a detection time of 30 min. The immunosensors with a 2 μm channel length detected 1 PFU ml(-1) of the influenza virus accurately (R(2) = 0.99) and selectively from MS2 bacteriophages. These immunosensors have the potential to become an important component of a point-of-care test kit that will enable a rapid clinical diagnosis.

Title: Optical fluence modelling for ultraviolet light emitting diode-based water treatment systems.
Abstract: This work presents a validated optical fluence rate model optimised for ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (UV-LEDs), which allow a very wide range of emission wavelengths and source geometries to be used in water treatment units. The model is based on a Monte Carlo approach, in which an incremental ray-tracing algorithm is used to calculate the local volumetric rate of energy absorption and subsequently convert it to the local fluence rate distribution for an UV-LED water treatment chamber of arbitrary design. The model includes contributions from optical reflections and scattering by treatment chamber walls and from scattering due to particulates and/or microorganisms. The model successfully predicts optical fluence rates in point-of-use water treatment units, as verified using biodosimetry with MS-2 bacteriophage at a UV-LED emission wavelength of 254 nm. The effects of chamber geometry are also modelled effectively and are consistent with the inactivation data for E. coli at 254 nm. The data indicate that this model is suitable for application in the design and optimisation of UV-LED-based water treatment systems.

Title: Fabrication of an anti-viral air filter with SiO₂-Ag nanoparticles and performance evaluation in a continuous airflow condition.
Abstract: In this study, SiO2 nanoparticles surface coated with Ag nanoparticles (SA particles) were fabricated to coat a medium air filter. The pressure drop, filtration efficiency, and anti-viral ability of the filter were evaluated against aerosolized bacteriophage MS2 in a continuous air flow condition. A mathematical approach was developed to measure the anti-viral ability of the filter with various virus deposition times. Moreover, two quality factors based on the anti-viral ability of the filter, and a traditional quality factor based on filtration efficiency, were calculated. The filtration efficiency and pressure drop increased with decreasing media velocity and with increasing SA particle coating level. The anti-viral efficiency also increased with increasing SA particle coating level, and decreased by with increasing virus deposition time. Consequently, SA particle coating on a filter does not have significant effects on filtration quality, and there is an optimal coating level to produce the highest anti-viral quality.

Title: Building polyhedra by self-assembly: theory and experiment.
Abstract: We investigate the utility of a mathematical framework based on discrete geometry to model biological and synthetic self-assembly. Our primary biological example is the self-assembly of icosahedral viruses; our synthetic example is surface-tension-driven self-folding polyhedra. In both instances, the process of self-assembly is modeled by decomposing the polyhedron into a set of partially formed intermediate states. The set of all intermediates is called the configuration space, pathways of assembly are modeled as paths in the configuration space, and the kinetics and yield of assembly are modeled by rate equations, Markov chains, or cost functions on the configuration space. We review an interesting interplay between biological function and mathematical structure in viruses in light of this framework. We discuss in particular: (i) tiling theory as a coarse-grained description of all-atom models; (ii) the building game-a growth model for the formation of polyhedra; and (iii) the application of these models to the self-assembly of the bacteriophage MS2. We then use a similar framework to model self-folding polyhedra. We use a discrete folding algorithm to compute a configuration space that idealizes surface-tension-driven self-folding and analyze pathways of assembly and dominant intermediates. These computations are then compared with experimental observations of a self-folding dodecahedron with side 300 μm. In both models, despite a combinatorial explosion in the size of the configuration space, a few pathways and intermediates dominate self-assembly. For self-folding polyhedra, the dominant intermediates have fewer degrees of freedom than comparable intermediates, and are thus more rigid. The concentration of assembly pathways on a few intermediates with distinguished geometric properties is biologically and physically important, and suggests deeper mathematical structure.

Title: MS2 phage ribonucleoproteins as exogenous internal control for RT-qPCR data normalization in gene expression study of developing rat brain.
Abstract: The most popular strategy for normalization of RT-qPCR data involves presenting them in comparison with expression of "housekeeping" genes. However, the required stable expression of the control genes is not always achievable. As an alternative, we used ribonucleoprotein phage particles as an exogenous internal control and demonstrated that this type of normalization provides a simple and reliable method for quantification in RT-qPCR experiments. Using phage-based normalization, we analyzed mRNA levels of three popular housekeeping genes coding β-actin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and ribosomal protein L30 and showed high variability in their expression patterns during rat brain development, indicating that they should not be used as controls in gene expression studies of the developing brain either individually or in combination. Using phage-based controls, we showed interstrain differences and age-related changes in the expression of genes involved in proteoglycan biosynthesis and degradation in developing brain of senescence-accelerated OXYS rats and control Wistar rats.

Title: Development of a versatile and stable internal control system for RT-qPCR assays.
Abstract: RT-qPCR, an established method for the detection of RNA viruses, requires internal RNA controls for the correct interpretation of PCR results. Robust and versatile RT-PCR controls can be achieved for example by packaging RNA into a virus-derived protein shell. In this study a MS2-based internal control system was developed, that allows stable and universal packing of different RNAs into non-infectious, non-lytic MS2-based viral like particles (VLPs). Two competitive internal controls for a hantavirus assay and a Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus (CCHFV) assay were cloned for the expression of VLPs. The expression of VLPs containing the RNA of interest could be induced with arabinose in Escherichia coli. The VLPs proved to be temperature resistant and could be frozen and thawed several times without degradation. Distinction of IC RNA from the target RNA was facilitated by a clear shift in the melting temperature or by specific hybridization signals. Furthermore, target and IC PCR amplification could be easily distinguished by their size in gel-electrophoretic analyses. Limits of detection were determined, demonstrating that the application of the IC did not reduce the sensitivity of the target RT-qPCR reactions. The system can be adapted to nearly any required sequence, resulting in a highly flexible method with broad range applications.

Title: Chemical constitution and effect of extracts of tomato plants byproducts on the enteric viral surrogates.
Abstract: Byproducts of tomato are known to include phenolic compounds but have not been studied in depth. In this study, the phenolic compositions of (stem, leaf, root, and whole plant) of two tomato cultivars, Pitenza and Floradade, were analyzed by HPLC-DAD. In parallel, the antiviral effects of crude extracts on viral surrogates, the bacteriophages MS2 and Av-05 were evaluated. The leaf extracts from the two varieties showed the highest concentration of phenolic compounds. The compounds identified were gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, ferulic acid, cafeic acid, rutin, and quercetin, and they represented 3174.3 and 1057.9 mg/100 g dried weight of the Pitenza and Floradade cultivars, respectively. MS2 and Av-05 titers at 5 mg/mL were reduced by 3.47 and 5.78 log10 PFU/mL and 3.78 and 4.93 log10 PFU/mL by Pitenza and Floradade cultivar leaf extract, respectively.

Title: Transport and removal of viruses in saturated sand columns under oxic and anoxic conditions--Potential implications for groundwater protection.
Abstract: To protect groundwater as a drinking water resource from microbiological contamination, protection zones are installed. While travelling through these zones, concentrations of potential pathogens should decline to levels that pose no risks to human health. Removal of viruses during subsurface passage is influenced by physicochemical conditions, such as oxygen concentration, which also affects virus survival. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of redox conditions on the removal of viruses during sand filtration. Experiments in glass columns filled with medium-grained sand were conducted to investigate virus removal in the presence and absence of dissolved oxygen. Bacteriophages MS2 and PhiX174, as surrogates for human enteric viruses were spiked in pulsed or in continuous mode and pumped through the columns at a filter velocity of about 1m/d. Virus breakthrough curves were analyzed by calculating total viral elimination and fitted using one-dimensional transport models (CXTFIT and HYDRUS-1D). While short-term experiments with pulsed virus application showed only small differences with regard to virus removal under oxic and anoxic conditions, a long-term experiment with continuous dosing revealed a clearly lower elimination of viruses under anoxic conditions. These findings suggest that less inactivation and less adsorption of viruses in anoxic environments affect their removal. Therefore, in risk assessment studies aimed to secure drinking water resources from viral contamination and optimization of protection zones, the oxic and anoxic conditions in the subsurface should also be considered.

Title: Hierarchical assembly of plasmonic nanostructures using virus capsid scaffolds on DNA origami templates.
Abstract: Building plasmonic nanostructures using biomolecules as scaffolds has shown great potential for attaining tunable light absorption and emission via precise spatial organization of optical species and antennae. Here we report bottom-up assembly of hierarchical plasmonic nanostructures using DNA origami templates and MS2 virus capsids. These serve as programmable scaffolds that provide molecular level control over the distribution of fluorophores and nanometer-scale control over their distance from a gold nanoparticle antenna. While previous research using DNA origami to assemble plasmonic nanostructures focused on determining the distance-dependent response of single fluorophores, here we address the challenge of constructing hybrid nanostructures that present an organized ensemble of fluorophores and then investigate the plasmonic response. By combining finite-difference time-domain numerical simulations with atomic force microscopy and correlated scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy, we find that the use of the scaffold keeps the majority of the fluorophores out of the quenching zone, leading to increased fluorescence intensity and mild levels of enhancement. The results show that the degree of enhancement can be controlled by exploiting capsid scaffolds of different sizes and tuning capsid-AuNP distances. These bioinspired plasmonic nanostructures provide a flexible design for manipulating photonic excitation and photoemission.

Title: Use of hygiene protocols to control the spread of viruses in a hotel.
Abstract: The goals of this study were to observe the spread of viruses in a hotel setting and to assess the effectiveness of a hygiene intervention in reducing their spread. Selected fomites in one hotel room were inoculated with bacteriophage ϕx-174, and fomites in a conference center within the same hotel were inoculated using bacteriophage MS2. Cleaning of the contaminated room resulted in the spread of viruses to other rooms by the housekeeping staff. Furthermore, viruses were transferred by hotel guests to the conference center and a communal kitchen area. Additionally, conference attendees transferred viruses from the conference center to their hotel rooms and a communal kitchen area. This study demonstrated how viruses can be spread throughout a hotel setting by both housekeepers and guests. A hygiene intervention, which included providing hand hygiene products and facial tissues to the guests and disinfecting solutions with disposable wipes to the housekeeping staff, was successful in reducing the spread of viruses between the hotel guest rooms and conference center. The hygiene intervention resulted in significantly reduced transfer of the ϕx-174 between the contaminated hotel room and other hotel rooms, communal areas, and the conference center (p = 0.02).

Title: Grazing of heterotrophic flagellates on viruses is driven by feeding behaviour.
Abstract: The trophic interactions between viruses, bacteria and protists play a crucial role in structuring microbial communities and regulating nutrient and organic matter flux. Here, we show that the impact on viral density by heterotrophic flagellates is related to their feeding behaviour (feeding on sedimented particles - Thaumatomonas coloniensis, filter feeding of suspended particles - Salpingoeca sp., and actively searching raptorial feeding - Goniomonas truncata). Phage MS2 was co-incubated with flagellates and the natural bacterial and viral community originating from the same groundwater habitats where the flagellates were isolated. Three complementary assays, i.e. flow cytometry, qPCR and plaque assay, were used for enumeration of total viruses, total MS2 phages, and free and infectious MS2, respectively, to provide insights into the grazing mechanisms of the flagellates on viruses. Phage MS2 was actively removed by the suspension feeders T. coloniensis and Salpingoeca sp. in contrast with the actively raptoriale grazer G. truncata. The decline of viral titre was demonstrated to be caused by ingestion rather than random absorption by both qPCR and locating protein fluorescently labelled MS2 inside the flagellates. Further, we indicate that phages can be used as a minor carbon source for flagellates. Collectively, these data demonstrate that eliminating viruses can be an important function of protists in microbial food webs, carbon cycling and potentially water quality control.

Title: Effect of hydraulically reversible and hydraulically irreversible fouling on the removal of MS2 and φX174 bacteriophage by an ultrafiltration membrane.
Abstract: The effect of membrane fouling on the removal of enteric virus surrogates MS2 and φX174 bacteriophage by an ultrafiltration membrane was assessed under simulated full-scale drinking water treatment operating conditions. Filtration experiments of up to 8 days using either river or lake water ascertained how the membrane fouling layer affected virus removal. Organic carbon fractionation techniques identified potential foulants, including biopolymers, in the feed water and in the permeate. Hydraulically irreversible fouling could greatly improve the removal of both viruses at moderate and severe fouling conditions by up to 2.5 logs. Hydraulically reversible fouling increased virus removal only slightly, and increased removal of >0.5 log for both phage were only obtained under severe fouling conditions. The increase in virus removal due to irreversible and reversible fouling differed between the two water sources. As the degree of fouling increased, differences between the removal of the two phage decreased. Maintenance cleaning partially removed membrane foulants, however virus removal following maintenance cleaning was lower than that of the fouled membrane, it remained higher than that of the clean membrane.

Title: Multivalent viral capsids with internal cargo for fibrin imaging.
Abstract: Thrombosis is the cause of many cardiovascular syndromes and is a significant contributor to life-threatening diseases, such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Thrombus targeted imaging agents have the capability to provide molecular information about pathological clots, potentially improving detection, risk stratification, and therapy of thrombosis-related diseases. Nanocarriers are a promising platform for the development of molecular imaging agents as they can be modified to have external targeting ligands and internal functional cargo. In this work, we report the synthesis and use of chemically functionalized bacteriophage MS2 capsids as biomolecule-based nanoparticles for fibrin imaging. The capsids were modified using an oxidative coupling reaction, conjugating ∼90 copies of a fibrin targeting peptide to the exterior of each protein shell. The ability of the multivalent, targeted capsids to bind fibrin was first demonstrated by determining the impact on thrombin-mediated clot formation. The modified capsids out-performed the free peptides and were shown to inhibit clot formation at effective concentrations over ten-fold lower than the monomeric peptide alone. The installation of near-infrared fluorophores on the interior surface of the capsids enabled optical detection of binding to fibrin clots. The targeted capsids bound to fibrin, exhibiting higher signal-to-background than control, non-targeted MS2-based nanoagents. The in vitro assessment of the capsids suggests that fibrin-targeted MS2 capsids could be used as delivery agents to thrombi for diagnostic or therapeutic applications.

Title: Mimicking filtration and transport of rotavirus and adenovirus in sand media using DNA-labeled, protein-coated silica nanoparticles.
Abstract: Rotavirus (RoV) and adenovirus (AdV) are important viral pathogens for the risk analysis of drinking water. Despite this, little is known about their retention and transport behaviors in porous media due to a lack of representative surrogates. We developed RoV and AdV surrogates by covalently coupling 70-nm sized silica nanoparticles with specific proteins and a DNA marker for sensitive detection. Filtration experiments using beach sand columns demonstrated the similarity of the surrogates' concentrations, filtration efficiencies and attachment kinetics to those of the target viruses. The surrogates showed the same magnitude of concentration reduction as the viruses. Conversely, MS2 phage (a traditional virus model) over-predicted concentrations of AdV and RoV by 1- and 2-orders of magnitude respectively. The surrogates remained stable in size, surface charge and DNA concentration for at least one year. They can be easily and rapidly detected down to a single particle. Preliminary tests suggest that they were readily detectable in a number of environmental waters and treated effluent. With up-scaling validation in pilot trials, the surrogates developed here could be a cost-effective new tool for studying virus retention and transport in porous media. Examples include assessing filter efficacy in water and wastewater treatment, tracking virus migration in groundwater after effluent land disposal, and establishing safe setback distances for groundwater protection.

In order to prevent the transmission of waterborne viral diseases, the analysis of the disinfection kinetics and the quantification of infectious viral pathogens and indicators are highly relevant and need to be addressed. The families Adenoviridae and Polyomaviridae comprise human and animal pathogenic viruses that have been also proposed as indicators of fecal contamination in water and as Microbial Source Tracking tools. While it has been previously suggested that dsDNA viruses may be highly resistant to UVC radiation compared to other viruses or bacteria, no information is available on the stability of polyomavirus toward UV irradiation. Here, the inactivation of dsDNA (HAdV2 and JCPyV) and ssRNA (MS2 bacteriophage) viruses was analyzed at increasing UVC fluences. A minor decay of 2-logs was achieved for both infectious JC polyomaviruses (JCPyV) and human adenoviruses 2 (HAdV2) exposed to a UVC fluence of 1,400 J/m(2), while a decay of 4-log was observed for MS2 bacteriophages (ssRNA). The present study reveals the high UVC resistance of dsDNA viruses, and the UV fluences needed to efficiently inactivate JCPyV and HAdV2 are predicted. Furthermore, we show that in conjunction with appropriate mathematical models, qPCR data may be used to accurately estimate virus infectivity.

Rating: ChatCompletionMessage(content='This abstract is not directly relevant to the goal of using the MS2 phage in phage therapy on multidrug-resistant E. coli. The focus is more on understanding the disinfection kinetics of different viruses, including dsDNA viruses like Adenoviridae and Polyomaviridae, when exposed to UVC radiation. While it does mention the resistance of the MS2 bacteriophage to UVC, the primary emphasis is on the comparison with dsDNA viruses rather than on modifying the MS2 phage lysis protein for phage therapy. \n\nRating: 2/10', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)

Title: A recombinant RNA bacteriophage system to identify functionally important nucleotides in a self-cleaving ribozyme.
Abstract: RNA bacteriophages like Qbeta and MS2 are well known for their high mutation rate, short infection cycle and strong selection against foreign inserts. The hammerhead ribozyme (HHRz) is a small self-cleaving RNA molecule whose active residues have previously been identified by mutational analysis of each individual base. Here the functionally important bases of HHRz were determined in a single screening experiment by inserting the HHRz into the genome of MS2.

Title: Comparison of ZetaPlus 60S and nitrocellulose membrane filters for the simultaneous concentration of F-RNA coliphages, porcine teschovirus and porcine adenovirus from river water.
Abstract: Increasing attention is being paid to the impact of agricultural activities on water quality to understand the impact on public health. F-RNA coliphages have been proposed as viral indicators of fecal contamination while porcine teschovirus (PTV) and porcine adenovirus (PAdV) are proposed indicators of fecal contamination of swine origin. Viruses and coliphages are present in water in very low concentrations and must be concentrated to permit their detection. There is little information comparing the effectiveness of the methods for concentrating F-RNA coliphages with concentration methods for other viruses and vice versa. The objective of this study was to compare 5 current published methods for recovering F-RNA coliphages, PTV and PAdV from river water samples concentrated by electronegative nitrocellulose membrane filters (methods A and B) or electropositive Zeta Plus 60S filters (methods C-E). Method A is used routinely for the detection of coliphages (Méndez et al., 2004) and method C (Brassard et al., 2005) is the official method in Health Canada's compendium for the detection of viruses in bottled mineral or spring water. When river water was inoculated with stocks of F-RNA MS2, PAdV, and PTV to final concentrations of 1×10(6) PFU/100 mL, 1×10(5) gc/100 mL and 3×10(5) gc/100 mL, respectively, a significantly higher recovery for each virus was consistently obtained for method A with recoveries of 52% for MS2, 95% for PAdV, and 1.5% for PTV. When method A was compared with method C for the detection of F-coliphages, PAdV and PTV in river water samples, viruses were detected with higher frequencies and at higher mean numbers with method A than with method C. With method A, F-coliphages were detected in 11/12 samples (5-154 PFU/100 mL), PTV in 12/12 samples (397-10,951 gc/100 mL), PAdV in 1/12 samples (15 gc/100 mL), and F-RNA GIII in 1/12 samples (750 gc/100 mL) while F-RNA genotypes I, II, and IV were not detected by qRT-PCR.

Title: MS2 bacteriophage reduction and microbial communities in biosand filters.
Abstract: This study evaluated the role of physical and biological filter characteristics on the reduction of MS2 bacteriophage in biosand filters (BSFs). Three full-scale concrete Version 10 BSFs, each with a 55 cm sand media depth and a 12 L charge volume, reached 4 log10 reduction of MS2 within 43 days of operation. A consistently high reduction of MS2 between 4 log10 and 7 log10 was demonstrated for up to 294 days. Further examining one of the filters revealed that an average of 2.8 log10 reduction of MS2 was achieved within the first 5 cm of the filter, and cumulative virus reduction reached an average of 5.6 log10 after 240 days. Core sand samples from this filter were taken for protein, carbohydrate, and genomic extraction. Higher reduction of MS2 in the top 5 cm of the sand media (0.56 log10 reduction per cm vs 0.06 log10 reduction per cm for the rest of the filter depth) coincided with greater diversity of microbial communities and increased concentrations of carbohydrates. In the upper layers, "Candidatus Nitrosopumilus maritimus" and "Ca. Nitrospira defluvii" were found as dominant populations, while significant amounts of Thiobacillus-related OTUs were detected in the lower layers. Proteolytic bacterial populations such as the classes Sphingobacteria and Clostridia were observed over the entire filter depth. Thus, this study provides the first insight into microbial community structures that may play a role in MS2 reduction in BSF ecosystems. Overall, besides media ripening and physical reduction mechanisms such as filter depth and long residence time (45 min vs 24 ± 8.5 h), the establishment of chemolithotrophs and proteolytic bacteria could greatly enhance the reduction of MS2.

Title: Adsorption of bacteriophage MS2 to magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in aqueous solutions.
Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate the adsorption of bacteriophage MS2 by magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in aqueous solutions. The characteristics of synthetic nanoparticles were analyzed using various techniques. The adsorption of MS2 to the nanoparticles was examined under various conditions using batch experiments. The results showed that the nanoparticles were mainly composed of maghemite along with goethite. The nanoparticles had a specific surface area of 82.2 m(2) g(-1), with an average pore diameter of 13.2 nm and total pore volume of 0.2703 cm(3) g(-1). The results demonstrated that the removal of MS2 by the nanoparticles was very fast. A 3.15 log removal (99.93%) was achieved within 60 min (adsorbent dose = 2 g L(-1); MS2 concentration = 2.94 × 10(6) pfu mL(-1)). The log removal decreased from 3.52 to 0.36 with increasing MS2 concentration from 1.59 × 10(4) to 5.01 × 10(7) pfu mL(-1). Also, the effect of solution pH on MS2 removal was minimal at pH 4.2-8.4. The removal of MS2 decreased in the presence of anions such as carbonate and phosphate, with the latter showing a greater hindrance effect on removal. This study demonstrated that magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles are very effective in the removal of MS2 from aqueous solutions.

Title: Comparison of five bacteriophages as models for viral aerosol studies.
Abstract: Bacteriophages are perceived to be good models for the study of airborne viruses because they are safe to use, some of them display structural features similar to those of human and animal viruses, and they are relatively easy to produce in large quantities. Yet, only a few studies have investigated them as models. It has previously been demonstrated that aerosolization, environmental conditions, and sampling conditions affect viral infectivity, but viral infectivity is virus dependent. Thus, several virus models are likely needed to study their general behavior in aerosols. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of aerosolization and sampling on the infectivity of five tail-less bacteriophages and two pathogenic viruses: MS2 (a single-stranded RNA [ssRNA] phage of the Leviviridae family), Φ6 (a segmented double-stranded RNA [dsRNA] phage of the Cystoviridae family), ΦX174 (a single-stranded DNA [ssDNA] phage of the Microviridae family), PM2 (a double-stranded DNA [dsDNA] phage of the Corticoviridae family), PR772 (a dsDNA phage of the Tectiviridae family), human influenza A virus H1N1 (an ssRNA virus of the Orthomyxoviridae family), and the poultry virus Newcastle disease virus (NDV; an ssRNA virus of the Paramyxoviridae family). Three nebulizers and two nebulization salt buffers (with or without organic fluid) were tested, as were two aerosol sampling devices, a liquid cyclone (SKC BioSampler) and a dry cyclone (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health two-stage cyclone bioaerosol sampler). The presence of viruses in collected air samples was detected by culture and quantitative PCR (qPCR). Our results showed that these selected five phages behave differently when aerosolized and sampled. RNA phage MS2 and ssDNA phage ΦX174 were the most resistant to aerosolization and sampling. The presence of organic fluid in the nebulization buffer protected phages PR772 and Φ6 throughout the aerosolization and sampling with dry cyclones. In this experimental setup, the behavior of the influenza virus resembled that of phages PR772 and Φ6, while the behavior of NDV was closer to that of phages MS2 and ΦX174. These results provide critical information for the selection of appropriate phage models to mimic the behavior of specific human and animal viruses in aerosols.

Rating: ChatCompletionMessage(content='This abstract provides valuable information on the behavior of various bacteriophages and pathogenic viruses in aerosols, including the MS2 phage.

Title: Decay of enteric microorganisms in biosolids-amended soil under wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivation.
Abstract: There is a growing need for better assessment of health risks associated with land-applied biosolids. This study investigated in-situ decay of seeded human adenovirus (HAdV), Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, and bacteriophage (MS2) in biosolids-amended soil under wheat cultivation. The biosolids seeded with microorganisms were placed in decay chambers which were then placed in the topsoil (10 cm depth) at three different sites. Sites were selected in arid wheat-growing regions of Australia with loamy-sand soil type (Western Australia) and sandy soil (South Australia). Seeded E. coli and S. enterica had a relatively short decay time (T90 = 4-56 days) in biosolids-amended soil compared to un-amended soil (T90 = 8-83 days). The decreasing soil moisture over the wheat-growing season significantly (P < 0.05) influenced survival time of both bacteria and MS2 at Western Australia (Moora) and South Australia (Mt Compass) sites, particularly in the un-amended soils. Increasing soil temperature also significantly (P < 0.05) influenced the decay of MS2 at these sites. In this study, no notable decline in HAdV numbers (PCR detectable units) was observed in both biosolids-amended and the un-amended soils at all three sites. The HAdV decay time (T90 ≥ 180 days) in biosolids-amended and un-amended soils was significantly higher than MS2 (T90 = 22-108 days). The results of this study suggest that adenovirus could survive for a longer period of time (>180 days) during the winter in biosolids-amended soil. The stability of adenovirus suggests that consideration towards biosolids amendment frequency, time, rates and appropriate withholding periods are necessary for risk mitigation.

Title: Antiviral effects of persimmon extract on human norovirus and its surrogate, bacteriophage MS2.
Abstract: Human noroviruses (NoVs) are the leading cause of gastroenteritis and foodborne illnesses worldwide. In this study, we investigated the effects of persimmon extract (PE) on NoV GII.4 and bacteriophage MS2. We also examined the relationship between the tannin content of PE and its antiviral effects to identify the active ingredient in PE. Different persimmon tannin (PT) solutions were prepared by mixing PE with different concentrations of bovine serum albumin. The antiviral efficacy of these solutions against NoV was evaluated by quantifying the amount of residual noroviral genome using a quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assay. The antiviral efficacy of PE against MS2 was examined with an infectivity assay (plaque assay). Solutions containing ≥ 0.11 mg/mL PT reduced the noroviral genome by more than 70.0% and the infectivity of MS2 by more than 2.5 log PFU/mL. However, the effects of PT on both viruses decreased markedly at a concentration of 0.08 mg/mL and solutions containing negligible PT had no antiviral activity. These results suggest that the PT component of PE inactivates NoV and MS2. Our results indicate that PE is a nontoxic antiviral agent effective against enteric viruses.

Title: Evaluation of an anion exchange resin-based method for concentration of F-RNA coliphages (enteric virus indicators) from water samples.
Abstract: Enteric viral contaminants in water represent a public health concern, thus methods for detecting these viruses or their indicator microorganisms are needed. Because enteric viruses and their viral indicators are often found at low concentrations in water, their detection requires upfront concentration methods. In this study, a strong basic anion exchange resin was evaluated as an adsorbent material for the concentration of F-RNA coliphages (MS2, Qβ, GA, and HB-P22). These coliphages are recognized as enteric virus surrogates and fecal indicator organisms. Following adsorption of the coliphages from 50ml water samples, direct RNA isolation and real time RT-PCR detection were performed. In water samples containing 10(5)pfu/ml of the F-RNA coliphages, the anion exchange resin (IRA-900) adsorbed over 96.7% of the coliphages present, improving real time RT-PCR detection by 5-7 cycles compared to direct testing. F-RNA coliphage RNA recovery using the integrated method ranged from 12.6% to 77.1%. Resin-based concentration of samples with low levels of the F-RNA coliphages allowed for 10(0)pfu/ml (MS2 and Qβ) and 10(-1)pfu/ml (GA and HB-P22) to be detected. The resin-based method offers considerable advantages in cost, speed, simplicity and field adaptability.

Title: Transport and removal of bacteriophages MS2 and PhiX174 in steel slag-amended soils: column experiments and transport model analyses.
Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate the removal of bacteriophages MS2 and PhiX174 in soils amended with converter furnace steel slag. Column experiments were performed to examine the bacteriophage removal in slag-amended (slag content: 0%, 25%, and 50%) loam soils. For comparison, column experiments were also conducted with Escherichia coli. In addition, chloride (Cl) was used as a conservative tracer to determine transport characteristics. Results showed mass recoveries of Cl of 98.6 +/- 3.5%, indicating that the experiments were conducted successfully. The mass recovery of MS2 was 86.7% in no slag (100% soil), decreasing to 0% in slag contents of 25% and 50%. The mass recovery of PhiX174 decreased from 87.8% to 51.5% with increasing slag content from 0% to 50%. In the case of E. coli, the mass recoveries decreased from 47.0% to 10.5% with increasing slag content from 0% to 50%. In the transport models analyses, the HYDRUS-1D code was used to quantify the sorption parameters from breakthrough curves. For the 100% soil column, a one-site kinetic sorption model was fitted to the data, whereas a two-site kinetic sorption model was fitted for slag-amended (25% and 50% slag) soil data. Results demonstrate that the addition of steel slag to soil enhances the removal of bacteriophages due to the presence of FeO in the steel slag. However, CaO could not contribute to the bacteriophage removal in our experimental conditions because the effluent pH (7.7-8.9) in slag-amended (25% and 50% slag) soils was not high enough to promote the bacteriophage inactivation.

Title: Photoreactivation of bacteriophages after UV disinfection: role of genome structure and impacts of UV source.
Abstract: The UV inactivation kinetics of bacteriophages MS2, PhiX174, T1 and PRD1 and the potential of bacterial UV repair mechanisms to reactivate these bacteriophages is described here. The selected bacteriophages represent a range of genome size, single and double stranded genomes, circular and linear organization and RNA and DNA. Bacteriophages were exposed to UV irradiation from two different collimated beam UV irradiation sources (medium-pressure (MP) mercury lamps and low-pressure (LP) mercury lamps) and assayed during which host-phage cultures were exposed to photoreactivating light for 6 h, then incubated overnight at 37 °C in the dark. Dark controls following UV exposure were performed in parallel. UV inactivation kinetics (using dark controls) showed that circular ssDNA phage (PhiX174) was the most sensitive and linear ssRNA phage (MS2) was the more resistant phage. No photoreactivation was observed for MS2 (RNA phage) and the highest photoreactivation was observed for PRD1. In the case of PRD1, the dose required for 4-log reduction (dark control) was around 35 mJ/cm(2), with a similar dose observed for both UV sources (MP and LP). When the photoreactivation step was added, the dose required for 4-log reduction using LP lamps was 103 mJ/cm(2) and for MP lamps was 60 mJ/cm(2). Genome organization differences between bacteriophages play an important role in resistance to UV inactivation and potential photoreactivation mediated by bacterial host mechanisms. The use of photoreactivation during the assay of PRD1 creates a more conservative surrogate for potential use in UV challenge testing.

Title: Oligonucleotide microarray chip for the quantification of MS2, ΦX174, and adenoviruses on the multiplex analysis platform MCR 3.
Abstract: Pathogenic viruses are emerging contaminants in water which should be analyzed for water safety to preserve public health. A strategy was developed to quantify RNA and DNA viruses in parallel on chemiluminescence flow-through oligonucleotide microarrays. In order to show the proof of principle, bacteriophage MS2, ΦX174, and the human pathogenic adenovirus type 2 (hAdV2) were analyzed in spiked tap water samples on the analysis platform MCR 3. The chemiluminescence microarray imaging unit was equipped with a Peltier heater for a controlled heating of the flow cell. The efficiency and selectivity of DNA hybridization could be increased resulting in higher signal intensities and lower cross-reactivities of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products from other viruses. The total analysis time for DNA/RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis for RNA viruses, polymerase chain reaction, single-strand separation, and oligonucleotide microarray analysis was performed in 4-4.5 h. The parallel quantification was possible in a concentration range of 9.6 × 10(5)-1.4 × 10(10) genomic units (GU)/mL for bacteriophage MS2, 1.4 × 10(5)-3.7 × 10(8) GU/mL for bacteriophage ΦX174, and 6.5 × 10(3)-1.2 × 10(5) for hAdV2, respectively, by using a measuring temperature of 40 °C. Detection limits could be calculated to 6.6 × 10(5) GU/mL for MS2, 5.3 × 10(3) GU/mL for ΦX174, and 1.5 × 10(2) GU/mL for hAdV2, respectively. Real samples of surface water and treated wastewater were tested. Generally, found concentrations of hAdV2, bacteriophage MS2, and ΦX174 were at the detection limit. Nevertheless, bacteriophages could be identified with similar results by means of quantitative PCR and oligonucleotide microarray analysis on the MCR 3.

Title: Sunlight inactivation of MS2 coliphage in the absence of photosensitizers: modeling the endogenous inactivation rate using a photoaction spectrum.
Abstract: The endogenous sunlight inactivation rates of MS2 coliphage in photosensitizer-free water were measured (kobs) under different light conditions and compared to modeled inactivation rates (kmod) computed using a previously published action spectrum. Experiments were conducted under simulated and natural sunlight. There was generally good agreement between modeled and observed MS2 sunlight inactivation rates in the summer and winter, suggesting that the action spectrum can be used to predict changes in the inactivation rate caused by diurnal and seasonal changes in natural sunlight irradiance. However, we show that a major source of uncertainty in the predictions is the ability to accurately measure or model the comparatively weak and highly variable solar irradiance between 280 and 300 nm, a range to which the inactivation rate is very sensitive. The action spectrum was also used to predict the endogenous inactivation rates of MS2 at different depths in a column of strongly humic-colored [i.e., solar ultraviolet (UV)-attenuating] wetland water under simulated sunlight; we observed fairly good agreement between kobs and kmod, suggesting that the action spectrum can be used to estimate the decrease in the endogenous inactivation rate caused by spectrally selective sunlight attenuation in the water column.

Title: Evaluating efficacy of field-generated electrochemical oxidants on disinfection of fomites using bacteriophage MS2 and mouse norovirus MNV-1 as pathogenic virus surrogates.
Abstract: Surface disinfection, as part of environmental hygiene practices, is an efficient barrier to gastroenteritis transmission. However, surface disinfectants may be difficult to obtain in remote, resource-limited, or disaster relief settings. Electrochemical oxidants (ECO) are chlorine-based disinfectants that can be generated using battery power to electrolyze brine (NaCl) solutions. Electrolysis generates a mixed-oxidant solution that contains both chlorine (HOCl, OCl(-)) and reactive oxygen species (e.g., ·OH, O3, H2O2, and ·O2-) capable of inactivating pathogens. One onsite generator of ECO is the Smart Electrochlorinator 200 (SE-200, Cascade Designs, Inc.). In a laboratory study, we assessed ECO surface disinfection efficacy for two gastrointestinal virus surrogates: bacteriophage MS2 and murine norovirus MNV-1. We quantified both infectivity and nucleic acid inactivation using culture-dependent and independent assays. At free available chlorine concentrations of 2,500 ppm and a contact time of 30 s, ECO inactivation of infective MS2 bacteriophage exceeded 7 log10 compared to MNV-1 disinfection of approximately 2 log10. Genomic RNA inactivation was less than infective virus inactivation: MS2 RNA inactivation was approximately 5 log10 compared to MNV-1 RNA inactivation of approximately 1.5 log10. The results are similar to inactivation efficacy of household bleach when used at similar free available chlorine concentrations. Our work demonstrates the potential of ECO solutions, generated onsite, to be used for surface disinfection.

Title: Survival of airborne MS2 bacteriophage generated from human saliva, artificial saliva, and cell culture medium.
Abstract: Laboratory studies of virus aerosols have been criticized for generating airborne viruses from artificial nebulizer suspensions (e.g., cell culture media), which do not mimic the natural release of viruses (e.g., from human saliva). The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of human saliva on the infectivity and survival of airborne virus and to compare it with those of artificial saliva and cell culture medium. A stock of MS2 bacteriophage was diluted in one of three nebulizer suspensions, aerosolized, size selected (100 to 450 nm) using a differential mobility analyzer, and collected onto gelatin filters. Uranine was used as a particle tracer. The resulting particle size distribution was measured using a scanning mobility particle sizer. The amounts of infectious virus, total virus, and fluorescence in the collected samples were determined by infectivity assays, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), and spectrofluorometry, respectively. For all nebulizer suspensions, the virus content generally followed a particle volume distribution rather than a number distribution. The survival of airborne MS2 was independent of particle size but was strongly affected by the type of nebulizer suspension. Human saliva was found to be much less protective than cell culture medium (i.e., 3% tryptic soy broth) and artificial saliva. These results indicate the need for caution when extrapolating laboratory results, which often use artificial nebulizer suspensions. To better assess the risk of airborne transmission of viral diseases in real-life situations, the use of natural suspensions such as saliva or respiratory mucus is recommended.

Title: Rapid and efficient filtration-based procedure for separation and safe analysis of CBRN mixed samples.
Abstract: Separating CBRN mixed samples that contain both chemical and biological warfare agents (CB mixed sample) in liquid and solid matrices remains a very challenging issue. Parameters were set up to assess the performance of a simple filtration-based method first optimized on separate C- and B-agents, and then assessed on a model of CB mixed sample. In this model, MS2 bacteriophage, Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis baculovirus (AcNPV), Bacillus atrophaeus and Bacillus subtilis spores were used as biological agent simulants whereas ethyl methylphosphonic acid (EMPA) and pinacolyl methylphophonic acid (PMPA) were used as VX and soman (GD) nerve agent surrogates, respectively. Nanoseparation centrifugal devices with various pore size cut-off (30 kD up to 0.45 µm) and three RNA extraction methods (Invisorb, EZ1 and Nuclisens) were compared. RNA (MS2) and DNA (AcNPV) quantification was carried out by means of specific and sensitive quantitative real-time PCRs (qPCR). Liquid chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC/TOFMS) methods was used for quantifying EMPA and PMPA. Culture methods and qPCR demonstrated that membranes with a 30 kD cut-off retain more than 99.99% of biological agents (MS2, AcNPV, Bacillus Atrophaeus and Bacillus subtilis spores) tested separately. A rapid and reliable separation of CB mixed sample models (MS2/PEG-400 and MS2/EMPA/PMPA) contained in simple liquid or complex matrices such as sand and soil was also successfully achieved on a 30 kD filter with more than 99.99% retention of MS2 on the filter membrane, and up to 99% of PEG-400, EMPA and PMPA recovery in the filtrate. The whole separation process turnaround-time (TAT) was less than 10 minutes. The filtration method appears to be rapid, versatile and extremely efficient. The separation method developed in this work constitutes therefore a useful model for further evaluating and comparing additional separation alternative procedures for a safe handling and preparation of CB mixed samples.

Title: Simple synthetic method toward solid supported c60 visible light-activated photocatalysts.
Abstract: Solid supported fullerene materials are prepared in aims of creating a fullerene-based photocatalyst that is capable of producing (1)O2 in the aqueous phase. Past studies of using fullerene as a photocatalyst in water have exclusively focused on using water soluble fullerene derivatives and employed sophisticated chemistry to create immobilized fullerene materials. The method presented herein is much less synthetically complex and utilizes pristine fullerene, providing a drastically simpler route to supported fullerene materials and furthering their potential for use in environmental applications. Covalent immobilization was achieved through the nucleophilic addition of a terminal amine (located on a solid support) across a [6,6] fullerene double bond, resulting in attachment directly to C60's cage. Immobilization allowed supported fullerene moieties to produce (1)O2 in water under various illumination conditions and inactivate MS2 bacteriophages. In a water with natural organic matter, supported fullerene materials produced (1)O2 under visible light irradiation without exhibiting significant loss of photocatalytic activity after successive cycling.

Rating: ChatCompletionMessage(content='This abstract discusses a method for preparing supported fullerene materials that can produce (1)O2 in water under various illumination conditions and effectively inactivate MS2 bacteriophages.

Title: Inactivation of F-specific bacteriophages during flocculation with polyaluminum chloride - a mechanistic study.
Abstract: Bacteriophages are often used as surrogates for enteric viruses in spiking experiments to determine the efficiencies of virus removal of certain water treatment measures, like e.g. flocculation or filtration steps. Such spiking experiments with bacteriophages are indispensable if the natural virus concentrations in the raw water of water treatment plants are too low to allow the determination of elimination levels over several orders of magnitude. In order to obtain reliable results from such spiking tests, it is essential that bacteriophages behave comparable to viruses and remain stable during the experiments. To test this, the influence of flocculation parameters on the bacteriophages MS2, Qβ and phiX174 was examined. Notably, the F-specific phages MS2 and Qβ were found to be inactivated in flocculation processes with polyaluminum chloride (PACl). In contrast, other aluminum coagulants like AlCl3 or Al2(SO4)3 did not show a comparable effect on MS2 in this study. In experiments testing the influence of different PACl species on MS2 and Qβ inactivation during flocculation, it could be shown that cationic dissolved PACl species (Al13) interacted with the MS2 surface and hereby reduced the surviving phage fraction to c/c0 values below 1*10(-4) even at very low PACl concentrations of 7 μmol Al/L. Other inactivation mechanisms like the irreversible adsorption of phages to the floc structure or the damage of phage surfaces due to entrapment into the floc during coagulation and floc formation do not seem to contribute to the low surviving fraction found for both F-specific bacteriophages. Furthermore, no influence of phage agglomeration or pH drops during the flocculation process on phage inactivation could be observed. The somatic coliphage phiX174 in contrast did not show sensitivity to chemical stress and in accordance only slight interaction between Al13 and the phage surface was observed. Consequently, F-specific phages like MS2 should not be used as surrogate for viruses in flocculation experiments with PACl to determine the removal rates of viruses, as the results are influenced by a strong inactivation of the bacteriophages due to the experimental conditions.

Title: Bacteria and virus removal effectiveness of ceramic pot filters with different silver applications in a long term experiment.
Abstract: In 2012 more than 4 million people used a ceramic pot filter (CPF) as household water treatment system for their daily drinking water needs. In the normal production protocol most low cost filters are impregnated with a silver solution to enhance the microbial removal efficiency. The aim of this study was to determine the role of silver during the filtration and subsequent storage. Twenty-two CPFs with three different silver applications (non, only outside and both sides) were compared in a long-term loading experiment with Escherichia coli (K12 and WR1) and MS2 bacteriophages in natural challenge water under highly controlled laboratory circumstances. No significant difference in Log Removal Values were found between the filters with different silver applications. The results show that the storage time in the receptacle is the dominant parameter to reach E. coli inactivation by silver, and not the contact time during the filtration phase. The hypothesis that the absence of silver would enhance the virus removal, due to biofilm formation on the ceramic filter element, could not be confirmed. The removal effectiveness for viruses is still of major concern for the CPF. This study suggests that the ceramic pot filter characteristics, such as burnt material content, do not determine E. coli removal efficacies, but rather the contact time with silver during storage is the dominant parameter to reach E. coli inactivation.

Title: Electrochemical biosensors featuring oriented antibody immobilization via electrografted and self-assembled hydrazide chemistry.
Abstract: Appropriate site-directed chemistry is essential to maximize the performance of immunosensors. We present two new functionalization strategies that preserve proper folding and binding potential of antibodies by forcing their oriented immobilization. Both strategies are based on the formation of hydrazone bonds between aldehyde groups on the Fc moieties of periodate-oxidized antibodies and hydrazide groups on functionalized gold electrodes. Those hydrazide groups are introduced by electrografting of diazonium salts or by self assembly of mono- and dithiolated hydrazide linkers, resulting in films with tailored functional groups and, thus, antibody distribution and spacing. Their barrier properties and permeability toward electroactive species are evaluated. To demonstrate the potential of these new functionalization strategies, detection of bacteriophage MS2 is performed through either a direct assay using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) or through a sandwich assay using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). Diazonium and monothiolated self-assembled monolayer-modified electrodes enable the detection of less than 1 plaque forming unit (pfu)/mL in a direct EIS assay. However, nonspecific adsorption renders measurements in river water samples difficult. In contrast, sandwich-assays on electrodes with electrografted diazonium salts and monothiolated self-assembled monolayers do not show significant matrix effects using river water samples, but the limits of detection are 10(8) times higher than those of the direct assay. Best results are achieved for immunosensors based on mixed monolayers of hydrazide and hydroxyl diothiolated linkers (15 pfu/mL). These new functionalization techniques are facile to implement. They afford the possibility to tune the surface composition and tailor the electrochemical properties of electrochemical sensors. These advantages should translate into broad interest in this type of surface chemistry for biosensor development.

Title: Inactivation of MS2 coliphage by UV and hydrogen peroxide: comparison by cultural and molecular methodologies.
Abstract: The use of advanced oxidation processes (AOP) are expected to increase for removal of emerging contaminants and pathogens from drinking water. In this study, the performance of a small community ultraviolet light reactor in combination with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for MS2 coliphage inactivation with two different flow rate conditions of 1 gal/min (gpm) and 2 gpm was evaluated. Following UV radiation, MS2 showed a reduction of 5.3-5.8 log10 when quantified with cultural plaque counts, whereas corresponding quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) data showed only a 1.7-2.8 log10 reduction in viral RNA copy number. When H2O2 was added at either 2.5 or 5 ppm with UV at both flow rate conditions, enhanced MS2 inactivation occurred with a more than 7 log10 reduction observed via plaque counts, indicating that all added MS2 had been inactivated, since no plaques were formed after incubation at 37 °C for 24 h. In contrast, qPCR only showed a corresponding 3-4 log10 reduction in viral RNA copy number. This research also sheds light on the inactivation of MS2 with ultraviolet light and in the presence of hydroxyl radicals and provides a practical use of qPCR to detect MS2 concentration following advanced oxidation relative to traditional plaque methodology; however qPCR detection overestimates the true number of infective virus.

Title: Intermittent versus continuous operation of biosand filters.
Abstract: The biosand filter is a household-scale point-of-use water filtration system based on slow sand filtration, but modified for intermittent operation. Studies on slow sand filters show that intermittent operation reduces filter effectiveness. However, continuous versus intermittent operation of biosand filters has never been compared. Eight 10-cm diameter columns were constructed to represent field biosand filters. Five were operated intermittently with a 24-h residence period, while the remaining three were operated continuously. Continuous operation of the filters resulted in significantly better reduction of Escherichia coli (3.71 log10 versus 1.67 log10), bacteriophage MS2 (2.25 log10 versus 0.85 log10), and turbidity (96% versus 87%). Dissolved oxygen levels at 5 and 10 cm of media depth in intermittent filters reached an average of 0 mg/L by 24 h of residence time on day 60 of the experiment. A simple numerical model was developed to describe E. coli removal during ripening from days 0-58 for continuously operated versus intermittent filters. This research confirms that although biosand filters were developed for intermittent operation, the filters perform significantly better when operated continuously. However, both operational modes resulted in a significant reduction of microbial indicators.

Title: Concentration of enteric virus indicator from seawater using granular activated carbon.
Abstract: Fecal contamination of shellfish growing seawater with enteric viruses is often associated with human outbreaks of gastroenteritis. Male specific bacteriophage MS2 is correlated with those of enteric viruses in a wide range of water environments and has been used widely as a surrogate for pathogenic waterborne viruses. Since viruses in contaminated water are usually at low levels, the development of methods to concentrate viruses from water is crucial for detection purposes. In the present study, granular activated carbon was evaluated for concentration of MS2 from artificial seawater, and different parameters of the seawater were also compared. Recovery of MS2 from warm seawater (37°C) was found to be significantly greater than from cold seawater (4 and 20°C), and even greater than from fresh water (4, 20 and 37°C); the difference between seawater and fresh water became less profound when the temperatures of both were below 37°C. Although not of statistical significance, recovery of MS2 from low salinity seawater (10 and 20 parts per thousand, ppt) was greater than from high salinity seawater (30 and 40ppt). One gram of granular activated carbon was able to extract 6-log plaque forming units (PFU) of MS2 from 500ml seawater at 37°C. This study demonstrated that granular activated carbon can concentrate an enteric virus indicator from shellfish growing seawater effectively.

Title: Performic acid for advanced wastewater disinfection.
Abstract: The disinfection efficiency of performic acid (PFA) against various microbial contaminants has been studied in municipal secondary effluent. The study demonstrated that PFA provides rapid, efficient and safe disinfection, degrading both bacteria and viruses even at low doses. The resistance order starting from the most resistant microorganism is as follows: MS2-coliphages > DNA-coliphages > enterococci and Escherichia coli. PFA is also efficient in the elimination of Salmonella spp., Clostridium perfringens spores and Giardia cysts. The results showed that a PFA dose as low as 0.5-1 mg L(-1) with contact time of 10 min was efficient in achieving and maintaining for 72 h the disinfection level required for unrestricted agricultural water reuse (≤3 log units for faecal coliforms). However, the optimal dose will depend on the quality of wastewater. Regarding the formation of by-products during disinfection with PFA, very low amounts of hydrogen peroxide and organic per-acids were observed; active oxygen was not detected. The amounts of adsorbable organically bound halogens (AOX) compounds formed were significantly lower compared to the amounts generated during chlorine disinfection. This chlorine-free solution enables compliance with microbiological criteria for various water reuse applications and is already on the market for advanced disinfection.

Title: A double layer plaque assay using spread plate technique for enumeration of bacteriophage MS2.
Abstract: Bacteriophage MS2 is used widely as a model organism to estimate pathogenic virus survival in various environments, and is usually quantified by plaque assay. Although current plaque assays work well in enumeration of MS2 in environmental samples, quantification of MS2 calls for better visibility and higher consistency. In an attempt to improve the visibility and consistency of the current plaque assay, spread plate technique was introduced, instead of the pour plate technique used commonly in existing methods. Other parameters that influence the outcome of the plaque assay were also compared. Using spread plate technique resulted in an increase of plaque size by approximately 50% and contributed to a better visibility. Addition of supplements (glucose, CaCl2 and thiamine); reduction of agar thickness and hardness, also contributed to enhanced plaque visibility and increased plaque count. Among all the conditions tested, a supplemented thin bottom agar (10ml 1% agar) and a supplemented thin top agar (10ml 0.45% agar) with spread plate technique gave the maximum countable plaques with a minimum standard deviation. When compared to other methods, it produced significantly higher plaque count and lower variation. The optimized plaque assay significantly improved visibility and consistency of the existing plaque assay methods and could be used in quantification of MS2.

Title: Microbial inactivation by cupric ion in combination with H2O2: role of reactive oxidants.
Abstract: The cupric ion mediated inactivation of Escherichia coli was enhanced by the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), with increasing inactivation efficacy observed in response to increasing concentrations of H2O2. The biocidal activity of the Cu(II)/H2O2 system is believed to result from the oxidative stress caused by reactive oxidants such as the hydroxyl radical ((•)OH), cupryl species (Cu(III)), and the superoxide radical (O2(•-)), which are produced via the catalytic decomposition of H2O2. In E. coli cells treated with Cu(II) and H2O2, the intracellular level of (•)OH and Cu(III) increased significantly, leading to complete disruption of cell membranes. On the basis of experimental observations made using an (•)OH scavenger, copper-chelating agents, and superoxide dismutase, it is concluded that Cu(III) is the predominant species responsible for the death of E. coli cells. It was also found that the production of Cu(III) was promoted by the reactions of copper with intracellular O2(•-). MS2 coliphage was found to be even more susceptible than E. coli to the oxidative stress induced by the Cu(II)/H2O2 system.

Title: Mechanisms of MS2 bacteriophage removal by fouled ultrafiltration membrane subjected to different cleaning methods.
Abstract: An ultrafiltration unit with a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane of 40 nm nominal pore size was used to study bacteriophage MS2 removal under different membrane conditions: pristine membrane, membrane fouled by soluble microbial product (SMP) extracted from membrane bioreactor (MBR) feedwater, backwashed membrane, and chemically cleaned membrane. The order of MS2 removal by these membranes was as follows: fouled membrane > backwashed membrane > chemically cleaned membrane ≈ pristine membrane. A linear correlation between membrane relative permeability and MS2 removal was found. Mass balance analysis showed a high percentage of MS2 in the concentrate for the fouled membrane as compared with the pristine membrane. Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) results showed faster kinetics of MS2 adhesion to the pristine membrane than to the SMP-fouled membrane. In agreement with QCM results, an attractive force between MS2 and the pristine membrane was detected using an atomic force microscope (AFM), whereas a repulsive force was detected for the interaction between MS2 and the fouled membrane. The presence of SMP on the membrane surface led to higher rejection of MS2 due to both pore blocking and repulsion between MS2 and the SMP layer. Chemical cleaning removed most of the SMP foulant and as a result led to a lower MS2 removal.

Title: An optimized streptavidin-binding RNA aptamer for purification of ribonucleoprotein complexes identifies novel ARE-binding proteins.
Abstract: Determining the composition of messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) particles is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying mRNA regulation, but is technically challenging. Here we present an RNA-based method to identify RNP components using a modified streptavidin (SA)-binding RNA aptamer termed S1m. By optimizing the RNA aptamer S1 in structure and repeat conformation, we improved its affinity for SA and found a 4-fold repeat of S1m (4×S1m) to be more efficient than the established MS2 and PP7 systems from bacteriophages. We then attached the AU-rich element (ARE) of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), a well-known RNA motif that induces mRNA degradation, via 4×S1m to a SA matrix, and used the resulting RNA affinity column to purify ARE-binding proteins (BPs) from cellular extracts. By quantitative mass spectrometry using differential dimethyl labeling, we identified the majority of established ARE-BPs and detected several RNA-BPs that had previously not been associated with AREs. For two of these proteins, Rbms1 and Roxan, we confirmed specific binding to the TNFα ARE. The optimized 4×S1m aptamer, therefore, provides a powerful tool for the discovery of mRNP components in a single affinity purification step.

Title: Chloroplast phosphoglycerate kinase is involved in the targeting of Bamboo mosaic virus to chloroplasts in Nicotiana benthamiana plants.
Abstract: The Bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV) is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. Previously, we identified that the chloroplast phosphoglycerate kinase (chl-PGK) from Nicotiana benthamiana is one of the viral RNA binding proteins involved in the BaMV infection cycle. Because chl-PGK is transported to the chloroplast, we hypothesized that chl-PGK might be involved in viral RNA localization in the chloroplasts. To test this hypothesis, we constructed two green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused mislocalized PGK mutants, the transit peptide deletion mutant (NO TRANSIT PEPTIDE [NOTP]-PGK-GFP) and the nucleus location mutant (nuclear location signal [NLS]-PGK-GFP). Using confocal microscopy, we demonstrated that NOTP-PGK-GFP and NLS-PGK-GFP are localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively, in N. benthamiana plants. When NOTP-PGK-GFP and NLS-PGK-GFP are transiently expressed, we observed a reduction in BaMV coat protein accumulation to 47% and 27% that of the wild-type PGK-GFP, respectively. To localize viral RNA in infected cells, we employed the interaction of NLS-GFP-MS2 (phage MS2 coat protein) with the modified BaMV RNA containing the MS2 coat protein binding sequence. Using confocal microscopy, we observed that BaMV viral RNA localizes to chloroplasts. Furthermore, elongation factor1a fused with the transit peptide derived from chl-PGK or with a Rubisco small subunit can partially restore BaMV accumulation in NbPGK1-knockdown plants by helping BaMV target chloroplasts.

Title: Messenger RNA vaccine based on recombinant MS2 virus-like particles against prostate cancer.
Abstract: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most diagnosed cancer in the western male population with high mortality. Recently, alternative approaches based on immunotherapy including mRNA vaccines for PCa have shown therapeutic promise. However, for mRNA vaccine, several disadvantages such as the instability of mRNA, the high cost of gold particles, the limited production scale for mRNA-transfected dendritic cells in vitro, limit their development. Herein, recombinant bacteriophage MS2 virus-like particles (VLPs), which based on the interaction of a 19-nucleotide RNA aptamer and the coat protein of bacteriophage MS2, successfully addressed these questions, in which target mRNA was packaged by MS2 capsid. MS2 VLP-based mRNA vaccines were easily prepared by recombinant protein technology, nontoxic and RNase-resistant. We show the packaged mRNA was translated into protein as early as 12 hr after phagocytosed by macrophages. Moreover, MS2 VLP-based mRNA vaccines induced strong humoral and cellular immune responses, especially antigen-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) and balanced Th1/Th2 responses without upregulation of CD4(+) regulatory T cells, and protected C57BL/6 mice against PCa completely. As a therapeutic vaccine, MS2 VLP-based mRNA vaccines delayed tumor growth. Our results provide proof of concept on the efficacy and safety of MS2 VLP-based mRNA vaccine, which provides a new delivery approach for mRNA vaccine and implies important clinical value for the prevention and therapy of PCa.

Title: Controlled iodine release from polyurethane sponges for water decontamination.
Abstract: Iodinated polyurethane (IPU) sponges were prepared by immersing sponges in aqueous/organic solutions of iodine or exposing sponges to iodine vapors. Iodine was readily adsorbed into the polymers up to 100% (w/w). The adsorption of iodine on the surface was characterized by XPS and SEM analyses. The iodine loaded IPU sponges were coated with ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), in order to release iodine in a controlled rate for water decontamination combined with active carbon cartridge, which adsorbs the iodine residues after the microbial inactivation. The EVA coated IPU were incorporated in a water purifier and tested for iodine release to water and for microbial inactivation efficiency according to WQA certification program against P231/EPA for 250l, using 25l a day with flow rate of 6-8min/1l. The antimicrobial activity was also studied against Escherichia coli and MS2 phage. Bacterial results exceeded the minimal requirement for bacterial removal of 6log reduction throughout the entire lifespan. At any testing point, no bacteria was detected in the outlet achieving more than 7.1 to more than 8log reduction as calculated upon the inlet concentration. Virus surrogate, MS2, reduction results varied from 4.11log reduction under tap water, and 5.11log reduction under basic water (pH9) to 1.32 for acidic water (pH5). Controlled and stable iodine release was observed with the EVA coated IPU sponges and was effective in deactivating the bacteria and virus present in the contaminated water and thus, these iodinated PU systems could be used in water purification to provide safe drinking water. These sponges may find applications as disinfectants in medicine.

Title: High-throughput assay for temporal kinetic analysis of lytic coliphage activity.
Abstract: Plaque analysis allows the determination of phage titer and multiplicity of infection. Yet, this overnight assay provides only endpoint results, ignoring kinetic aspects. We introduce an alternative high-throughput and rapid method for kinetic analysis of lytic coliphage activity. Escherichia coli was infected with serial dilutions of MS2 coliphage, and bacterial growth was monitored using a multi-well plate reader providing within hours the equivalent data as obtained overnight. Additional information is yielded, including phage replication rate, progeny size per cycle, and viral propagation during bacterial growth. This method offers further insights into physicochemical mechanisms of lytic coliphage infection and temporal control. It also provides a virus-host interaction acumen.

Title: Crystal structure of the bacteriophage Qβ coat protein in complex with the RNA operator of the replicase gene.
Abstract: The coat proteins of single-stranded RNA bacteriophages specifically recognize and bind to a hairpin structure in their genome at the beginning of the replicase gene. The interaction serves to repress the synthesis of the replicase enzyme late in infection and contributes to the specific encapsidation of phage RNA. While this mechanism is conserved throughout the Leviviridae family, the coat protein and operator sequences from different phages show remarkable variation, serving as prime examples for the co-evolution of protein and RNA structure. To better understand the protein-RNA interactions in this virus family, we have determined the three-dimensional structure of the coat protein from bacteriophage Qβ bound to its cognate translational operator. The RNA binding mode of Qβ coat protein shares several features with that of the widely studied phage MS2, but only one nucleotide base in the hairpin loop makes sequence-specific contacts with the protein. Unlike in other RNA phages, the Qβ coat protein does not utilize an adenine-recognition pocket for binding a bulged adenine base in the hairpin stem but instead uses a stacking interaction with a tyrosine side chain to accommodate the base. The extended loop between β strands E and F of Qβ coat protein makes contacts with the lower part of the RNA stem, explaining the greater length dependence of the RNA helix for optimal binding to the protein. Consequently, the complex structure allows the proposal of a mechanism by which the Qβ coat protein recognizes and discriminates in favor of its cognate RNA.

Rating: ChatCompletionMessage(content='This abstract is highly relevant to the goal of using the MS2 phage in phage therapy against multidrug-resistant E. coli.

Title: Decay of Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli and bacteriophage MS2 on the phyllosphere and stored grains of wheat (Triticum aestivum).
Abstract: Cereal crops grown in the biosolids-amended soil can potentially become contaminated with pathogenic micro-organisms during growth and at the time of harvesting. There is small but unquantified potential risk of transfer of enteric pathogens to humans and animals from contaminated plants and grains. This study examined decay of Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and bacteriophage MS2 on the wheat phyllosphere and on stored grains. This was done to assess the health implications of cereal crops contaminated from land application of biosolids. E. coli, S. enterica and MS2 were inoculated onto the leaves, spikelets and grains of wheat. The change in the numbers of inoculated micro-organisms was determined over time to calculate the respective 90% reduction time (T90 ) in each of these environments. A rapid inactivation (T90 <1-3 days) of E. coli and S. enterica and MS2 from the plant phyllosphere was observed, particularly from the spikelets. The decay rates were influenced by micro-organism type and location on the plant phyllosphere. Decay times on the stored grains were longer (T90 9-71 days), with some observed influence of grain variety on pathogen decay times.

Title: Measuring transcription dynamics in living cells using fluctuation analysis.
Abstract: Single-cell studies of gene regulation suggest that transcription dynamics play a fundamental role in determining expression heterogeneity within a population. In addition, the three-dimensional organization of the nucleus seems to both reflect and influence expression patterns in the cell. Therefore, to gain a holistic understanding of transcriptional regulation, it is necessary to develop methods for studying transcription of single genes in living cells with high spatial and temporal resolution. In this chapter, we describe a recently developed approach for visualizing and quantifying pre-mRNA synthesis at a single active gene in the nucleus. The approach is based on the high-affinity interaction between MS2/PP7 bacteriophage coat proteins and RNA hairpins which are transcribed by the gene of interest. The MS2/PP7 coat protein is fused to a fluorescent protein and binds the nascent mRNA, allowing for detection of single transcription events in the fluorescence microscope. By time-lapse fluorescence imaging and quantitative image analysis, one can generate a time trace of fluorescence intensity at the site of transcription. By temporal autocorrelation analysis, one can determine enzymatic activities of RNAP such as initiation rate and elongation rate. In this protocol, we summarize the experimental concept, design, and execution for real-time observation of transcription in living cells.

Title: Evaluation of a simple and cost effective filter paper-based shipping and storage medium for environmental sampling of F-RNA coliphages.
Abstract: Male specific RNA (F-RNA) coliphages are used as indicators of fecal contamination and for source tracking. However, collecting fecal samples for analysis from remote sites is problematic due to the need for an uninterrupted cold chain to guarantee sample suitability for downstream molecular detection of these coliphages. Here, we investigated the feasibility of using filter paper as a collection and storage vehicle for F-RNA coliphages. Various concentrations (10(1) to 10(4)pfu) of two F-RNA coliphages, MS2 and Qβ, were prepared in lambda buffer or a 10% bovine manure slurry, spotted onto filter paper disks, dried, and maintained at 37 °C for up to 37 days. Nucleic acids were extracted from the spotted filter paper disks at 0, 6, 13, and 37 days post inoculation and analyzed by real time RT-PCR. F-RNA coliphages at concentrations of 10(2)pfu/filter paper unit were readily detected, and only a slight decrease in nucleic acid detection was observed over time. Furthermore, the sensitivity of real time RT-PCR detection of the F-RNA coliphage RNA was similar between the developed filter paper sampling methodology and traditional cold storage. These results indicate that filter paper is a suitable storage and transport medium for F-RNA coliphages when refrigeration is not possible.

Title: Investigating norovirus removal by microfiltration, ultrafiltration, and precoagulation-microfiltration processes using recombinant norovirus virus-like particles and real-time immuno-PCR.
Abstract: The removal of microorganisms by drinking water treatment processes has been widely investigated in laboratory-scale experiments using artificially propagated microorganisms. However, this approach cannot be applied to norovirus removal, because this virus does not grow in cell or organ culture, and this fact has hampered our ability to investigate its behavior during drinking water treatment. To overcome this difficulty, our research group previously used recombinant norovirus virus-like particles (rNV-VLPs), which consist of an artificially expressed norovirus capsid protein, in laboratory-scale drinking water treatment experiments. However, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method generally used to detect rNV-VLPs is not sensitive enough to evaluate high removal ratios such as those obtained by ultrafiltration (UF). We therefore developed and applied a real-time immuno-polymerase chain reaction (iPCR) assay for rNV-VLP quantification to investigate norovirus removal by microfiltration (MF), UF, and hybrid precoagulation-MF processes. The rNV-VLP detection limit with the developed iPCR assay was improved at least 1000-fold compared with ELISA. Whereas MF with a nominal pore size of 0.1 μm could not eliminate NV-VLPs, a 4-log reduction was achieved by UF with a molecular weight cutoff of 1 kDa. When MF was combined with precoagulation (≥10 μmol-Fe/L for ferric chloride; ≥20 μmol-Al/L for polyaluminum chloride; ≥40 μmol-Al/L for alum), the performance of the hybrid process in eliminating rNV-VLPs was greater than that achieved by the 1 kDa UF. For all processes, the removal ratios of the bacteriophages MS2 and Qβ were greater than the rNV-VLP removal ratios by 1-2 logs, so neither bacteriophage can be recommended as a possible conservative surrogate for predicting the behavior of native NV during these processes.

Title: Norovirus and MS2 inactivation kinetics of UV-A and UV-B with and without TiO2.
Abstract: Germicidal ultraviolet, such as 254-nm UV-C, is a common method of disinfection of pathogenic enteric viruses. However, the disinfection efficacies of UV-A or -B in terms of inactivating waterborne viruses such as norovirus have not been characterized. We evaluated the inactivation kinetics of MS2 bacteriophage and murine norovirus (MNV), a surrogate of human norovirus (NoV), by UV-A and -B. In addition to UV disinfection, we further investigated whether the presence of TiO2 could enhance the virus inactivation kinetics of UV-A and -B. Both MS2 and MNV were highly resistant to UV-A. However, the addition of TiO2 enhanced the efficacy of UV-A for inactivating these viruses. UV-A dose of 1379 mJ/cm(2) resulted in a 4 log10 reduction. In comparison, UV-B alone effectively inactivated both MS2 and MNV, as evidenced by the 4 log10 reduction by 367 mJ/cm(2) of UV-B. The addition of TiO2 increased the inactivation of MS2; however, it did not significantly increase the efficacy of UV-B disinfection for inactivating MNV. When these treatments were applied to field water such as groundwater, the results were generally consistent with the laboratory findings. Our results clearly indicated that UV-B is useful for the disinfection of waterborne norovirus. However, MNV was quite resistant to UV-A, and UV-A effectively inactivated the tested viruses only when used in combination with TiO2.

Title: Roles of singlet oxygen and triplet excited state of dissolved organic matter formed by different organic matters in bacteriophage MS2 inactivation.
Abstract: Inactivation of bacteriophage MS2 by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and triplet excited state of dissolved organic matter ((3)DOM*) produced by irradiation of natural and synthetic sensitizers with simulated sunlight of wavelengths greater than 320 nm was investigated. Natural sensitizers included purified DOM isolates obtained from wastewater and river waters, and water samples collected from Singapore River, Stamford Canal, and Marina Bay Reservoir in Singapore. Linear correlations were found between MS2 inactivation rate constants (kobs) and the photo-induced reaction rate constants of 2,4,6-trimethylphenol (TMP), a probe compound shown to react mainly with (3)DOM*. Linear correlations between MS2 kobs and singlet oxygen ((1)O2) concentrations were also found for both purified DOM isolates and natural water samples. These correlations, along with data from quenching experiments and experiments with synthetic sensitizers, Rose Bengal (RB), 3'-methoxyacetophenone (3'-MAP), and nitrite [Formula: see text] , suggest that (1)O2, (3)DOM*, and hydroxyl radicals ((•)OH) could inactivate bacteriophage MS2. Linear correlations between MS2 kobs and Specific Ultraviolet Absorption determined at 254 nm (SUVA254) were also found for both purified DOM isolates and natural samples. These results suggest the potential use of TMP as a chemical probe and SUVA254 as an indicator for virus inactivation in natural and purified DOM water samples.

Title: Microorganism inactivation by an ozonation step optimized for micropollutant removal from tertiary effluent.
Abstract: This paper demonstrates the additional benefit of the microbicidal efficacy of an ozonation plant implemented for micropollutant removal from tertiary effluent. Due to the low amount of viruses and protozoa in the tertiary effluent, bacteriophage MS2 and spores of Bacillus subtilis were dosed as surrogates. At specific ozone consumptions of 0.6 and 0.9 g O3/g dissolved organic carbon (DOC) a 2-log colony forming unit (CFU) reduction was achieved for indigenous Escherichia coli and enterococci, and the limits of the European bathing water directive for the excellent quality of inland waters were met. Higher removal was impeded by the shielding effect of suspended solids in the effluent, which implies the combination of ozonation with a preceding filtration step if higher microbicidal performances are required. The surrogate virus MS2 was reduced by 4-5 log while no significant inactivation was detected for B. subtilis spores. Additionally, the impact of ozonation on the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) was studied. The BOD5 measurement was not adversely affected despite the reduced concentration of microorganisms after ozonation. The intrinsic increase in BOD5 averaged 15% at 0.6-0.7 g O3/g DOC. The impact of the projected increase on the surface water quality is generally not considered a problem but has to be assessed on a case-by-case approach.

Title: Yeast-expressed bacteriophage-like particles for the packaging of nanomaterials.
Abstract: Virus-like particles (VLPs) generated by heterologous expression of viral structural genes have become powerful tools in vaccine development. Recently, we and others have reported on the assembly of VLPs of the RNA bacteriophages MS2, Qβ, and GA in yeast. Here, we investigate the formation of VLPs of five additional phages in the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris, namely, the coliphages SP and fr, Acinetobacter phage AP205, Pseudomonas phage PP7, and Caulobacter phage φCb5. In all cases except SP, particle formation was detected, although VLP outcome varied from 0.2 to 8 mg from 1 g of wet cells. We have found that phage φCb5 VLPs easily dissociate into coat protein dimers when applied to strong anion exchangers. Upon salt removal and the addition of nucleic acid or its mimics and calcium ions, the dimers re-assemble into VLPs with high efficiency. A variety of compounds, including RNA, DNA, and gold nanoparticles can be packaged inside φCb5 VLPs. The ease with which phage φCb5 coat protein dimers can be purified in high quantities and re-assembled into VLPs makes them attractive for downstream applications including the internal packaging of nanomaterials and the chemical coupling of peptides of interest on the surface.

Title: The asymmetric structure of an icosahedral virus bound to its receptor suggests a mechanism for genome release.
Abstract: Simple, spherical RNA viruses have well-understood, symmetric protein capsids, but little structural information is available for their asymmetric components, such as minor proteins and their genomes, which are vital for infection. Here, we report an asymmetric structure of bacteriophage MS2, attached to its receptor, the F-pilus. Cryo-electron tomography and subtomographic averaging of such complexes result in a structure containing clear density for the packaged genome, implying that the conformation of the genome is the same in each virus particle. The data also suggest that the single-copy viral maturation protein breaks the symmetry of the capsid, occupying a position that would be filled by a coat protein dimer in an icosahedral shell. This capsomere can thus fulfill its known biological roles in receptor and genome binding and suggests an exit route for the genome during infection.

Title: Packaging signals in two single-stranded RNA viruses imply a conserved assembly mechanism and geometry of the packaged genome.
Abstract: The current paradigm for assembly of single-stranded RNA viruses is based on a mechanism involving non-sequence-specific packaging of genomic RNA driven by electrostatic interactions. Recent experiments, however, provide compelling evidence for sequence specificity in this process both in vitro and in vivo. The existence of multiple RNA packaging signals (PSs) within viral genomes has been proposed, which facilitates assembly by binding coat proteins in such a way that they promote the protein-protein contacts needed to build the capsid. The binding energy from these interactions enables the confinement or compaction of the genomic RNAs. Identifying the nature of such PSs is crucial for a full understanding of assembly, which is an as yet untapped potential drug target for this important class of pathogens. Here, for two related bacterial viruses, we determine the sequences and locations of their PSs using Hamiltonian paths, a concept from graph theory, in combination with bioinformatics and structural studies. Their PSs have a common secondary structure motif but distinct consensus sequences and positions within the respective genomes. Despite these differences, the distributions of PSs in both viruses imply defined conformations for the packaged RNA genomes in contact with the protein shell in the capsid, consistent with a recent asymmetric structure determination of the MS2 virion. The PS distributions identified moreover imply a preferred, evolutionarily conserved assembly pathway with respect to the RNA sequence with potentially profound implications for other single-stranded RNA viruses known to have RNA PSs, including many animal and human pathogens.

Title: Effect of gamma irradiation on bacteriophages used as viral indicators.
Abstract: This study aimed to examine the susceptibility of indicator bacteriophages towards γ-radiation to evaluate their appropriateness as viral indicators for water quality control. The effects of γ-radiation on naturally occurring somatic coliphages, F-specific coliphages and Escherichia coli were examined in raw sewage and sewage sludge. As well, the effects of radiation on bacteriophages ΦX174 and MS2, and E. coli all grown in the laboratory and seeded in distilled water, autoclaved raw sewage and a 1% peptone solution were evaluated. The inactivation of E. coli was fairly similar in all matrices. In contrast, inactivation of bacteriophages was significantly greater in distilled water than in the other matrices. These results showed the great influence of the matrix characteristics on virus inactivation. Somatic coliphages in raw sewage and sewage sludge and ΦX174 in autoclaved sewage were inactivated similarly and were far more resistant than F-specific coliphages, MS2 and E. coli. As well, F-specific RNA bacteriophages in raw sewage and sewage sludge and MS2 in autoclaved sewage were inactivated similarly and were more resistant than E. coli. In contrast, MS2 was more susceptible to γ-radiation than E. coli in distilled water. Our results showed that ΦX174 is a suitable indicator for estimating virus inactivation by γ-irradiation and corroborate the use of somatic coliphages to survey the viral quality of treated water and sludges.

Title: Virus inactivation on hard surfaces or in suspension by chemical disinfectants: systematic review and meta-analysis of norovirus surrogates.
Abstract: Norovirus (NoV) infections are the leading cause of foodborne illness in the United States. Effective disinfection is important for controlling outbreaks caused by this highly infectious virus but can be difficult to achieve because NoV is very resistant to many common disinfection protocols. The inability of human NoV to replicate in tissue culture complicates NoV research, generally necessitating genome copy quantification, the use of surrogate viruses, or the use of other substitutes such as virus-like particles. To date, comprehensive comparisons among NoV surrogates and between surrogates and human NoV are missing, and it is not clear how best to extrapolate information from surrogate data. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of comparisons of NoV surrogates with regard to their susceptibility to disinfection on hard surfaces or in suspension. Restricting our analysis to those studies in which two or more virus surrogates were compared allowed us to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in our analysis, similar to the epidemiological concept of matching. Using meta-analysis methods, our results indicate that hepatitis A virus, murine norovirus 1, and phage MS2 are significantly more resistant to disinfection than is feline calicivirus, but average differences in viral titer reduction appeared to be modest, 1.5 log PFU or less in all cases. None of the studies that compared surrogates and human NoV met our inclusion criteria, precluding a direct comparison between human NoV and NoV surrogates in this study. For all surrogates with sufficient data available to permit subgroup analyses, we detected strong evidence that the type of disinfectant impacted the relative susceptibility of the surrogates. Therefore, extrapolation of results between surrogates or from surrogates to human NoV must consider the type of disinfectant studied.

Title: Laboratory validation of an ozone device for recreational water treatment.
Abstract: Obtaining an accurate assessment of a treatment system's antimicrobial efficacy in recreational water is difficult given the large scale and high flow rates of the water systems. A laboratory test system was designed to mimic the water conditions and potential microbial contaminants found in swimming pools. This system was utilized to evaluate the performance of an in situ ozone disinfection device against four microorganisms: Cryptosporidium parvum, bacteriophage MS2, Enterococcus faecium, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The sampling regimen evaluated the antimicrobial effectiveness in a single pass fashion, with samples being evaluated initially after exposure to the ozone unit, as well as at points downstream from the device. Based on the flow dynamics and log reductions, cycle threshold (Ct) values were calculated. The observed organism log reductions were as follows: >6.7 log for E. faecium and P. aeruginosa; >5.9 log for bacteriophage MS2; and between 2.7 and 4.1 log for C. parvum. The efficacy results indicate that the test system effectively functions as a secondary disinfection system as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Model Aquatic Health Code.

Title: Reduction of bacteriophage MS2 by filtration and irradiation determined by culture and quantitative real-time RT-PCR.
Abstract: Molecular methods are increasingly applied for virus detection in environmental samples without rendering data on viral infectivity. Infectivity data are important for assessing public health risks from exposure to human pathogenic viruses in the environment. Here, treatment efficiencies of three (drinking) water treatment processes were estimated by quantification of the indicator virus bacteriophage MS2 with culture and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). We studied the virus reduction by slow sand filtration at a pilot plant. No decay of MS2 RNA was observed, whereas infectious MS2 particles were inactivated at a rate of 0.1 day(-1). Removal of MS2 RNA and infectious MS2 particles was 1.2 and 1.6 log10-units, respectively. Virus reduction by UV and gamma irradiation was determined in laboratory-scale experiments. The reduction of MS2 RNA based on qRT-PCR data was negligible. Reduction of infectious MS2 particles was estimated at 3.0-3.6 log10-units (UV dose up to 400 or 800 J/m(2)) and 4.7-7 log10-units (gamma dose up to 200 Gray). As shown in this study, estimations of viral reduction, both inactivation and removal, obtained by molecular methods should be interpreted carefully when considering treatment options to provide virus-safe drinking water. Combining culture-based methods with molecular methods may provide supplementary information on mechanisms of virus reduction.

Title: Virus removal and inactivation by iron (hydr)oxide-mediated Fenton-like processes under sunlight and in the dark.
Abstract: Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have emerged as a promising alternative to conventional disinfection methods to control microbial water quality, yet little is known about the fate of viruses in AOPs. In this study, we investigated the fate of MS2 coliphage in AOPs that rely on heterogeneous Fenton-like processes catalyzed by iron (hydr)oxide particles. Both physical removal of viruses from solution via adsorption onto particles as well as true inactivation were considered. Virus fate was studied in batch reactors at circumneutral pH, containing 200 mg L(-1) of four different commercial iron (hydr)oxide particles of similar mesh sizes: hematite (α-Fe2O3), goethite (α-FeOOH), magnetite (Fe3O4) and amorphous iron(iii) hydroxide (Fe(OH)3). The effect of adsorption and sunlight exposure on the survival of MS2 was considered. On a mass basis, all particles exhibited a similar virus adsorption capacity, whereas the rate of adsorption followed the order FeOOH > Fe2O3 > Fe3O4 ≈ Fe(OH)3. This adsorption behavior could not be explained by electrostatic considerations; instead, adsorption must be governed by other factors, such as hydrophobic interactions or van der Waals forces. Adsorption to three of the particles investigated (α-FeOOH, Fe3O4, Fe(OH)3) caused virus inactivation of 7%, 22%, and 14%, respectively. Exposure of particle-adsorbed viruses to sunlight and H2O2 resulted in efficient additional inactivation, whereas inactivation was negligible for suspended viruses. The observed first-order inactivation rate constants were 6.6 × 10(-2), 8.7 × 10(-2), 0.55 and 1.5 min(-1) for α-FeOOH, α-Fe2O3, Fe3O4 and Fe(OH)3 respectively. In the absence of sunlight or H2O2, no inactivation was observed beyond that caused by adsorption alone, except for Fe3O4, which caused virus inactivation via a dark Fenton-like process. Overall our results demonstrate that heterogeneous Fenton-like processes can both physically remove viruses from water as well as inactivate them via adsorption and via a particle-mediated (photo-)Fenton-like process.

Title: Effect of temperature and sunlight on the stability of human adenoviruses and MS2 as fecal contaminants on fresh produce surfaces.
Abstract: Determining the stability, or persistence in an infectious state, of foodborne viral pathogens attached to surfaces of soft fruits and salad vegetables is essential to underpin risk assessment studies in food safety. Here, we evaluate the effect of temperature and sunlight on the stability of infectious human adenoviruses type 2 and MS2 bacteriophages on lettuce and strawberry surfaces as representative fresh products. Human adenoviruses have been selected because of their double role as viral pathogens and viral indicators of human fecal contamination. Stability assays were performed with artificially contaminated fresh samples kept in the dark or under sunlight exposure at 4 and 30°C over 24h. The results indicate that temperature is the major factor affecting HAdV stability in fresh produce surfaces, effecting decay between 3 and 4 log after 24h at 30°C. The inactivation times to achieve a reduction between 1 and 4-log are calculated for each experimental condition. This work provides useful information to be considered for improving food safety regarding the transmission of foodborne viruses through supply chains.

Title: Impact of Sodium Chloride, Sucrose and Milk on Heat Stability of the Murine Norovirus and the MS2 Phage.
Abstract: Until now, little is known about the influence of food additives on heat inactivation of noroviruses. Only a few studies have shown a protective or inhibiting effect on virus infectivity caused by the food matrix. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the influence of sodium chloride, sucrose and milk on heat stability of the surrogates murine norovirus (MNV) and MS2 phage at 60 °C for 1-5 min in PBS for MNV and for 5-120 min in suspension medium buffer for MS2 phage. Different concentrations of sodium chloride (5, 10 %) and sucrose (5, 50 %) were added to the respective buffers. In addition, commercially available milk with different fat concentrations (0.3, 1.5, 3.5 %) was investigated in this study. In general, a linear titre reduction for MNV and MS2 phage could be observed, except for the heat treatment of MNV in PBS with 50 % sucrose. A protective effect of PBS with 50 % sucrose and of the matrix milk on MNV could be concluded. All other tested conditions did not show any influence on virus inactivation. However, MS2 phage did show a higher heat resistance throughout the experiments compared to MNV. In future investigations, it should be tested, whether the achieved data may be considered in risk assessments of heat-treated food products with high concentrations of sugar. Furthermore, it should be clarified, whether these results can also be referred to complex food matrices.

Title: Single domain antibody-alkaline phosphatase fusion proteins for antigen detection--analysis of affinity and thermal stability of single domain antibody.
Abstract: Single domain antibody (sdAb)-alkaline phosphatase (AP) fusion proteins have been demonstrated to be useful immunodiagnostic reagents for bio-threat agent detection. The bivalent nature of sdAb-AP fusion proteins significantly increases effective affinity and thus the sensitivity of detection, but the thermal stability of the fusion protein had not been explored. This property is critical for the development of immunoassays for use in austere environments. In this study four sdAbs with specificity for MS2 phage coat protein (CP) were expressed as fusions with AP in order to evaluate the thermal stability and affinity of the resulting constructs. The melting temperature (Tm) of the sdAb and sdAb-AP fusion proteins was measured by a combination of Circular Dichroism (CD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fluorescence-based Thermal Shift assay. Binding kinetics were assessed using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Our results indicated that the AP fusion protein did not increase the Tm or enhance thermal stability of the sdAb, but did provide the expected increase in binding affinity as compared to the original sdAb.

Title: Sweep flocculation and adsorption of viruses on aluminum flocs during electrochemical treatment prior to surface water microfiltration.
Abstract: Bench-scale experiments were performed to evaluate virus control by an integrated electrochemical-microfiltration (MF) process from turbid (15 NTU) surface water containing moderate amounts of dissolved organic carbon (DOC, 5 mg C/L) and calcium hardness (50 mg/L as CaCO3). Higher reductions in MS2 bacteriophage concentrations were obtained by aluminum electrocoagulation and electroflotation compared with conventional aluminum sulfate coagulation. This was attributed to electrophoretic migration of viruses, which increased their concentrations in the microenvironment of the sacrificial anode where coagulant precursors are dissolved leading to better destabilization during electrolysis. In all cases, viruses were not inactivated implying measured reductions were solely due to their removal. Sweep flocculation was the primary virus destabilization mechanism. Direct evidence for virus enmeshment in flocs was provided by two independent methods: quantitative elution using beef extract at elevated pH and quantitating fluorescence from labeled viruses. Atomic force microscopy studies revealed a monotonically increasing adhesion force between viruses immobilized on AFM tips and floc surfaces with electrocoagulant dosage, which suggests secondary contributions to virus uptake on flocs from adsorption. Virus sorption mechanisms include charge neutralization and hydrophobic interactions with natural organic matter removed during coagulation. This also provided the basis for interpreting additional removal of viruses by the thick cake formed on the surface of the microfilter following electrocoagulation. Enhancements in virus removal as progressively more aluminum was electrolyzed therefore embodies contributions from (i) better encapsulation onto greater amounts of fresh Al(OH)3 precipitates, (ii) increased adsorption capacity associated with higher available coagulant surface area, (iii) greater virus-floc binding affinity due to effective charge neutralization and hydrophobic interactions, and/or (iv) additional removal by a dynamic membrane if a thick cake layer of flocs is deposited.

Title: Subtle differences in virus composition affect disinfection kinetics and mechanisms.
Abstract: Viral disinfection kinetics have been studied in depth, but the molecular-level inactivation mechanisms are not understood. Consequently, it is difficult to predict the disinfection behavior of nonculturable viruses, even when related, culturable viruses are available. The objective of this work was to determine how small differences in the composition of the viral genome and proteins impact disinfection. To this end, we investigated the inactivation of three related bacteriophages (MS2, fr, and GA) by UV254, singlet oxygen ((1)O2), free chlorine (FC), and chlorine dioxide (ClO2). Genome damage was quantified by PCR, and protein damage was assessed by quantitative matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry. ClO2 caused great variability in the inactivation kinetics between viruses and was the only treatment that did not induce genome damage. The inactivation kinetics were similar for all viruses when treated with disinfectants possessing a genome-damaging component (FC, (1)O2, and UV254). On the protein level, UV254 subtly damaged MS2 and fr capsid proteins, whereas GA's capsid remained intact. (1)O2 oxidized a methionine residue in MS2 but did not affect the other two viruses. In contrast, FC and ClO2 rapidly degraded the capsid proteins of all three viruses. Protein composition alone could not explain the observed degradation trends; instead, molecular dynamics simulations indicated that degradation is dictated by the solvent-accessible surface area of individual amino acids. Finally, despite the similarities of the three viruses investigated, their mode of inactivation by a single disinfectant varied. This explains why closely related viruses can exhibit drastically different inactivation kinetics.

Title: Inactivation of bacteriophages by high levels of dissolved CO2.
Abstract: We developed a system with high levels of dissolved CO2 for water disinfection. Bacteriophages MS2, Qbeta and phiX174 were selected as the inactivation targets. A relatively mild inactivation effect was observed on MS2 and Qbeta at different initial concentrations of dissolved CO2 at 0.3 MPa in 20-30 min. When the pressure was increased to 0.6 MPa, the inactivation of MS2 and Qbeta was differentially improved. However, this system was less effective for the inactivation of phiX174. The capsid surface property is a probable reason for the low inactivation of phiX174. The pH was not a key factor in the inactivation of bacteriophages; moreover, the results obtained using alternative gases (pressurized air and O2) indicated that only CO2 inactivated these bacteriophages. A comparison between the results of real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and plaque assay showed that some RNA moved out from the capsid after treatment. Capsid damage by CO2 expansion was the likely mechanism of inactivation with our method.

Title: Uncertainty analysis of the recovery of hollow-fiber ultrafiltration for multiple microbe classes from water: a Bayesian approach.
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a Bayesian approach to address uncertainty of microbial recoveries from hollow-fiber ultrafilters (HFUF) and to determine any sources of uncertainty. Microbial recoveries were measured under twenty conditions, including two types of water, two types of ultrafilters, and five types of microorganisms. The probability distributions of the recoveries were approximated using Bayesian statistics with Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling after integrating the likelihood function of the recovery data and prior information about the data. Then a variance-decomposition method was used for examining influential factors on microbial recovery by HFUF. The results revealed that HFUF efficiently recovered Escherichia coli KO11, E. coli O157:H7 and bacteriophage MS2, but recoveries for Bacillus atrophaeus spores and adenovirus 41 were markedly different between source and treated waters. The uncertainty analysis indicated that the probability distributions for recoveries had dissimilar patterns under different conditions. Among these test factors, the type of microorganisms and associated interaction effects had great impacts on the recovery. To sum up, the Bayesian approach to uncertainty analysis shows advantages in evaluating the recovery of HFUF by providing its full probability distribution.

Title: PRR1 coat protein binding to its RNA translational operator.
Abstract: In small RNA bacteriophages, the genomic RNA binds to the coat proteins when the viral capsid assembles. This is achieved through sequence-specific interactions between a coat-protein dimer and an RNA stem-loop that includes the start codon for the replicase gene. The structure of virus-like particles of the small RNA phage PRR1 bound to an RNA segment corresponding to this stem-loop has been solved and the binding was compared with the related, and better investigated, phage MS2. The overall conformation of the RNA is found to be similar and the residues that are involved in RNA binding in PRR1 are the same as in MS2. The arrangement of the nucleotide bases in the loop of the stem-loop is different, leading to a difference in the stacking at the conserved Tyr86, which is equivalent to Tyr85 in MS2.

Title: Virus inactivation by high frequency ultrasound in combination with visible light.
Abstract: In this study, the effects of high frequency ultrasound (US) and visible light (VL) on virus inactivation were investigated. The bacteriophages ΦX174 and MS2 were used as model viruses. The experiments were performed at room temperature at three different, relatively high US frequencies (i.e., 582, 862, and 1142 kHz) with and without the use of VL, and different initial virus concentrations. The two bacteriophages were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline solution to a titer of 10(3)-10(4)pfu/mL. The experimental virus inactivation data were satisfactorily represented by a simple first-order kinetic expression. Virus inactivation was faster at the lower frequencies (582 and 862 kHz). Furthermore, it was observed that MS2 was inactivated faster than ΦX174. The simultaneous use of US and VL was found to be more effective than US alone for MS2 inactivation, indicating the existence of a synergistic effect. However, the use of VL in conjunction with high frequency US hindered the inactivation of ΦX174.

Title: The role of surface functionalization of colloidal alumina particles on their controlled interactions with viruses.
Abstract: Materials that interact in a controlled manner with viruses attract increasing interest in biotechnology, medicine, and environmental technology. Here, we show that virus-material interactions can be guided by intrinsic material surface chemistries, introduced by tailored surface functionalizations. For this purpose, colloidal alumina particles are surface functionalized with amino, carboxyl, phosphate, chloropropyl, and sulfonate groups in different surface concentrations and characterized in terms of elemental composition, electrokinetic, hydrophobic properties, and morphology. The interaction of the functionalized particles with hepatitis A virus and phages MS2 and PhiX174 is assessed by virus titer reduction after incubation with particles, activity of viruses conjugated to particles, and imaged by electron microscopy. Type and surface density of particle functional groups control the virus titer reduction between 0 and 99.999% (5 log values). For instance, high sulfonate surface concentrations (4.7 groups/nm(2)) inhibit attractive virus-material interactions and lead to complete virus recovery. Low sulfonate surface concentrations (1.2 groups/nm(2)), native alumina, and chloropropyl-functionalized particles induce strong virus-particle adsorption. The virus conformation and capsid amino acid composition further influence the virus-material interaction. Fundamental interrelations between material properties, virus properties, and the complex virus-material interaction are discussed and a versatile pool of surface functionalization strategies controlling virus-material interactions is presented.

Title: A mathematical model for removal of human pathogenic viruses and bacteria by slow sand filtration under variable operational conditions.
Abstract: Slow sand filtration (SSF) in drinking water production removes pathogenic microorganisms, but detection limits and variable operational conditions complicate assessment of removal efficiency. Therefore, a model was developed to predict removal of human pathogenic viruses and bacteria as a function of the operational conditions. Pilot plant experiments were conducted, in which bacteriophage MS2 and Escherichia coli WR1 were seeded as model microorganisms for pathogenic viruses and bacteria onto the filters under various temperatures, flow rates, grain sizes and ages of the Schmutzdecke. Removal of MS2 was 0.082-3.3 log10 and that of E. coli WR1 0.94-4.5 log10 by attachment to the sand grains and additionally by processes in the Schmutzdecke. The contribution of the Schmutzdecke to the removal of MS2 and E. coli WR1 increased with its ageing, with sticking efficiency and temperature, decreased with grain size, and was modelled as a logistic growth function with scale factor f0 and rate coefficient f1. Sticking efficiencies were found to be microorganism and filter specific, but the values of f0 and f1 were independent of microorganism and filter. Cross-validation showed that the model can be used to predict log removal of MS2 and ECWR1 within ±0.6 log. Within the range of operational conditions, the model shows that removal of microorganisms is most sensitive to changes in temperature and age of the Schmutzdecke.

Title: Antiviral effect of cationic compounds on bacteriophages.
Abstract: The antiviral activity of several cationic compounds - cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), chitosan, nisin, and lysozyme - was investigated on the bacteriophage c2 (DNA head and non-contractile tail) infecting Lactococcus strains and the bacteriophage MS2 (F-specific RNA) infecting E. coli. Firstly, these activities were evaluated in a phosphate buffer pH 7 - 10 mM. The CTAB had a virucidal effect on the Lactococcus bacteriophages, but not on the MS2. After 1 min of contact with 0.125 mM CTAB, the c2 population was reduced from 6 to 1.5 log(pfu)/mL and completely deactivated at 1 mM. On the contrary, chitosan inhibited the MS2 more than it did the bacteriophages c2. No antiviral effect was observed for the nisin or the lysozyme on bacteriophages after 1 min of treatment. A 1 and 2.5 log reduction was respectively observed for nisin and lysozyme when the treatment time increased (5 or 10 min). These results showed that the antiviral effect depended both on the virus and structure of the antimicrobial compounds. The antiviral activity of these compounds was also evaluated in different physico-chemical conditions and in complex matrices. The antiviral activity of CTAB was impaired in acid pH and with an increase of the ionic strength. These results might be explained by the electrostatic interactions between cationic compounds and negatively charged particles such as bacteriophages or other compounds in a matrix. Milk proved to be protective suggesting the components of food could interfere with antimicrobial compounds.

Title: Impact of the virus purification protocol on aggregation and electrokinetics of MS2 phages and corresponding virus-like particles.
Abstract: Previous experimental and theoretical studies have established that electrokinetic and aggregation properties of soft MS2 phages are not only governed by the physico-chemical features of their proteinaceous outer surface but are also significantly impacted by those of their inner RNA component (Dika et al. Appl. Environ. Microbiol., 2011, 14, 4939-4948). These conclusions contradict the recent findings of Nguyen et al. (Soft Matter, 2011, 7, 10449-10456) who reported identical electrokinetic and aggregation characteristics for MS2 and corresponding virus like particles (VLPs) that lack the internal RNA component. We demonstrate here that this contradiction originates from the different purification methods adopted prior to measurements. More generally, we show that stability and electrohydrodynamics of viruses differ according to purification by (i) dialysis, (ii) isopycnic centrifugation in the cesium chloride gradient, and (iii) precipitation using polyethylene glycol (PEG). Methods (i) and (iii) lead to aggregation of MS2 phages at pH ≤ 4 and pH ≤ 6 in 1-100 mM NaNO3 solutions, respectively, while under such conditions aggregation is not observed for MS2 and VLP suspensions prepared according to (ii). In addition, VLPs prepared following methods (i) and (iii) aggregate only at the isoelectric point (pH ~ 3-4) in 1 mM NaNO3 solution. Electrophoretic mobility data of stable MS2 and VLP particles were further examined using a recent formalism for electrokinetics of soft multilayered colloids. The analysis qualitatively shows how the purification protocol may affect either the outer particle surface properties and/or the inner particle content. Finally, the non-DLVO aggregation behavior of MS2 and VLPs purified via the above protocols is discussed in terms of the possible change in corresponding interparticular interactions.

Title: Comparative analysis of rodent tissue preservation methods and nucleic acid extraction techniques for virus screening purposes.
Abstract: The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has become an essential method for the detection of viruses in tissue specimens. However, it is well known that the presence of PCR inhibitors in tissue samples may cause false-negative results. Hence the identification of PCR inhibitors and evaluation and optimization of nucleic acid extraction and preservation methods is of prime concern in virus discovery programs dealing with animal tissues. Accordingly, to monitor and remove inhibitors we have performed comparative analyses of two commonly used tissue storage methods and five RNA purification techniques using a variety of animal tissues, containing quantified levels of added MS2 bacteriophages as the indicator of inhibition. The results showed (i) no significant difference between the two methods of sample preservation, viz. direct storage at -80°C or 4°C in RNAlater, (ii) lung rodent tissues contained lower levels of inhibitor than liver, kidney and spleen, (iii) RNA extraction using the EZ1+PK RNA kit was the most effective procedure for removal of RT-PCR inhibitors.

Title: Impact of milk components on recovery of viral RNA from MS2 bacteriophage.
Abstract: Noroviruses are responsible for approximately 44 % of outbreaks involving dairy products for which causative agents are reported. Recovery of viruses from milk and dairy products is a difficult task. The role of different components of milk in the recovery of viral RNA was evaluated in this study. Four model milk formulations (A-D) were prepared by mixing different combinations of lactose, whey protein, casein, and fat in water. Each model formulation was spiked with five concentrations of bacteriophage MS2. The phenol-guanidine thiocyanate-chloroform protocol was used for extracting viral RNA from the model milk formulations and then extracted RNA was measured by a nanodrop spectrophotometer in ng/μl. The results showed that casein and whey protein had the highest negative impact on RNA yield, especially when the number of MS2 was less than 1.3 pfu/ml. The highest RNA recovery was obtained from the model milk formulation containing all four components; lactose, whey protein, casein, and fat. The amount of extracted RNA was closely correlated with the dry matter content of each formulation and the spiked concentration of coliphage using response surface modeling (R²:0.93). It was determined that milk fat is the most effective component in facilitating RNA extraction and the highest RNA yield can be achieved via elimination of whey protein and casein from milk by centrifugation at 40,000×g for 60 min. To achieve the highest viral RNA recovery efficiency by the proposed method, milk fat must be recombined with the supernatant of the centrifuged sample and then homogenized before performing the extraction protocol.

Title: Assessment of a portable handheld UV light device for the disinfection of viruses and bacteria in water.
Abstract: Effective individual microbiological water purifiers are needed for consumption of untreated water sources by campers, emergency use, military, and in developing counties. A handheld UV light device was tested to assess if it could meet the virus reduction requirements established by the United State Environmental Protection Agency, National Science Foundation and the World Health Organization. The device was found capable of inactivating at least 4 log₁₀ of poliovirus type 1, rotavirus SA-11 and MS-2 virus in 500 mL volumes of general case test water. But in the presence of high turbidity and organic matter, filtration was necessary to achieve a 4 log₁₀ reduction of the test viruses.

Title: Controlled integration of gold nanoparticles and organic fluorophores using synthetically modified MS2 viral capsids.
Abstract: The placement of fluorophores in close proximity to metal nanoparticle surfaces is proposed to enhance several photophysical properties of the dyes, potentially leading to improved quantum yields and decreased photobleaching. It is difficult in practice, however, to establish and maintain the nanoscale distances that are required to maximize these effects. The type of metal, size, and shape of the nanoparticle, the physical distance separating the metal nanoparticle from the organic dye, and the spectral properties of the fluorophore itself are all proposed to influence the quantum yield and lifetime. This results in a complex behavior that can lead to either enhanced or quenched fluorescence in different contexts. In this report, we describe a well-defined system that can be used to explore these effects, while physically preventing the fluorophores from contacting the nanoparticle surfaces. The basis of this system is the spherical protein capsid of bacteriophage MS2, which was used to house gold particles within its interior volume. The exterior surface of each capsid was then modified with Alexa Fluor 488 (AF 488) labeled DNA strands. By placing AF 488 dyes at distances of 3, 12, and 24 bp from the surface of capsids containing 10 nm gold nanoparticles, fluorescence intensity enhancements of 2.2, 1.2, and 1.0 were observed, respectively. A corresponding decrease in fluorescence lifetime was observed for each distance. Because of its well-defined and modular nature, this architecture allows the rapid exploration of the many variables involved in metal-controlled fluorescence, leading to a better understanding of this phenomenon.

Title: Changes in fluorescence spectra of bioaerosols exposed to ozone in a laboratory reaction chamber to simulate atmospheric aging.
Abstract: A laboratory system for exposing aerosol particles to ozone and rapidly measuring the subsequent changes in their single-particle fluorescence is reported. The system consists of a rotating drum chamber and a single-particle fluorescence spectrometer (SPFS) utilizing excitation at 263 nm. Measurements made with this system show preliminary results on the ultra-violet laser-induced-fluorescence (UV-LIF) spectra of single aerosolized particles of Yersinia rohdei, and of MS2 (bacteriophage) exposed to ozone. When bioparticles are exposed in the chamber the fluorescence emission peak around 330 nm: i) decreases in intensity relative to that of the 400-550 nm band; and ii) shifts slightly toward shorter-wavelengths (consistent with further drying of the particles). In these experiments, changes were observed at exposures below the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) limits for ozone.

Title: Sunlight inactivation of human viruses and bacteriophages in coastal waters containing natural photosensitizers.
Abstract: Sunlight inactivation of poliovirus type 3 (PV3), adenovirus type 2 (HAdV2), and two bacteriophage (MS2 and PRD1) was investigated in an array of coastal waters to better understand solar inactivation mechanisms and the effect of natural water constituents on observed inactivation rates (k(obs)). Reactor scale inactivation experiments were conducted using a solar simulator, and k(obs) for each virus was measured in a sensitizer-free control and five unfiltered surface water samples collected from different sources. k(obs) values varied between viruses in the same water matrix, and for each virus in different matrices, with PV3 having the fastest and MS2 the slowest k(obs) in all waters. When exposed to full-spectrum sunlight, the presence of photosensitizers increased k(obs) of HAdV2, PRD1 and MS2, but not PV3, which provides evidence that the exogenous sunlight inactivation mechanism, involving damage by exogenously produced reactive intermediates, played a greater role for these viruses. While PV3 inactivation was observed to be dominated by endogenous mechanisms, this may be due to a masking of exogenous k(obs) by significantly faster endogenous k(obs). Results illustrate that differences in water composition can shift absolute and relative inactivation rates of viruses, which has important implications for natural wastewater treatment systems, solar disinfection (SODIS), and the use of indicator organisms for monitoring water quality.

Title: Virus transport in a discrete fracture.
Abstract: Tracer experiments were carried out in a naturally discrete-fractured chalk core with solute tracers Li(+) and Br(-), and colloidal tracers of two origins-bacteriophages (MS2, ϕX174 and T4) and fluorescent latex microspheres. The colloidal tracers were either ∼20 nm (MS2, ϕX174 and microspheres) or ∼200 nm (T4 and microspheres) in size. Both solute and colloidal tracers were injected at a constant flux at the fracture inlet and collected at the outlet to evaluate the form of their breakthrough curves (BTCs). The BTCs of all tracers were compared and analyzed. The BTC analysis displayed significant differences in recovery as a function of tracer size and type. Even within the same colloid size, transport of the microspheres and bacteriophages was dissimilar, likely due to minor differences in density, surface chemistry and shape. More pronounced peaks and recoveries were observed with ∼200 nm compared to ∼20 nm microspheres and phages. Arrival time at the outlet was also size-dependent, with larger microspheres and phages having longer residence times than smaller ones, and solutes being 5-15 times slower than colloids of both sizes. The observed differences were explained by a combination of size and electrostatic interactions that facilitates entrance and transport within the pores in the chalk matrix. Overall, our results clearly demonstrate that fractures are favorable carriers for viruses of different sizes with different surface properties. The viruses' properties were also shown to govern their transport through the fractures.

Title: Inactivation of pathogens in feces by desiccation and urea treatment for application in urine-diverting dry toilets.
Abstract: Ecological sanitation technologies can be effective in providing health and environmental pollution control if they can efficiently reduce the pathogenicity of microorganisms carried in fecal material to safe levels. This study evaluated the sanitizing effects of different additives for dry treatment of feces from urine-diverting dry toilets, based on inactivation of Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, bacteriophages MS2 and ΦX, and Ascaris suum. The additives, ash (A) and oyster shell (O) in different amounts and urea (U) to optimize the process, were compared with no additive, solely urea, and sawdust as controls (C) and were covered ([x%O:A]) or uncovered (x%O:A). The main inactivation factors found were desiccation, ammonia content, and pH. S. Typhimurium and E. faecalis were more affected by the ammonia content. A combination of neutral to high pH and desiccation was most effective for inactivation of MS2, and desiccation was most effective for inactivation of ΦX and A. suum. The inactivation rate was modeled for all combinations studied. The most promising treatments were [150%O:A+U], 150%O:A+U, and 150%O:A. According to the models, these could inactivate, for example, 7 log(10) units of all bacteria and bacteriophages within 83, 125, and 183 days, respectively. The inactivation of A. suum was modeled, albeit the measured decay in egg viability was low.

Title: Improved virus removal in ceramic depth filters modified with MgO.
Abstract: Ceramic filters, working on the depth filtration principle, are known to improve drinking water quality by removing human pathogenic microorganisms from contaminated water. However, these microfilters show no sufficient barrier for viruses having diameters down to 20 nm. Recently, it was shown that the addition of positively charged materials, for example, iron oxyhydroxide, can improve virus removal by adsorption mechanisms. In this work, we modified a common ceramic filter based on diatomaceous earth by introducing a novel virus adsorbent material, magnesium oxyhydroxide, into the filter matrix. Such filters showed an improved removal of about 4-log in regard to bacteriophages MS2 and PhiX174. This is explained with the electrostatic enhanced adsorption approach that is the favorable adsorption of negatively charged viruses onto positively charged patches in an otherwise negatively charged filter matrix. Furthermore, we provide theoretical evidence applying calculations according to Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek theory to strengthen our experimental results. However, modified filters showed a significant variance in virus removal efficiency over the course of long-term filtration experiments with virus removal increasing with filter operation time (or filter aging). This is explained by transformational changes of MgO in the filter upon contact with water. It also demonstrates that filter history is of great concern when filters working on the adsorption principles are evaluated in regard to their retention performance as their surface characteristics may alter with use.

Title: MS2 VLP-based delivery of microRNA-146a inhibits autoantibody production in lupus-prone mice.
Abstract: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of pathogenic autoantibodies. Recent studies suggest that microRNAs (miRNAs) play an essential role in immunoregulation and may be involved in the pathogenesis of SLE. Therefore, it was of interest to investigate the potential therapeutic application of miRNAs in SLE, a concept that has not been thoroughly investigated thus far. Virus-like particles (VLPs) are a type of recombinant nanoparticle enveloped by certain proteins derived from the outer coat of a virus. Herein, we describe a novel miRNA-delivery approach via bacteriophage MS2 VLPs and investigate the therapeutic effects of miR-146a, a well-studied and SLE-related miRNA, in BXSB lupus-prone mice.

Title: PET Imaging and biodistribution of chemically modified bacteriophage MS2.
Abstract: The fields of nanotechnology and medicine have merged in the development of new imaging and drug delivery agents based on nanoparticle platforms. As one example, a mutant of bacteriophage MS2 can be differentially modified on the exterior and interior surfaces for the concurrent display of targeting functionalities and payloads, respectively. In order to realize their potential for use in in vivo applications, the biodistribution and circulation properties of this class of agents must first be investigated. A means of modulating and potentially improving the characteristics of nanoparticle agents is the appendage of PEG chains. Both MS2 and MS2-PEG capsids possessing interior DOTA chelators were labeled with (64)Cu and injected intravenously into mice possessing tumor xenografts. Dynamic imaging of the agents was performed using PET-CT on a single animal per sample, and the biodistribution at the terminal time point (24 h) was assessed by gamma counting of the organs ex vivo for 3 animals per agent. Compared to other viral capsids of similar size, the MS2 agents showed longer circulation times. Both MS2 and MS2-PEG bacteriophage behaved similarly, although the latter agent showed significantly less uptake in the spleen. This effect may be attributed to the ability of the PEG chains to mask the capsid charge. Although the tumor uptake of the agents may result from the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect, selective tumor imaging may be achieved in the future by using exterior targeting groups.

Title: Persistence of Norwalk virus, male-specific coliphage, and Escherichia coli on stainless steel coupons and in phosphate-buffered saline.
Abstract: Human noroviruses (NoVs) are a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis and are frequently transmitted by contaminated food, water, hands, and environmental surfaces. Little is known about their environmental stability and/or which alternative microorganisms can serve as effective surrogates. To examine whether Escherichia coli and male-specific coliphage MS2 can be appropriate surrogates for NoVs, approximately 6.8 log genomic equivalent copies of Norwalk virus (NV), and 6.0 to 6.5 log PFU or CFU of MS2 and E. coli, respectively, were inoculated onto stainless steel coupons and held at 4°C, room temperature (RT), or 37°C over a period of 75 min (E. coli and MS2) to 4 weeks. These three microorganisms were also seeded into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and sampled at different time intervals for up to 6 weeks. MS2 and E. coli survived approximately 15 min at 37°C, 45 min at RT, and 60 min at 4°C on the stainless steel surfaces. In contrast, NV RNA titers were reduced by only 2.4 log at 37°C, 1.5 log at RT, and 0.9 log at 4°C after 4 weeks. MS2 and E. coli were able to survive at least 5 weeks in PBS at 4°C and RT, and NV was stable in PBS at 4°C and RT for at least 6 weeks. However, E. coli, MS2, and NV were completely inactivated after 1-, 4-, and 5-week incubations in PBS at 37°C, respectively. These findings indicate that NoVs are highly persistent on environmental surfaces and in PBS solution at different temperatures. While E. coli does not appear to be an appropriate surrogate for NoVs, MS2 could be more relevant for modeling the environmental persistence of NoVs under wet conditions, but not under dry conditions.

Title: Evaluation of viral concentration methods from irrigation and processing water.
Abstract: Four viral concentration methods were evaluated for their efficiency in recovering murine norovirus-1 (MNV-1) (surrogate for human noroviruses (NoV)) and MS2 bacteriophages from processing water (1L) and four different types of irrigation water (bore hole water, rain water, open well and river water) (2-5L). Three methods were based on the viral adsorption and elution principle, two methods using an electronegative HA-membrane (Katayama et al., 2002), one method using an electropositive Zetapor membrane according to CEN/TC275/WG6/TAG4 and the fourth method was based on size exclusion using a tangential flow filtration system. Detection of MNV-1 was achieved by real-time RT-PCR and detection of MS2 by double-layer plaque assay. For the recovery of MNV-1, the method using an electronegative HA-filter in combination with an elution buffer earlier optimized by Hamza et al. (2009) (Method 1) performed best for all types of water (recovery: 5.8-21.9%). In case of MS2 detection, the best method depended upon the type of water although Method 1 provided the most consistent recovery. To complete this evaluation, the Method 1 was evaluated further for the concentration of human enteric viruses (GI and GII NoV, hepatitis A virus (HAV) and rotaviruses) in the same five types of water. Although detection of rotaviruses (RV) was somewhat less efficient, Method 1 proved reliable for the detection of NoV and HAV in all water types. Mean recovery efficiencies ranging from 4.8% for detection of GI NoV in open well water to 32.1% for detection of HAV in bore hole water, depending on the water type and the viral pathogen analyzed.

Title: Transport of microbial tracers in clean and organically contaminated silica sand in laboratory columns compared with their transport in the field.
Abstract: Waste disposal on land and the consequent transport of bacterial and viral pathogens in soils and aquifers are of major concern worldwide. Pathogen transport can be enhanced in the presence of organic matter due to occupation of attachment sites in the aquifer materials thus preventing pathogen attachment leading to their faster transport for longer distances. Laboratory column studies were carried out to investigate the effect of organic matter, in the form of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), on the transport of Escherichia coli and MS2 phage in saturated clean silica sand. Transport rates of these microbial tracers were also studied in a contaminated field site. Laboratory column studies showed that low concentrations (0.17 mg L(-1)) of DOC had little effect on E. coli J6-2 removal and slightly reduced the attachment of MS2 phage. After progressive conditioning of the column with DOC (1.7 mg L(-1) and 17 mg L(-1)), neither E. coli J6-2 nor MS2 phage showed any attachment and recovery rates increased dramatically (up to 100%). The results suggest that DOC can affect the transport rates of microbial contaminants. For E. coli J6-2 the predominant effect appeared to be an increase in the secondary energy minimum leading to an increase in E. coli attachment initially. However, after 17 mg L(-1) DOC conditioning of the silica sand no attachment of E. coli was observed as the DOC took up attachment sites in the porous media. MS2 phage appeared to be affected predominantly by out-competition of binding sites in the clean silica sand and a steady reduction in attachment was observed as the DOC conditioning increased. Field study showed a high removal of both E. coli and MS2 phage, although E. coli was removed at a lower rate than MS2 phage. In the field it is likely that a combination of effects are seen as the aquifer material will be heterogeneous in its surface nanoscale properties, demonstrated by the differing removal of E. coli and MS2 phage compared to the laboratory scale experiments. This research demonstrates the importance of combining laboratory scale and field scale studies to fully understand removal of microbes in groundwater aquifers affected by organic matter (DOC).

Title: Synergistic effect of heat and solar UV on DNA damage and water disinfection of E. coli and bacteriophage MS2.
Abstract: The response of a representative virus and indicator bacteria to heating, solar irradiation, or their combination, was investigated in a controlled solar simulator and under real sun conditions. Heating showed higher inactivation of Escherichia coli compared to the bacteriophage MS2. Heating combined with natural or simulated solar irradiation demonstrated a synergistic effect on the inactivation of E. coli, with up to 3-log difference for 50 °C and natural sun insolation of 2,000 kJ m(-2) (compared to the sum of the separate treatments). Similar synergistic effect was also evident when solar-UV induced DNA damage to E. coli was assessed using the endonuclease sensitive site assay (ESS). MS2 was found to be highly resistant to irradiation and heat, with a slightly synergistic effect observed only at 59 °C and natural sun insolation of 5,580 kJ m(-2). Heat treatment also hindered light-dependent recovery of E. coli making the treatment much more effective.

Title: Visualizing and quantifying dose distribution in a UV reactor using three-dimensional laser-induced fluorescence.
Abstract: Evaluating the performance of typical water treatment UV reactors is challenging due to the complexity in assessing spatial and temporal variation of UV fluence, resulting from highly unsteady, turbulent nature of flow and variation in UV intensity. In this study, three-dimensional laser-induced fluorescence (3DLIF) was applied to visualize and quantitatively analyze a lab-scale UV reactor consisting of one lamp sleeve placed perpendicular to flow. Mapping the spatial and temporal fluence delivery and MS2 inactivation revealed the highest local fluence in the wake zone due to longer residence time and higher UV exposure, while the lowest local fluence occurred in a region near the walls due to short-circuiting flow and lower UV fluence rate. Comparing the tracer based decomposition between hydrodynamics and IT revealed similar coherent structures showing the dependency of fluence delivery on the reactor flow. The location of tracer injection, varying the height and upstream distance from the lamp center, was found to significantly affect the UV fluence received by the tracer. A Lagrangian-based analysis was also employed to predict the fluence along specific paths of travel, which agreed with the experiments. The 3DLIF technique developed in this study provides new insight on dose delivery that fluctuates both spatially and temporally and is expected to aid design and optimization of UV reactors as well as validate computational fluid dynamics models that are widely used to simulate UV reactor performances.

Title: Modeling bacteriophage amplification as a predictive tool for optimized MALDI-TOF MS-based bacterial detection.
Abstract: Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is a valuable tool for rapid bacterial detection and identification but is limited by the need for relatively high cell count samples, which have been grown under strictly controlled conditions. These requirements can be eliminated by the natural infection of a viable bacterial species of interest with a host-specific phage. This produces a rapid increase in phage protein concentrations in comparison to bacterial concentrations, which can in turn be exploited as a method for signal amplification during MALDI-TOF MS. One drawback to this approach is the requirement for repetitive, time-consuming sample preparation and analysis applied over the course of a phage infection to monitor phage concentrations as a function of time to determine the MALDI-TOF MS detection limit. To reduce the requirement for repeated preparation and analysis, a modified phage therapy model was investigated as a means for predicting the time during a given phage infection when a detectable signal would occur. The modified model used a series of three differential equations composed of predetermined experimental parameters including phage burst size and burst time to predict progeny phage concentrations as a function of time. Using Yersinia pestis with plague diagnostic phage φA1122 and Escherichia coli with phage MS2 as two separate, well-characterized model phage-host pairs, we conducted in silico modeling of the infection process and compared it with experimental infections monitored in real time by MALDI-TOF MS. Significant agreement between mathematically calculated phage growth curves and those experimentally obtained by MALDI-TOF MS was observed, thus verifying this method's utility for significant time and labor reduction.

Title: Genetic encoding of fluorescent RNA ensures a bright future for visualizing nucleic acid dynamics.
Abstract: Recently RNA localization has been appreciated as an essential post-transcriptional mechanism to program local proteome composition and function. Although RNA has been visualized using diverse techniques, the use of the bacteriophage MS2 method to encode genetically fluorescent RNA has revolutionized the study of RNA dynamics in living cells. Here, I highlight the strength of MS2 compared to other techniques, and how further evolution of this system will enable the visualization of RNA in the context of complex live-cell dynamics. Although the generation of MS2-fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and MS2-bifluorescence complementation (BiFC) will require further development, it has the potential to increase significantly the signal-to-noise ratio, which is the major obstacle to rapid live-cell imaging of RNA.

Title: Survival and inactivation of human norovirus surrogates in blueberry juice by high-pressure homogenization.
Abstract: Human noroviruses (HNoV) have been implicated in gastrointestinal outbreaks associated with fresh produce, juices, and ready-to-eat foods. In order to determine the risk of HNoV transmission by contaminated blueberry juice, survival characteristics of cultivable HNoV surrogates (murine norovirus, MNV-1; feline calicivirus, FCV-F9; and bacteriophage MS2) in blueberry juice (pH = 2.77) after 0, 1, 2, 7, 14, and 21 days at refrigeration temperatures (4°C) were studied. High-pressure homogenization (HPH) was studied as a novel processing method for noroviral surrogate inactivation in blueberry juice. Blueberry juice or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2 as control) was inoculated with each virus, stored over 21 days at 4°C or subjected to HPH, and plaque assayed. FCV-F9 (∼5 log(10) PFU/mL) was undetectable after 1 day in blueberry juice at 4°C. MNV-1 (∼4 log(10) PFU/ml) showed minimal reduction (1 log(10) PFU/mL) after 14 days, with greater reduction (1.95 log(10) PFU/mL; p < 0.05) after 21 days in blueberry juice at 4°C. Bacteriophage MS2 (∼6 log(10) PFU/mL) showed significant reduction (1.93 log(10) PFU/mL; p < 0.05) after 2 days and was undetectable after 7 days in blueberry juice at 4°C. FCV-F9 remained viable in PBS for up to 21 days (2.28 log(10) PFU/mL reduction), while MNV-1 and MS2 survived after 21 days (1.08 and 0.56 log(10) PFU/mL reduction, respectively). Intriguingly, FCV-F9 and bacteriophage MS2 showed reduction after minimal homogenization pressures in blueberry juice (pH = 2.77), possibly due to the combination of juice pH, juice components, and mechanical effects. MNV-1 in blueberry juice was only slightly reduced at 250 (0.33 log(10) PFU/mL) and 300 MPa (0.71 log(10) PFU/mL). Virus surrogate survival in blueberry juice at 4°C correlates well with the ease of HNoV transmission via juices. HPH for viral inactivation in juices is dependent on virus type, and higher homogenization pressures may be needed for MNV-1 inactivation.

Title: MS2 viruslike particles: a robust, semisynthetic targeted drug delivery platform.
Abstract: We show that viruslike particles (VLPs) reassembled in vitro with the RNA bacteriophage MS2 coat protein and an RNA conjugate encompassing a siRNA and a known capsid assembly signal can be targeted to HeLa cells by covalent attachment of human transferrin. The siRNA VLPs protect their cargoes from nuclease, have a double-stranded conformation in the capsid and carry multiple drug and targeting ligands. The relative efficiency of VLP reassembly has been assessed, and conditions have been determined for larger scale production. Targeted VLPs have been purified away from unmodified VLPs for the first time allowing improved analysis of the effects of this synthetic virion system. The particles enter cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis and produce siRNA effects at low nanomolar concentrations. Although less effective than a commercial cationic lipid vector at siRNA delivery, the smaller amounts of internalized RNA with VLP delivery had an effect as good as if not better than the lipid transfection route. This implies that the siRNAs delivered by this route are more accessible to the siRNA pathway than identical RNAs delivered in complex lipid aggregates. The data suggest that the MS2 system continues to show many of the features that will be required to create an effective targeted drug delivery system. The fluorescence assays of siRNA effects described here will facilitate the combinatorial analysis of both future formulations and dosing regimes.

The development of a targeted drug delivery system using MS2 VLPs could be beneficial in overcoming antibiotic resistance.

Title: Survival of murine norovirus and F-RNA coliphage MS2 on pork during storage and retail display.
Abstract: The existence of animal strains of norovirus (NV) that are closely related to human strains raises concerns about interspecies recombination and the potential for zoonotic transmission through undercooked meat products. Contamination of meat with NV can occur both via meat processing operations and poor food handler hygiene. There is a lack of knowledge on the survival of NV on raw meat because NV cannot be effectively cultivated and its detection is limited to molecular methods. The survival of murine norovirus (MNV) and MS2, as surrogates for NV, was determined on pork chops by plaque assay and real time RT-PCR. Both MNV and MS2 displayed very high survival rates on vacuum packaged raw pork chops that were stored at 2°C for up to 7 weeks and numbers declined little during subsequent retail display for 7 days. Maximum reductions for MNV and MS2 were 1.0 log PFU/cm(2) and 0.6 log genome copies(GC)/cm(2) or 1.1 log PFU/cm(2) and 1.2 log GC/cm(2), respectively. The viability of MS2 and MNV was not affected by the proteolytic enzymes present in the meat nor by numbers of bacteria that increased with time during storage in vacuum packs and while on retail display. MNV and MS2 can be considered as good surrogates for NV on raw meat. The findings of this study indicate that potentially pathogenic NV will likely survive extremely well on fresh meat and consumers could potentially be at risk when consuming undercooked meat that is contaminated with NV.

Title: Virus inactivation mechanisms: impact of disinfectants on virus function and structural integrity.
Abstract: Oxidative processes are often harnessed as tools for pathogen disinfection. Although the pathways responsible for bacterial inactivation with various biocides are fairly well understood, virus inactivation mechanisms are often contradictory or equivocal. In this study, we provide a quantitative analysis of the total damage incurred by a model virus (bacteriophage MS2) upon inactivation induced by five common virucidal agents (heat, UV, hypochlorous acid, singlet oxygen, and chlorine dioxide). Each treatment targets one or more virus functions to achieve inactivation: UV, singlet oxygen, and hypochlorous acid treatments generally render the genome nonreplicable, whereas chlorine dioxide and heat inhibit host-cell recognition/binding. Using a combination of quantitative analytical tools, we identified unique patterns of molecular level modifications in the virus proteins or genome that lead to the inhibition of these functions and eventually inactivation. UV and chlorine treatments, for example, cause site-specific capsid protein backbone cleavage that inhibits viral genome injection into the host cell. Combined, these results will aid in developing better methods for combating waterborne and foodborne viral pathogens and further our understanding of the adaptive changes viruses undergo in response to natural and anthropogenic stressors.

Rating: ChatCompletionMessage(content='This abstract provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of inactivation of the MS2 phage by various virucidal agents, shedding light on the specific molecular modifications induced in the virus proteins or genome.

Title: Development of surrogate correlation models to predict trace organic contaminant oxidation and microbial inactivation during ozonation.
Abstract: The performance of ozonation in wastewater depends on water quality and the ability to form hydroxyl radicals (·OH) to meet disinfection or contaminant transformation objectives. Since there are no on-line methods to assess ozone and ·OH exposure in wastewater, many agencies are now embracing indicator frameworks and surrogate monitoring for regulatory compliance. Two of the most promising surrogate parameters for ozone-based treatment of secondary and tertiary wastewater effluents are differential UV(254) absorbance (ΔUV(254)) and total fluorescence (ΔTF). In the current study, empirical correlations for ΔUV(254) and ΔTF were developed for the oxidation of 18 trace organic contaminants (TOrCs), including 1,4-dioxane, atenolol, atrazine, bisphenol A, carbamazepine, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, meprobamate, naproxen, N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), para-chlorobenzoic acid (pCBA), phenytoin, primidone, sulfamethoxazole, triclosan, trimethoprim, and tris-(2-chloroethyl)-phosphate (TCEP) (R(2) = 0.50-0.83) and the inactivation of three microbial surrogates, including Escherichia coli, MS2, and Bacillus subtilis spores (R(2) = 0.46-0.78). Nine wastewaters were tested in laboratory systems, and eight wastewaters were evaluated at pilot- and full-scale. A predictive model for OH exposure based on ΔUV(254) or ΔTF was also proposed.

Title: Microbiological effectiveness of mineral pot filters in Cambodia.
Abstract: Mineral pot filters (MPFs) are household water treatment (HWT) devices that are manufactured and distributed by the private sector, with millions of users in Southeast Asia. Their effectiveness in reducing waterborne microbes has not been previously investigated. We purchased three types of MPFs available on the Cambodian market for systematic evaluation of bacteria, virus, and protozoan surrogate microbial reduction in laboratory challenge experiments following WHO recommended performance testing protocols. Results over the total 1500 L testing period per filter indicate that the devices tested were highly effective in reducing Esherichia coli (99.99%+), moderately effective in reducing bacteriophage MS2 (99%+), and somewhat effective against Bacillus atrophaeus, a spore-forming bacterium we used as a surrogate for protozoa (88%+). Treatment mechanisms for all filters included porous ceramic and activated carbon filtration. Our results suggest that these commercially available filters may be at least as effective against waterborne pathogens as other, locally available treatment options such as ceramic pot filters or boiling. More research is needed on the role these devices may play as interim solutions to the problem of unsafe drinking water in Cambodia and globally.

Title: Inactivation of bacteriophage MS2 with potassium ferrate(VI).
Abstract: Ferrate [Fe(VI); FeO(4)(2-)] is an emerging oxidizing agent capable of controlling chemical and microbial water contaminants. Here, inactivation of MS2 coliphage by Fe(VI) was examined. The inactivation kinetics observed in individual batch experiments was well described by a Chick-Watson model with first-order dependences on disinfectant and infective phage concentrations. The inactivation rate constant k(i) at a Fe(VI) dose of 1.23 mgFe/L (pH 7.0, 25 °C) was 2.27(±0.05) L/(mgFe × min), corresponding to 99.99% inactivation at a Ct of ~4 (mgFe × min)/L. Measured k(i) values were found to increase with increasing applied Fe(VI) dose (0.56-2.24 mgFe/L), increasing temperature (5-30 °C), and decreasing pH conditions (pH 6-11). The Fe(VI) dose effect suggested that an unidentified Fe byproduct also contributed to inactivation. Temperature dependence was characterized by an activation energy of 39(±6) kJ mol(-1), and k(i) increased >50-fold when pH decreased from 11 to 6. The pH effect was quantitatively described by parallel reactions with HFeO(4)(-) and FeO(4)(2-). Mass spectrometry and qRT-PCR analyses demonstrated that both capsid protein and genome damage increased with the extent of inactivation, suggesting that both may contribute to phage inactivation. Capsid protein damage, localized in the two regions containing oxidant-sensitive cysteine residues, and protein cleavage in one of the two regions may facilitate genome damage by increasing Fe(VI) access to the interior of the virion.

Title: Evidence that viral RNAs have evolved for efficient, two-stage packaging.
Abstract: Genome packaging is an essential step in virus replication and a potential drug target. Single-stranded RNA viruses have been thought to encapsidate their genomes by gradual co-assembly with capsid subunits. In contrast, using a single molecule fluorescence assay to monitor RNA conformation and virus assembly in real time, with two viruses from differing structural families, we have discovered that packaging is a two-stage process. Initially, the genomic RNAs undergo rapid and dramatic (approximately 20-30%) collapse of their solution conformations upon addition of cognate coat proteins. The collapse occurs with a substoichiometric ratio of coat protein subunits and is followed by a gradual increase in particle size, consistent with the recruitment of additional subunits to complete a growing capsid. Equivalently sized nonviral RNAs, including high copy potential in vivo competitor mRNAs, do not collapse. They do support particle assembly, however, but yield many aberrant structures in contrast to viral RNAs that make only capsids of the correct size. The collapse is specific to viral RNA fragments, implying that it depends on a series of specific RNA-protein interactions. For bacteriophage MS2, we have shown that collapse is driven by subsequent protein-protein interactions, consistent with the RNA-protein contacts occurring in defined spatial locations. Conformational collapse appears to be a distinct feature of viral RNA that has evolved to facilitate assembly. Aspects of this process mimic those seen in ribosome assembly.

Title: Accumulation of MS2, GA, and Qβ phages on high density polyethylene (HDPE) and drinking water biofilms under flow/non-flow conditions.
Abstract: Accumulation of enteric viruses on surfaces within a drinking water distribution system was investigated in a reactor using three F-specific RNA bacteriophages (MS2, GA, and Qβ) as models of human pathogenic viruses. The influence of hydrodynamic versus hydrostatic conditions and the effect of the colonization of HDPE surfaces with two-month-old biofilms were assessed for virus accumulation on surfaces. In order to work under controlled laminar conditions and to study various wall shear stresses at the same time, a new rotating disc reactor was designed. Among the wall shear rates applied in the reactor (450 to 1640 s(-1)) no significant differences were observed concerning both the total number of bacteria, which was found to be around 1.7 × 10(7) cells/cm(2) and the virus concentrations on surfaces were about 3 × 10(4), 5 × 10(5) and 3 × 10(5) eq PFU/cm(2) for MS2, GA and Qβ phages, respectively. Comparison between static versus dynamic conditions revealed that both Brownian diffusion and convective diffusion were involved in the transport of these soft colloidal particles and an increase reaching about 1 log in virus concentrations measured on surfaces appeared when hydrodynamic conditions where applied. Our results also showed the influence of the colonization by two-month-old drinking water biofilms which led to a change in the level of virus adhesion. The implication of the physico-chemical properties was also underlined since different adhesion profiles were obtained for the three bacteriophages and MS2 phage was found to be the less adherent one whatever the conditions applied.

Title: Osmolyte-mediated encapsulation of proteins inside MS2 viral capsids.
Abstract: The encapsulation of enzymes in nanometer-sized compartments has the potential to enhance and control enzymatic activity, both in vivo and in vitro. Despite this potential, there is little quantitative data on the effect of encapsulation in a well-defined compartment under varying conditions. To gain more insight into these effects, we have characterized two improved methods for the encapsulation of heterologous molecules inside bacteriophage MS2 viral capsids. First, attaching DNA oligomers to a molecule of interest and incubating it with MS2 coat protein dimers yielded reassembled capsids that packaged the tagged molecules. The addition of a protein-stabilizing osmolyte, trimethylamine-N-oxide, significantly increased the yields of reassembly. Second, we found that expressed proteins with genetically encoded negatively charged peptide tags could also induce capsid reassembly, resulting in high yields of reassembled capsids containing the protein. This second method was used to encapsulate alkaline phosphatase tagged with a 16 amino acid peptide. The purified encapsulated enzyme was found to have the same K(m) value and a slightly lower k(cat) value than the free enzyme, indicating that this method of encapsulation had a minimal effect on enzyme kinetics. This method provides a practical and potentially scalable way of studying the complex effects of encapsulating enzymes in protein-based compartments.

Title: Portable automatic bioaerosol sampling system for rapid on-site detection of targeted airborne microorganisms.
Abstract: Bioaerosols could cause various severe human and animal diseases and their opportune and qualitative precise detection and control is becoming a significant scientific and technological topic for consideration. Over the last few decades bioaerosol detection has become an important bio-defense related issue. Many types of portable and stationary bioaerosol samplers have been developed and, in some cases, integrated into automated detection systems utilizing various microbiological techniques for analysis of collected microbes. This paper describes a personal sampler used in conjunction with a portable real-time PCR technique. It was found that a single fluorescent dye could be successfully used in multiplex format for qualitative detection of numerous targeted bioaerosols in one PCR tube making the suggested technology a reliable "first alert" device. This approach has been specifically developed and successfully verified for rapid detection of targeted microorganisms by portable PCR devices, which is especially important under field conditions, where the number of microorganisms of interest usually exceeds the number of available PCR reaction tubes. The approach allows detecting targeted microorganisms and triggering some corresponding sanitary and quarantine procedures to localize possible spread of dangerous infections. Following detailed analysis of the sample under controlled laboratory conditions could be used to exactly identify which particular microorganism out of a targeted group has been rapidly detected in the field. It was also found that the personal sampler has a collection efficiency higher than 90% even for small-sized viruses (>20 nm) and stable performance over extended operating periods. In addition, it was found that for microorganisms used in this project (bacteriophages MS2 and T4) elimination of nucleic acids isolation and purification steps during sample preparation does not lead to the system sensitivity reduction, which is extremely important for development of miniature bioaerosol monitoring instrumentation in the future.

Title: Combination of crossflow ultrafiltration, monolithic affinity filtration, and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR for rapid concentration and quantification of model viruses in water.
Abstract: We present a rapid and effective adsorption-elution method based on monolithic affinity filtration (MAF) for the concentration and purification of waterborne viruses. The MAF column consists of a hydrolyzed macroporous epoxy-based polymer. High recoveries were achieved by columns for the bacterial virus (bacteriophage) MS2 110 (±19)%, as model organism, as well as for human adenoviruses 42.4 (±3.4)% and murine noroviruses 42.6 (±1.9)%. This new concentration and purification method was combined with crossflow ultrafiltration (CUF). Because of the adsorption of the examined viruses to the macroporous surface of the MAF column at pH 3, concentrated matrix components by CUF can be removed. Bacteriophages MS2 were spiked in tap water and concentrated with the new CUF-MAF concentration method by a volumetric factor of 10(4) within 33 min. Furthermore, the detection limit for quantification of bacteriophage MS2 by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) could be improved from 79.47 to 0.0056 GU mL(-1) by a factor of 1.4 × 10(4). In a first study, we have shown that this method could also be applied for river water containing naturally MS2 and MS2-like phages.

Title: Inactivation and tailing during UV254 disinfection of viruses: contributions of viral aggregation, light shielding within viral aggregates, and recombination.
Abstract: UV disinfection of viruses frequently leads to tailing after an initial exponential decay. Aggregation, light shielding, recombination, or resistant virus subpopulations have been proposed as explanations; however, none of these options has been conclusively demonstrated. This study investigates how aggregation affects virus inactivation by UV(254) in general, and the tailing phenomenon in particular. Bacteriophage MS2 was aggregated by lowering the solution pH before UV(254) disinfection. Aggregates were redispersed prior to enumeration to obtain the remaining fraction of individual infectious viruses. Results showed that initial inactivation kinetics were similar for viruses incorporated in aggregates (up to 1000 nm in radius) and dispersed viruses; however, aggregated viruses started to tail more readily than dispersed ones. Neither light shielding, nor the presence of resistant subpopulations could account for the tailing. Instead, tailing was consistent with recombination arising from the simultaneous infection of the host by several impaired viruses. We argue that UV(254) treatment of aggregates permanently fused a fraction of viruses, which increased the likelihood of multiple infection of a host cell and ultimately enabled the production of infective viruses via recombination.

Title: Selection and evaluation of single domain antibodies toward MS2 phage and coat protein.
Abstract: MS2 phage (MS2 Ø) is a coli phage, non-pathogenic to eukaryotic cells, which has been used as a simulant for viral biothreats, such as those causing smallpox and hemorrhagic fever. MS2 Ø consists of an icosahedral capsid, 28nm in diameter, and a single stranded RNA genome; the viral capsid is composed of 180 copies of coat protein (CP). In this study, we isolated anti-MS2 Ø single domain antibodies (sdAbs) for the sensitive detection of the MS2 Ø. To achieve this, a first immune sdAb library was prepared from llamas immunized with purified coat protein and a second from animals immunized with MS2 Ø. By panning the two libraries against CP, MS2 Ø, or alternating between the two targets, anti-MS2 Ø and anti-CP sdAbs were selected, sequenced, and characterized for their binding affinity. Both direct binding assays and capture sandwich assays were performed on the MAGPIX platform. One of the best anti-MS2 Ø sdAb, Lib2CP12H, could detect MS2 Ø concentrations as low as 1.45ng/mL (∼5.0E+6pfu/mL), providing equivalent detection to conventional antibodies. This sdAb is thermally stable with a melting temperature around 60°C and recovered 80% of its secondary structure after heat denaturation.

Title: Inactivation of human norovirus surrogates by benzalkonium chloride, potassium peroxymonosulfate, tannic acid, and gallic acid.
Abstract: Novel methods to effectively disinfect contact surfaces and prevent human norovirus transmission are essential. The effect of benzalkonium chloride (BAC), potassium peroxymonosulfate (KPMS), tannic acid (TA), and gallic acid (GA) on enteric virus surrogates, murine norovirus (MNV-1), feline calicivirus (FCV-F9), and bacteriophage MS2 was studied. Viruses at high (∼7 log₁₀ PFU/mL) or low (∼5 log₁₀ PFU/mL) titers were mixed with equal volumes of BAC (0.2, 0.5, and 1 mg/mL), KPMS (5, 10, and 20 mg/mL), TA (0.02 and 0.2 mg/mL), GA (0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 mg/mL), or water and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Viral infectivity after triplicate treatments was evaluated using plaque assays in duplicate. Low titers of FCV-F9 and MNV-1 were completely reduced, while low-titer MS2 was reduced by 1.7-1.8 log₁₀ PFU/mL with BAC at all three concentrations. High-titer FCV-F9 was reduced by 2.87, 3.08, and 3.25 log₁₀ PFU/mL, and high-titer MNV-1 was reduced by 1.55, 2.32, and 2.75 log₁₀ PFU/mL with BAC at 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/mL, respectively. High-titer MS2 was reduced by ∼2 log₁₀ PFU/mL with BAC at all three concentrations. KPMS at all three concentrations reduced high and low titers of FCV-F9 and MS2 and low-titer MNV-1 to undetectable levels, while high-titer MNV-1 was reduced by 0.92 and 3.44 log₁₀ PFU/mL with KMPS at 2.5 and 5 mg/mL, respectively. TA at 0.2 mg/mL only reduced high-titer FCV-F9 by 0.98 log₁₀ PFU/mL and low-titer FCV-F9 by 1.95 log₁₀ PFU/mL. GA at 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mg/mL reduced low-titer FCV-F9 by 2.50, 2.36, and 0.86 log₁₀ PFU/mL, respectively with negligible effects against high-titer FCV-F9. BAC and KPMS show promise to be used as broad-spectrum contact surface disinfectants for prevention of noroviral surrogate contamination.

Title: Bacteriophage removal by Ni/Al layered double hydroxide in batch and flow-through column experiments.
Abstract: The objective of this study was to investigate the removal of the bacteriophage MS2 by Ni/Al layered double hydroxide (LDH). Batch experiments were performed using a powder form of Ni/Al LDH under various conditions. Column experiments were also performed under flow-through conditions with Ni/Al LDH coated sand. Batch tests showed that the powder form of Ni/Al LDH was effective for bacteriophage removal under the given experimental conditions (LDH dose of 2.5 g L(-1); initial MS2 concentration of 1.35 × 10(5) plaque forming unit (pfu) mL(-1)) with a removal capacity of 5.5 × 10(7) pfu g(-1). The results also indicated that the effect of the solution pH on the bacteriophage removal was minimal at pH 4.3-9.4. The influence of divalent anions (SO(2-) (4), CO(2-) (3), HPO(2-) (4); concentrations 1-100 mM) on the removal of the bacteriophage was significant, while the effects of monovalent anions (NO(-) (3), Cl(-)) were negligible. Column experiments showed that the log removal of MS2 was 4.51 in columns containing 100% Ni/Al LDH-coated sand, while it was 0.02 in columns containing 100% quartz sand (initial MS2 concentration of approximately 7.0 × 10(5) pfu mL(-1); flow rate of 0.5 mL min(-1)). These findings indicated that Ni/Al LDH-coated sand was far more effective at removing bacteriophage than sand alone. This study demonstrates that Ni/Al LDH can be used for virus removal in water treatment and filtration applications.

Title: Alumoxane/ferroxane nanoparticles for the removal of viral pathogens: the importance of surface functionality to nanoparticle activity.
Abstract: A bi-functional nano-composite coating has been created on a porous Nomex® fabric support as a trap for aspirated virus contaminated water. Nomex® fabric was successively dip-coated in solutions containing cysteic acid functionalized alumina (alumoxane) nanoparticles and cysteic acid functionalized iron oxide (ferroxane) nanoparticles to form a nanoparticle coated Nomex® (NPN) fabric. From SEM and EDX the nanoparticle coating of the Nomex® fibers is uniform, continuous, and conformal. The NPN was used as a filter for aspirated bacteriophage MS2 viruses using end-on filtration. All measurements were repeated to give statistical reliability. The NPN fabrics show a large decrease as compared to Nomex® alone or alumoxane coated Nomex®. An increase in the ferroxane content results in an equivalent increase in virus retention. This suggests that it is the ferroxane that has an active role in deactivating and/or binding the virus. Heating the NPN to 160 °C results in the loss of cysteic acid functional groups (without loss of the iron nanoparticle's core structure) and the resulting fabric behaves similar to that of untreated Nomex®, showing that the surface functionalization of the nanoparticles is vital for the surface collapse of aspirated water droplets and the absorption and immobilization of the MS2 viruses. Thus, for virus immobilization, it is not sufficient to have iron oxide nanoparticles per se, but the surface functionality of a nanoparticle is vitally important in ensuring efficacy.

Title: Effectiveness of chitosan on the inactivation of enteric viral surrogates.
Abstract: Chitosan is known to have bactericidal and antifungal activity. Although human noroviruses are the leading cause of non-bacterial gastroenteritis, information on the efficacy of chitosan against foodborne viruses is very limited. The objective of this work was to determine the effectiveness of different molecular weight chitosans against the cultivable human norovirus and enteric virus surrogates, feline calicivirus, FCV-F9, murine norovirus, MNV-1, and bacteriophages, MS2 and phiX174. Five purified chitosans (53, 222, 307, 421, ~1150 kDa) were dissolved in water, 1% acetic acid, or aqueous HCl pH = 4.3, sterilized by membrane filtration, and mixed with equal volume of virus to obtain a final concentration of 0.7% chitosan and 5 log(10) PFU/ml virus. Virus-chitosan suspensions were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. Untreated viruses in PBS, in PBS with acetic acid, and in PBS with HCl were tested as controls. Each experiment was run in duplicate and replicated at least twice. Water-soluble chitosan (53 kDa) reduced phiX174, MS2, FCV-F9 and MNV-1 titers by 0.59, 2.44, 3.36, and 0.34 log(10) PFU/ml respectively. Chitosans in acetic acid decreased phiX174 by 1.19-1.29, MS2 by 1.88-5.37, FCV-F9 by 2.27-2.94, and MNV-1 by 0.09-0.28 log(10) PFU/ml, respectively. Increasing the MW of chitosan corresponded with an increasing antiviral effect on MS2, but did not appear to play a role for the other three tested viral surrogates. Overall, chitosan treatments showed the greatest reduction for FCV-F9, and MS2 followed by phiX174, and with no significant effect on MNV-1.

Title: Adhesion of human pathogenic enteric viruses and surrogate viruses to inert and vegetal food surfaces.
Abstract: Enteric viruses, particularly human Noroviruses (NoV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV), are key food-borne pathogens. The attachment of these pathogens to foodstuff and food-contact surfaces is an important mechanism in the human contamination process. Studies were done to investigate the nature of the physicochemical forces, such as hydrophobic and electrostatic ones, involved in the interaction virus/matrix but, at this day, only few data are available concerning surface properties of viruses and prediction of the adhesion capacity of one specific virus onto matrices is still very difficult. The purpose of this study was to propose a reference system, including a representative virus surrogate, able to predict as close as possible behaviour of pathogenic viruses in term of adhesion on inert (stainless steel and polypropylene) and food surfaces (lettuce leaves, strawberries and raspberries). The adhesion of human pathogenic enteric viruses, cultivable strain of HAV and non-cultivable strains of human NoV (genogroups I and II), have been quantified and compared to these of human enteric viruses surrogates, included the MNV-1 and three F-specific RNA bacteriophages (MS2, GA and Qβ). A standardized approach was developed to assess and quantify viral adhesion on tested matrices after a contact time with each virus using real-time RT-PCR. Methods used for virus recovery were in accordance with the CEN recommendations, including a bovine Enterovirus type 1 as control to monitor the efficiency of the extraction process and amplification procedure from directly extracted or eluted samples. The adhesion of human pathogenic viruses, ranging from 0.1 to 2%, could be comparable for all matrices studied, except for NoV GII on soft fruits. Adhesion percentages obtained for the studied surrogate virus and phages were shown to be comparable to those of HAV and NoV on inert and lettuce surfaces. The MNV-1 appeared as the best candidate to simulate adhesion phenomena of all human pathogenic enteric viruses on all studied surfaces, while MS2 and GA bacteriophages could be a good alternative as model of viral adhesion on inert and lettuce surfaces. These results will be usable to design relevant experimental systems integrating adhesion behaviour of enteric viruses in the assessment of the efficiency of a technological or hygienic industrial process.

Title: Consideration of emerging pollutants in groundwater-based reuse concepts.
Abstract: Elimination of pathogens and emerging pollutants represents a key factor in integrated water resources management in arid regions. Within the SMART Jordan Valley project it is the objective of this study to assess the occurrence and examine the elimination of selected emerging pollutants and pathogens in waste water treatment and aquifer recharge. In batch and soil column studies non-chlorinated organophosphorous compounds (tri-n-butylphosphate, triphenylphosphate) and endocrine disruptors (e.g. 17-ß-estradiol, bisphenol A) proved to be biodegradable, while the X-ray contrast agents iomeprol and iopromide were eliminated in the soil columns only, and the chlorinated trialkylphosphates showed persistency. Treating waste water in a membrane bioreactor (MBR) in combination with powdered activated carbon (PAC) resulted in considerable removal rates also for the more persistent compounds such as the antiepileptic carbamazepine. Viruses were shown to be present in most of the Jordan Valley surface water samples. MBR treatment resulted in a decrease of MS2 bacteriophages used as model viruses.

Title: Study on the removal efficiency of UF membranes using bacteriophages in bench-scale and semi-technical scale.
Abstract: To determine the removal efficiency of ultrafiltration (UF) membranes for nano-particles in the size range of viruses the state of the art uses challenge tests with virus-spiked water. This work focuses on bench-scale and semi-technical scale experiments. Different experimental parameters influencing the removal efficiency of the tested UF membrane modules were analyzed and evaluated for bench- and semi-technical scale experiments. Organic matter in the water matrix highly influenced the removal of the tested bacteriophages MS2 and phiX174. Less membrane fouling (low ΔTMP) led to a reduced phage reduction. Increased flux positively affected phage removal in natural waters. The tested bacteriophages MS2 and phiX174 revealed different removal properties. MS2, which is widely used as a model organism to determine virus removal efficiencies of membranes, mostly showed a better removal than phiX174 for the natural water qualities tested. It seems that MS2 is possibly a less conservative surrogate for human enteric virus removal than phiX174. In bench-scale experiments log removal values (LRV) for MS2 of 2.5-6.0 and of 2.5-4.5 for phiX174 were obtained for the examined range of parameters. Phage removal obtained with differently fabricated semi-technical modules was quite variable for comparable parameter settings, indicating that module fabrication can lead to differing results. Potting temperature and module size were identified as influencing factors. In conclusion, careful attention has to be paid to the choice of experimental settings and module potting when using bench-scale or semi-technical scale experiments for UF membrane challenge tests.

Title: Virus inactivation in the presence of quartz sand under static and dynamic batch conditions at different temperatures.
Abstract: Virus inactivation is one of the most important factors that controls virus fate and transport in the subsurface. In this study the inactivation of viruses in the presence of quartz sand was examined. The bacteriophages MS2 and ΦX174 were used as model viruses. Experiments were performed at 4°C and 20°C, under constant controlled conditions, to investigate the effect of virus type, temperature, sand size, and initial virus concentration on virus inactivation. The experimental virus inactivation data were satisfactorily represented by a pseudo-first order expression with time-dependent rate coefficients. Furthermore, the results indicated that virus inactivation was substantially affected by the ambient temperature and initial virus concentration. The inactivation rate of MS2 was shown to be greater than that of ΦX174. However, the greatest inactivation was observed for MS2 without the presence of sand, at 20°C. Sand surfaces offered protection against inactivation especially under static conditions. However, no obvious relationship between sand particle size and virus inactivation could be established from the experimental data. Moreover, the inactivation rates were shown to increase with decreasing virus concentration.

Title: Evaluation of four different systems for extraction of RNA from stool suspensions using MS-2 coliphage as an exogenous control for RT-PCR inhibition.
Abstract: Knowing when, and to what extent co-extracted inhibitors interfere with molecular RNA diagnostic assays is of utmost importance. The QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (A); MagNA Pure LC2.0 Automatic extractor (B); KingFisher (C); and NucliSENS EasyMag (D) RNA extraction systems were evaluated for extraction efficiency and co-purification of inhibitors from stool suspensions. Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) of MS-2 coliphage spiked into each system's lysis buffer served as an external control for both. Cycle thresholds (Cts) of the MS2 were determined for RNA extracted from stool suspensions containing unknown (n = 93) or varying amounts of inhibitors (n = 92). Stool suspensions from the latter group were also used to determine whether MS-2 and enterovirus rRT-PCR inhibitions were correlated. Specifically 23 RNA extracts from stool suspensions were spiked with enterovirus RNA after extraction and 13 of these stool suspension were spiked with intact enterovirus before extraction. MS2 rRT-PCR inhibition varied for RNAs extracted by the different systems. Inhibition was noted in 12 (13.0%), 26 (28.3%), 7 (7.6%), and 7 (7.6%) of the first 93 RNA extracts, and 58 (63.0%), 55 (59.8%), 37 (40.2%) and 30 (32.6%) of the second 92 extracts for A, B, C, and D, respectively. Furthermore, enterovirus rRT-PCR inhibition correlated with MS2 rRT-PCR inhibition for added enterovirus RNA or virus particles. In conclusion, rRT-PCR for MS-2 RNA is a good predictor of inhibition of enterovirus RNA extracted from stool suspensions. EasyMag performed the best, however all four extraction methods were suitable provided that external controls identified problematic samples.

Title: Biochemical analysis of long non-coding RNA-containing ribonucleoprotein complexes.
Abstract: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), once relegated to junk products of the genome, are becoming better appreciated for the myriad functions they play in cellular processes. It is clear that for most of the cases studied, lncRNAs carry out their functions at least in part through interactions with proteins. Here we present two complementary biochemical methods for the analysis of lncRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein complexes, hereafter referred to as RNPs. The first strategy offers users the ability to purify RNPs based on a protein component and to analyze the spectrum of lncRNAs, other proteins, and, if present, other types of RNAs that are bound to it. The second makes use of a bacteriophage MS2 binding-site affinity-handle grafted onto an lncRNA of interest to investigate the proteins and RNAs that co-purify with the tagged RNA.

The log removal values (LRVs) for microbial indicators increased as the influent concentrations increased. Among the wide range of MBR systems evaluated, the total and fecal coliform bacteria and indigenous MS-2 coliphage were detected in 32, 9 and 15% of the samples, respectively; the 50th percentile LRVs were measured at 6.6, 5.9 and 4.5 logs, respectively.

Title: Mg/Al layered double hydroxide for bacteriophage removal in aqueous solution.
Abstract: The objective of this study was to investigate the removal of bacteriophages in Mg/Al layered double hydroxide (LDH). Batch experiments were performed with bacteriophage MS2 in a powder form of Mg/Al LDH under various LDH doses. Column experiments were also performed under flow-through condition with bacteriophages MS2 and phiX174 in Mg/Al LDH immobilized on sand surfaces. Batch tests demonstrated that the powder form of Mg/Al LDH was effective in removing MS2 with the removal capacity of 2.2 × 10(8) plaque forming unit (pfu)/g under the given experimental conditions (LDH dose = 2 g/L; initial MS2 concentration = 4.61 × 10(5) pfu/mL). Column experiments showed that the log removal of phiX174 was 4.40 in columns containing 100% Mg/Al LDH-coated sand while it was 0.05 in 100% quartz sand. These findings indicated that Mg/Al LDH-coated sand was effective in removing bacteriophages compared with sand. A more than 4 log removal (=5.44) of MS2 was achieved in 100% Mg/Al LDH-coated sand.

Title: Development of an optimized method for the recovery of infectious F-RNA coliphage MS2 from meat.
Abstract: F-RNA coliphages, part of the gut flora and likely to be deposited on meat along with other enteric organisms during carcass dressing and processing, may be regarded as an indicator and/or surrogate for potential zoonotic enteric viruses. There is no recommended sampling method for viruses on meats and there is a lack of information on the attachment of enteric viruses or F-RNA coliphages to gauze swabs, cellulose sponges and muscle and fat tissue. The objective of this work was to optimize the recovery of MS2 from muscle and fat tissue of meat by comparing phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 10% beef extract pH 7.2, and tryptose phosphate (2.9%) glycine (6%) broth pH 9.5 as eluants. The sampling techniques of excision, swabbing with gauze or cellulose sponges were compared with homogenizing the inoculated entire muscle or fat surface area. The recovery of MS2 from cellulose sponges using beef extract was significantly higher (P=0.001) than tryptose phosphate glycine broth which was significantly higher (P=0.0001) than PBS. There was no significant difference in the recovery between tryptose phosphate glycine broth and beef extract (P=0.92) and there was no significant difference between PBS and beef extract (P=0.10) when MS2 was recovered from gauze. No significant differences were observed between the different eluants with muscle tissue (P=0.91). When MS2 was recovered from muscle tissue with beef extract significant differences were observed (P=0.002); the sampling techniques of homogenizing the entire sample (56%) was equal to excision (43%) (P=0.23) and swabbing with a cellulose sponge (38%) (P=0.06) which were significantly higher than swabbing with gauze (28%), a second grouping of means indicated that homogenizing the entire sample was significantly higher than the other three sampling techniques. When MS2 was recovered from fat, significant differences were observed (P=0.000); homogenizing the entire sample (78%) was equal to excision (74%), which were significantly higher than swabbing with gauze (49%) or cellulose sponge (29%). The recovery of MS2 from meat is affected by the sampling technique. When choosing a nondestructive sampling method such as a cellulose sponge, a higher recovery can be obtained with beef extract as an eluant.

Title: Effects of relative humidity and spraying medium on UV decontamination of filters loaded with viral aerosols.
Abstract: Although respirators and filters are designed to prevent the spread of pathogenic aerosols, a stockpile shortage is anticipated during the next flu pandemic. Contact transfer and reaerosolization of collected microbes from used respirators are also a concern. An option to address these potential problems is UV irradiation, which inactivates microbes by dimerizing thymine/uracil in nucleic acids. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of transmission mode and environmental conditions on decontamination efficiency by UV. In this study, filters were contaminated by different transmission pathways (droplet and aerosol) using three spraying media (deionized water [DI], beef extract [BE], and artificial saliva [AS]) under different humidity levels (30% [low relative humidity {LRH}], 60% [MRH], and 90% [HRH]). UV irradiation at constant intensity was applied for two time intervals at each relative humidity condition. The highest inactivation efficiency (IE), around 5.8 logs, was seen for DI aerosols containing MS2 on filters at LRH after applying a UV intensity of 1.0 mW/cm(2) for 30 min. The IE of droplets containing MS2 was lower than that of aerosols containing MS2. Absorption of UV by high water content and shielding of viruses near the center of the aggregate are considered responsible for this trend. Across the different media, IEs in AS and in BE were much lower than in DI for both aerosol and droplet transmission, indicating that solids present in AS and BE exhibited a protective effect. For particles sprayed in a protective medium, RH is not a significant parameter.

Rating: ChatCompletionMessage(content='This abstract is not directly relevant to the goal of modifying the MS2 phage lysis protein to eliminate the need for binding DNAJ in order to enhance its efficacy in phage therapy for multidrug-resistant E. coli. It primarily focuses on the decontamination efficiency of UV irradiation on filters contaminated with MS2 phage under different conditions. Although the study provides insight into the inactivation efficiency of MS2 phage using UV irradiation, it does not address the specific modification of the MS2 phage lysis protein for therapeutic purposes. \n\nRating: 2/10', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)

Title: Removal of bacteriophages with different surface charges by diverse ceramic membrane materials in pilot spiking tests.
Abstract: This study examines mechanisms for removal of bacteriophages (MS2 and phiX174) by ceramic membranes without application of flocculants. The ceramic membranes considered included ultra- and microfiltration membranes of different materials. Phages were spiked into the feed water in pilot scale tests in a waterworks. The membranes with pore sizes of 10 nm provided a 2.5-4.0 log removal of the phages. For pore sizes of 50 nm, the log removal dropped to 0.96-1.8. The membrane with a pore size of 200 nm did not remove phages. So, the removal of both MS2- and phiX174-phages depended on the pore size of the membranes. But apart from pore size also other factors influence the removal of phages. Removal was 0.5-0.9 log higher for MS2-phages compared with phiX174-phages. Size exclusion seems to be the major but not the only mechanism which influences the efficiency of phage removal by ceramic membranes.

Rating: ChatCompletionMessage(content='This study, although interesting, is not directly relevant to the goal of modifying the MS2 phage lysis protein to not require DNAJ binding for use in phage therapy against multidrug-resistant E. coli. The research focuses on the removal of MS2 and phiX174 phages by ceramic membranes based on pore size, without addressing the lysis protein modification. While understanding phage behavior and interactions with membranes is valuable for phage therapy applications, this study does not provide insights into the lysis protein modification strategy. \n\nRating: 2/10', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)
